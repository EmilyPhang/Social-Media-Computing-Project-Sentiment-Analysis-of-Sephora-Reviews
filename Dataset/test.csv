i really wanted to love this cleanser but it just dried the crap out of my skin returned.,negative
i struggle with bad acne and oily skin! i read prior reviews after already purchasing this product. i was worried after seeing every body complaining about the texture and how it was gritty! i received the product and the first thing i did was text it out and now see what the disappointment was about. it was nowhere near as gritty as others indicated! i was blown away. the product stung depending on how much i placed on my face. i do the recommended amount and the sting is not as bad! i am used to vitmain c on the skin so i was prepared for it. the grittiness is not as bad as they stated. it sinks in the skin. i use it only for pm since i have such oily skin. so far i loved the results! my face has not been this smooth in over a year! love the product!,positive
i have been using this for a while and i do not see much of a difference in my skin. it also seems to have bleached or discolored my pillow cases pretty badly.,negative
it is fine........................................................,neutral
"i got because i wanted to try the ordinary line, i used it once a week as per the directions..after application the skin feels soft and a little brighter i feel..it did not help with the acne much to be honest maybe because it is recommended to be used only once a week...but i would recommend to try it and i will be buying it again..",neutral
"beyond the fact that this is way too expensive, it is just not a good serum. it is runny, super sticky, and it dries so fast i barely have time to rub it into my skin. save your money",negative
i received this product complimentary from paulas choice. i love a good exfoliator and this is one! it makes my skin feel amazing! i have sensitive skin and it does not irritate my face at all. definitely high quality.,positive
"one of my favorite products, and i notice a difference immediately on my skin when used! i do have sensitive skin so i layer it on every other night under moisturizer. it is pricey so a little goes a long way, and i always pick it up during the sephora sales.",positive
"i really wanted to love this cleanser and all of its aesthetics! the packaging is sleek. the pump dispenses well. the bottle is a heavy glass, the color choice is beautiful. when using, one pump is definitely not enough. especially if you have a full face of makeup. for its claims, i do not see an amazing difference in using such cleanser. i have acne pronecombination skin. for the price, i expected more. definitely disappointed, sadly i will be returning this.",negative
yes finally something that works i have been using this for days and wow along with paulas choice liquid this has drastically changed my skin after a horrible laser treatment made my face get fungal acne it had not gone away i have tried pills creams acne face washes brushes you name it this is magic in a bottle any one who suffers from acne knows how it affects your self esteem i was so skeptical to buy because i have a cabinet full of stuff i have tried that is not worked but i can already tell this will be a rebuy thank you lord and kate,positive
"it is fine as a moisturizer under my makeup, but i do not think it is anything special. i do love this brand, and i will use it until it is gone, but i would not repurchase. it just feels a little sticky.",neutral
"it is like using a body soap, excepts it is liquid. nothing special at all. glad i got the small size to try. it is like those old bae soap that lives a film on your face.",neutral
"i love kiehls products. they are affordable and you get a lot of good product. i have dry skin and i purchased this since i was out of my other kiehls cleanser and thought i would try a new one. while it does do a great job removing makeup and dirt and the smell is decent, it leaves my skin feelings very dry and tight. the texture is like mousse with tiny bit of sand exfoliant. i do not understand how this can be a daily cleanser when it kind of feels like a scrub.",neutral
"got this as a sample and i looooove it. this has eased the look of my fine lines and crows feet gives my eye area a gentle glow. under-eye concealer sure looks a lot better now since using it for only a week! i do use morning and night for those results. i bought the full size on black friday sale, i love it so much. if there is extra on my fingers, i will pay the extra bit on the rest of my face.",positive
"first of all, this moisturizer smells so good! it is floral but not too strong, and it fades quickly so it is not distracting. the lotion itself is pretty thick, so it might not be necessary for humid climates or warmer temperatures when skin is not so dry, but it is great for really dry skin, dry or unhealthy air like los angeles, and i winter temps. it spreads easily and since it is so thick, a little goes a long way. it settles quickly but it did feel a little bit sticky for the first few minutes, so i would recommend letting it settle before applying any other product. once it does set in, it is very soothing!",positive
"i feel like this eye cream has helped manage my fine lines but i have not noticed much of an improvement in my dark circles...maybe ever so slightly. also, sometimes, it makes the skin around my eyes red and burn a tiny bit and definitely burns if it melts into my eyes. with all of that being said, i like the texture and the smell, just probably would not buy again.",neutral
"i do not usually write reviews like this but i think it is important! i had a friend recommend this product to me. i started using it because i have very oily skin. i recently moved to a warm place so i thought this would definitely help with humidity and oil control. i immediately started breaking out like crazy!!! i have never had this sort of reaction. i blamed the new climate and change. i was having so much extra oil and pimples everywhere. after a month of my skin getting worse and worse each day, i decided to change back to my old moisturizer. in literally one day i saw a difference. i stopped using it completely and now it is back to normal. i hate to write a negative review like this but i wanted to incase someone with my skin type was thinking of buying this product. it is not good!! i do enjoy other products from summer fridays, just not this specific one.",negative
"this toner it is ok, i mean i thought that my skin would be glowing as i thought but not really. smells good, not my favorite...",neutral
"i wanted to love this product, it is consistency is thick and rich. which is quite nice. unfortunately, i had a bad reaction.",negative
i have been trying this product for a week and a half and i do not feel like it has helped with my breakouts. plus it has a strong smell of the succinic acid so if you are sensitive to smells you would not really like this product,neutral
"hardly any product, impossible to get out of the container. worst of all it majorly pills and leaves green residue all under my eye",negative
leaves my skin feeling refreshed. i also love that it is a quick facial. this has helped my dryness and peeling for my skin.,positive
"love the way this makes my skin feel hydrated and plump. that being said though, it definitely clogs my pores and gives weird texture to my skin. i am extra sad because i definitely saw it helping to treat my hyperpigmentation but i have had to stop using it.",neutral
"i love the ordinary, but this product does absolutely nothing.",negative
make sure you shake it a lot if not that thing will squirt at you. but live the glow and long lasting,neutral
absolutely love this night cream. within a couple days my eczema patches and redness on my cheeks had greatly diminished. it also hydrate very well without being too greasy for my t-zone. would buy again.,positive
"i heard this was a super gentle cleanser, since i have sensitive skin i thought i would try this out. even i feel like it is just not getting the job done. i feel like i have to cleanse twice, or even three times it is just not great. plus i had not had any breakouts in a while and i got them after i started testing this. you can find something else for the same price or cheaper that will do a better job.",negative
"this used to be my holy grail hydrating serum. i am not sure if it ever helped with my melasma patches, but was unique and worth every penny for its dewy, non-sticky formula.. suddenly the bottle design looked different, and the serum felt like it had something slippery or siliconey added, and has lost the non-slippery hydration i loved. it is still good, but i am not a fan of slick siliconey feeling serums, so i likely will not repurcchase.",neutral
"i am not sure about this product yet, i am just incorporated at my skincare routine",positive
"really wanted to love this. the packaging is nice, it feels smooth and lovely going on, and the moisture it delivers is great for super dry skin. however, my skin hated something in this cream. especially after using my rx tretinoin my face would turn beet red hot and prickly. other moisturizers have not had this effect and i certainly do not have sensitive skin. this would randomly happen on my non-tret nights too. i must be reactive to one of the ingredients, just wish i knew which one. i can see how this would be a beautiful cream for those of us with super dry skin, it just did not work for me.",neutral
"as convenient the stick design may be, the product is a little tough which makes it a little difficult to smoothly apply.",neutral
"honestly it did not do much for me. it was the tiniest bit hydrating in the winter my skin gets really dried out and very sensitive. the good thing is, it did not break me out.",neutral
i had higher expectations for this stuff... i have combo and acne prone skin. this just felt like a basic face wash you would buy at a drug store. it did nothing for me. when i use products i want it to actually do something and this was not it.,negative
i tried it once with my normal skin care routine and only had it on for mins. over the next hours my skin has broken out like crazy! if you have somewhat sensitive skin avoid this.,negative
"love the natural colour this tan creates and the fact that it does not smell bad. unfortunately it does streak and can be hard to get an even application. you have to really rub it in precisely and thoroughly, and even then i still get some dark spots. i am going to use up the bottle but will probably try the drops next.",neutral
i like the product itself but the packaging is awful. the wooden lid came off and you can see the glue? it ruins the experience of the product as it comes off as cheap.,negative
"i got to give this one a decent product, it provides my face with just enough moisturizing to prevent it from drying and flaky, but it did not do anything else much. so far, i like it but i do not think it is worth the money.",neutral
"takes off face makeup well but stings my eyes like a b!!! which for me, defeats the point of using this product. i use cleansing oils primarily to gently take off my eye makeup and i like to get into my lashes in particular but this ish hurtsss",neutral
i love this stuff! i have been looking for a moisturizer i loved for so long and finally found it. it is the perfect moisturizer for me! this stuff is light enough for my very oily skin but hydrating enough that makes it feel plump and soft. i can just put as much as i want of this without worrying about being shiny or breaking out. it makes my skin feel sooo good after putting it on. my skin has been the happiest it is been in years. it is expensive but it definitely is worth it for me. i will keep buying it.,positive
"i loved this serum when i got through a sample of it from last years birthday gift enough to buy the full size a few weeks later. having just finished it, i think it is too expensive. i finished the bottle within months and i have a fairly small face so i never used more than drops each time i counted because this product is expensive! it is very hydrating and definitely brightened my complexion through the winter in the northeast, but i do not really see a difference in the dark spots or acne scars i have. it is worth it for dry skin, it is a pretty great hydrating serum, but it is too expensive just for hydration so i do not think it is worth it.",neutral
"i just got this product, my face turns red when i use it. not sure if other people have the same problem.",negative
"i love it! it works well with no irritation. i layer it on top of the lactic acid and under indie lee squalane oil and moisturizer. it is helping with texture for sure, and pores, fine lines are baaaaaaaarely any different, but it is only been a few weeks. i am pretty excited to keep using this regularly. check out the ordinarys site for more instructions on how to use it.",positive
it is a really light cream. kind of like whipped butter? it does not feel heavy but is just as hydrating. i love it! my new favourite moisturizer for sure.,positive
the smell is extremely strong! also if you are not pasty white this will do nothing for your skin it is a very light glow.,negative
i have used this product before and am currently on my second one! and omg it worked wonders for me!! my fungal acne has been treated with little to no bumps showing and my face does not loose moisture that fast after applying this!! totally recommend,positive
i have light skin and used these drops for several days on my legs and arms with moisturizer as directed. i am not seeing much tanning. lightmedium must be too light for light skin. for an expensive product i am very disappointed.,neutral
i had high hopes after reading such great reviews unfortunately it did not work for my hyperpigmentation and melasma. i may need another bottle to see the results. not worth the price,negative
"this honestly smells pretty bad. not like garabge but like way too strong of pine. i felt like i was in a forest having my nose shoved into pine but like x. it is not good guys. also! this was too harsh on my skin, and made it very red afterwards. it stung a little bit.",negative
this has dried me out in places as well as left me so broken-out,negative
"just what my neck area needed. you have to be consistent and use it twice a day to get great results. the texture is non greasy, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quite quickly. i love the deep moisture it provides, and the jar will last for a long time.",positive
"expensive and i did not notice any difference on my skin. i have oilycombination skin. it felt nice on my skin, but that is about it. would not repurchase for the price.",negative
"the spray bottle is awful. it stops working halfway through your tan and you cannot have it upside down or it will not spray. i bought a continuous mist spray bottle and transferred the product into that and got a much better application. for the price of this product, the application bottle should be better. smells so sweet that it is almost sickly.. super quick application with the new bottle though",neutral
"really love the formula and consistency of this moisturizer but the smell is so bad! i thought other reviewers were being dramatic when they wrote how awful it smells, but it really does smell gross. it smells so badstrong like feet that i actually hold my breath while applying. i would repurchase but the smell is so pungent that i will not be buying again",neutral
"i did not notice much of a difference with this product. the only place that seems to be more firmhave less fine lines is my forehead. my smile lines are still very visible and around my eyes fine lines are still very visible after a week and a half of use. i would say this is a pretty average product. one good thing is that my skin did not have any irritation after use and i have pretty sensitive skin. it dries fast. i did not see the results i was looking for with this product. the price point is great, but i wish it actually worked!",neutral
i received with a lower price ticket inside the box. sephora was unprofessional and would not honour there own price ticket. but as far as the product i love it. if they would do right think as a business i would buy from them again. not my error at all!!,positive
"i bought this alongside other products from the ordinary. i have oily acne prone skin and have not had a solid skincare route outside of acne preventing cleanser and a spot treatment! so i did a ton of research before picking the products to try. i ended up getting this, the niacinamide zinc, glycolic acid toner, natural moisturizer ha, retinol and rose hip seed oil. because they were all new products and i have had a lot of breakouts from crappy products, i added them to my routine slowly. i started with niacinamide and week this peeling solution. i was a little nervous my skin might react badly but it only slightly itches when you use it and the sensation goes away after you wash with water. honestly i cannot say enough good things about these products. i have not tried the rose hip seed oil or the retinol slowly adding them in... but my skin has never looked better. ever. i use niacinamide and the moisturizer in the morning after i cleanse my face, and at night use the toner, niacinamide and the moisturizer. every night. times a week i use this peeling solution and it is insane how much of a difference you can see. i have softer, more natural skin with no new acne coming in and decreased pores. it could be because i have been sheltering in place the last month, so i am not wearing much makeup but i really believe this has helped even my complexion so much. it is been about a month and a half with this routine and i am definitely going to continue forever. get it! you will not regret it.",positive
"i finished using the biossance omega repair cream which i love and bought this in my search for a thicker cream to use in the winter. pros it is very moisturizing- creamy but not too thick or heavy. does not feel greasy at all. perfect for dry skin. the packaging is beautiful i love that the spatula is a magnet to the jar. cons personally, it has flared my rosacea a bit- i am not sure why but my guess is the flavouraroma fragrance. the scent is not great, it does not even smell like honey to me. it also leaves my skin a little sticky, and not as soft like the biossance moisturizer. overall i have mixed feelings because i like the ingredients and it feels great for dryness but i do not love the scent or sticky residue.",neutral
seriously does not work. waste of money. tried several times and applied it in the same spot several times as well. no results.,negative
"i was kind of on the fence about this at first, but after using it for a few weeks i actually started to see an improvement in my skin. i am in my early s and have pretty good skin, but i was really starting to notice some loss of firmnesselasticity, especially in my jawline plus i was struggling with increased sensitivity, irritation and constant breakouts on my forehead ah, the joys of the menopausal transition. i am nearly to the end of my st bottle of this and have just re-ordered because wow. my skin is noticeably firmer, i have not had a breakout in weeks, and my skin feels so much more hydrated, plump, calm and resilient. i really believe this has greatly improved my skin barrier and overall skin health. it does look a little white when first applied, but that completely disappears as it absorbs. i am super happy with how my skin looks and feels right now!",positive
"i did not enjoy the sample i received at all. it did not spread evenly because it dried out too fast to even do so. i had to use so much for a small area for it to work, and plus it was sticky.",negative
"good product, i purchased to help with uneven textured and dull skin.",positive
"the face feels refreshing but it is a poor makeup cleanser. my toner catches the leftover foundation on my face! and there is a lot. i have such stubborn blackheads due to using this! if this cannot clean majority of foundation, how deep do you think it will clean your face, your pores? the ingredient listed gives you a cooling, refreshing sensation but sensation is not cleansing.",negative
"i wanted to love this, but the scent is too strong for my face. it is good as a handleg cream though.",positive
"hands down the best cleanser out there! i have combination skin. it works best if you remove most of the makeup first, then cleanse the face. this tube last for a while",positive
"i originally got this as a rewards bazaar product and found that it was one of the few face creams that i could use with my prescription grade retinol. i have very sensitive, dry, fair, freckled skin and just got really lucky with this one. i bought one because the little one worked out so well.",positive
"but i like it lots anyways. i keep it in the fridge so it is nice and cool for a little pick me up. but really this is just cute packaging, a nice fine mister, and a light watermelon-scented fog on your face. my skin does not feel any different after using this. i wish it did more, but i still enjoy the experience.",neutral
"i add drops to my face before the wild rose facial and it makes my skin baby soft and smooth the next day! i also put bunch of oils rosehip,arganbefore putting this on but this absorbs the quickest among them!totally recommend!",positive
okay so hyram made me buy this and as i am finishing my first bottle i feel that it is incredibly overhyped and it is a very good but very standard foaming gel cleanser i am sorry but it had to be said,negative
after using this product for a few days it broke me out soo terribly with like painful pimples something i never deal with on the regular!,negative
"the product is great. however, the container needs to be changed. i only had this sunscreen for a few weeks and the finish came off on my fingers. i put up with it for awhile because i liked the product. however, i ended up taking it back. if tatcha improves the container, i would purchase again.",negative
"i used beauty points to try this, i am so glad i did not pay for it. it is extremely drying and stripping. no idea what origins thinks gently means, but this was anything but gentle. i have combination skin that started flaking and peeling after a few days of use. definitely do not buy this if you have dry skin, i cannot image the damage it would cause. i threw it away after a week.",negative
"great product, the alphabeta peel did an amazing job on my face. it felt very soft and looked amazingly smooth",positive
love this product! these are great pads for the perfect glow on your skin,positive
"feels really nice initially, but does not do much long term. my skin is not less dull or less textured and i have gone through the entire bottle. nice temporary hydration, but if you have issues with dryness or generally want more hydrated skin throughout the day, this is not your product. it is nice, but it is not nice. also, the rose petals in there are cute until you start reaching the end of the bottle and they clog the little hole and you can no longer get the product out even though there is plenty left. will not be repurchasing.",neutral
"frankly, i could not tell you anything about this product. i went through the entire bottle and noticed nothing. did not do anything negative, but not really sure it was helping either. might be more of a long game, but not worth it in my opinion.",neutral
"good at removing makeup but it does not emulsify at all. when you try and wash it off with warm water you are left so extremely oily. paired with my usual face wash my skin did look nice and feel nice afterwards. this would be soooo much better if it actually emulsified so that way your follow up cleanser was not just washing this off and could help further clean your skin. this is ok for the size and price, but they need some good emulsifying ingredients to make this light years better. i do not really like when a cleanser is leaving a thick greasy layer in my skin.",neutral
"good night cream to use at night that is not to thick or too thin. unfortunately, i will not be repurchasing this product again since it has a really strong scent that does not go away. i will be using it up only because it is a pricy item.",neutral
"i was gifted by peter thonas roth clinical skincarei love this product because of the ingredients it has. intensive wrinkle treatment is formulated with granactive retinoid vitamin a, which works to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. cosmin c, a cutting-edge form of vitamin c, has a skin-friendly bio-she will for increased potency, helping to diminish and brighten the look of uneven tone. vitamin e moisturizes, nourishes and helps soothe the look of skini have smile lines and it makes me really self conscious. so far it goes on very smooth on my skin i am hoping to see more results in weeks!",positive
"i am usually okay with scented products as i do not have a sensitive skin but this cleanser is so heavily scented that after i wash my face, i can still smell it on my hands. i hate it. also even after double cleansing, this still does not remove eye makeup.",negative
i received a sample size of this product which i used religiously for weeks and loved it. it felt wonderful on my skin! after enjoying the sample size i bought a full size. it is awful! has made me break out and stings my eyes. i do not understand why there is such a negative difference! so bummed.,negative
"i have been using this moisturizer from a sample set for about a month and i have to say i really really love this moisturizer. my skin looks so much brighter and much more even. under make up, it gives this beautiful glow. i had been using cerave everything for the last months due to my dermatologists recommendations but also from doing research online but this moisturizer has really taken my skin to another level. they always say you do not need anything fancy so this should not be so good but it is, i am really shocked by the results. i feel much more confident without make up and the reason is this product. highly recommend. p.s. i have sensitive skin.",positive
"i have used this sunscreen for about a week now and can see this being fantastic for those with dry skin. as someone with oily sensitive skin, this has made it worse. i feel greasy and shiny the whole day and have noticed small pimples starting to form. it does not leave a white cast and it does feel lightweight so it is not entirely terrible. pretty low cost was a bonus, so i was hoping this would work out but it just was not meant to be for me.",neutral
i have been using this for years. i have tried to change my routine and use different toners but i inevitably end up breaking out. i always.come back to this toner and it returns my skin to normal in a mater of days. i use this morning and night along with the clinique face soap for acne.,positive
"this has a great formula and does not leave a white cast. it did not because my skincare products to pill and i like that it is silicone free. unfortunately, the finish is so greasy and shiny i find it unpleasant to wear. i have combination skin. maybe this is better suited to dry skin. the search for my hg clean mineral sunscreen continues.",neutral
"i was a bit apprehensive about luxury brand as i have experienced quite a few misses that did not match the price tag-- but this and its other counterparts-- are worth it! they are a wonderful addition to any routine because being boosters, they are meant to be added to your regular beauty items, to supplement and enhance. love them all, most especially the glow booster! and they are beautifully packaged, worth displaying!",positive
why does it contain bergamot oil? it contains bergapten which is a phototoxin. you should never put it on your skin in daylight. it could cause irritation or damage to your skin. this is so irresponsible!,negative
it does not neutralize redness. it works the same as a regular foundation.,negative
so greasy. the fragrance is so unnecessary and it seemed to make my acne worse,negative
i received this serum as a gift and have been using it for more than weeks now. i like the texture of the cream. it is not too thick and absorbs very quickly. my skin feels smooth and hydrated the morning after. highly recommend,positive
"i am a de die hard, but this product is one of my least favorites in the entire line. i have dry skin and this left me feeling tight and broke me out. now it is the most expensive hand soap i have ever owned.",negative
"meh. it smells wonderful and looks pretty, but when you get to less than half the bottle, it starts to look muddy. i cannot tell that it actually helped my skin at all. i threw the bottle out before i finished it.",negative
"smells good, however, oily skin does not need any more oil product.",neutral
"i am a sunscreen junkie and a holistic skin coach. despite not being thrilled with the ingredient deck, i used this as a primer. it looked like a mess on me. i am not understanding the appeal. i never return products but instead give them away. this is being returned.",negative
ok so let me first say that there are things i love about this cleanser. it makes my skin feel great and clean and has helped keep it clear. but there are things i do not love...the cleanser is scrubby but it is too scrubby to use in my eye area and not scrubby enough to get a good scrub on my face which i need. so i always still feel like i need to exfoliate. the cleanser is also quite expensive which makes me not rush to restock if i am not living for it. i will also admit i wish the mini bottle was refillable for trips but that is neither here nor there. i simply do not love it.,neutral
"i do not get what the hype is about this product. maybe it is for mature skin? the formula is gross, it is so sticky and tacky. worst of all, it gave me vile whiteheads all over my forehead. i do not even have sensitive skin. beware!",negative
"absolutely the best overnight product on the market. i model and travel a lot for work and must have my skin looking pretty perfect even after long flights. these are absolute life savers. put it on at night and it sucks all of the yuck right out. it does leave it a little red, but flat, so it is much easier for covering up after some good moisturizer to help the redness heal. i purchased these before going to germany as a last ditch effort to clear up a break out on my jawline. these were a life saver. i love these for every day too, especially if you have monthly hormonal cycstic acne. highly recommend.",positive
"i absolutely adore this product, and i am already on my second bottle! the scent is very refreshing but not too strong, and the toner does not because any irritation to my relatively sensitive skin. after a few weeks of using this toner, i have noticed a drastic difference in my skin. i am unfortunately very acne prone, and my nose and chin area are blackheads galore however, this toner has really helped get rid of them! it also leaves your skin looking and feeling very smooth and soft, it makes me feel very rejuvenated and i am always excited to use it when doing my skincare routine. the packaging is also very simple, but stunning.",positive
"the product overall is not too bad, the consistency reminds me a lot of kiehls facial moisturizer, has very little scent to none at all which is nice! i have combo skin and in the short time i was using it, it did tend to leave me greasy even with the thinnest of layers i could do.",neutral
"this stinks! i do not know if mine went bad, but it has a horrible smell! its also so thick! you really have to work it in. i love most of their products, but this is a pass in future",neutral
"just bought this. was recommended to me by sephora as a scrub but i read the reviews and saw people were saying it was more of a cleanser. i still wanted to try it because i was out of my face wash and the price is not bad. it lathers really well and gets my makeup off. however, i honestly just cannot stand the smell. it smells like oranges but not the fresh kind, the fake candy kind of orange smell. gives me a headache.",neutral
i wanted to love this... but i do not. it made my problem area worse and i started getting whiteheads. i will say it dries nicely on the skin and feels soft... and i am glad i only spent on it so i do not feel bad for replacing it with something that will actually do the job.,negative
"i love youth to the people as a brand and i use other products of theirs. i wanted to love this spray but unfortunately i cannot. it makes my cheeks feel like they are stinging every time i use it, and it makes my redness worse instead of better. the negative effects are not horrible but they do not make for a nice experience either. i am sad because it sounded so great. i left on one star because the mist is so fine and does feel luxurious at first, and i think this might work for people who do not have skin sensitivities.",negative
"i tried this product as a sample after running out of my sunday riley product. i honestly cannot even review how well it works because it smells so bad, i had to stop using it. not sure if anyone else experienced the same thing but i could not take it.",negative
i have no complaints so far. a little goes a long way so the product will last me a good while. so far i have only been using it on my t-zone but i have see improvements as far as acne goes. i have only used it a few times and want to use it a few more before using it on my whole face. no breakouts though which is a plus for me. undetermined if i would buy again or not.,positive
"really enjoy the feel of the eye cream applicator tip on this. the cooling sensation is more from that than the formula i feel, but still all around great. definitely is moisturizing and gentle on the skin. great eye cream option for those looking for something unique.",positive
"it is sticky, does not moisturize and honestly does not do anything but sit on top of your skin. my skin gets irritated after using it, and i have not noticed any benefits regarding dark spots even though i had been using it for around months. important it also contains so many different types of alcohol, all of which are bad for the skin and dry it out even more. this causes premature wrinkles, clogged pores, patchy skin and even permanent damage after long term use.",negative
"this product has a very very strong scent to it and although it is a nice scent, i do not like applying fragrance on my skin. after a few days of applying this my skin reacted and broke out so i stopped applying. the price is a little much and i will not be buying this on my own.",negative
"after using this product continuously for months i can honestly say the results are so worth the price tag. i have tried everything from drunk elephant to sunday riley to dr. dennis gross. the liquid consistency is great for mixing with other creams day or night and it absorbs quickly. at first i was annoyed with the packaging, however, it keeps the product stabilized and free from bacteria. i do wish there was a way to see inside the container when it is almost out. it is kind of annoying to keep track of how many pumps i have used before needing to reorder. as usual the tatcha packaging is beautiful and such a treat to experience. i have seen massive reductions in fine lines and overall brightness of my skin. if you do not play on using it consistently do not bother! the key is consistency people! i will definitely continue trading my coins for this product.",positive
"extremely drying and irritating. it even made my skin itchy and i am not sensitive at all usually. avoid, i cannot believe all these other reviews are real.",negative
"bought this hoping it would at least be similar to drunk elephants protini moisturizer but unfortunately the consistency and feel on the skin is different. it is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that sinks in right away but just did not wow me like protini did. cannot say too much about the anti-aging effects as i am only and have only been using for about a week now.",neutral
i honestly do not believe it does anything. i used it twice daily until the bottle was done.,neutral
super moisturizing and it even helped with my psoriasis.,positive
"it did give a nice dewy look on my face and did moisturize better then an avergae moisturizer. however, i did not like the smell and i do not understand the need for the frangrance in the product. if they did not put fragrance in the product it would smell better and not be so irritating to very senstive skin types. i am very sensative and i did notice some irriation on my skin shortly after applying",neutral
"i really wish i had liked this more. i absolutely hated the scent, but it does fade quickly. it is non-greasy and does its job well. the tube looks nice but the large hole makes it hard to dispense the amount of product you want- accidentally ending up with a big glob is not a big deal in general, but i really do not want to waste sunscreen that is over. overall, it is fine but does not really seem to have advantages over products that are half the price.",neutral
"really enjoy this product. use it with squalane oil. i like to leave it on for maybe min then rinse. my face and pores feel cleaner, clearer, tighter, and smoother.",positive
"i do not think this is worth the price, i did receive this for free to test out and i am so thankful for that. but it is really nothing special unfortunately, it does have a nice even mist but it smells so gross and does not leave my skin feeling refreshed or hydrated at all! it actually feels tight after i give myself a couple spritz on clean dry skin before applying my moisturizer. i would not pay for this",neutral
really good mixture of acids. best to use once a week for people new to using acids on the face before increasing usage,neutral
"i have clear skin but i am acne prone to things. this made my skin break out. i thought it was normal at first because it was a new product but each day i started breaking out in new spots. it also is not as hydrating, so definitely for the summer. a good thing about this product is it is definitely cooling to the skin.",negative
"after hearing about this product from several influencers i follow, i purchased during the vib sale. unfortunately, this did not work for me, and i did not see much of a difference in puffiness. if you like a cooling effect, but want a cheaper product, i would go with ole henrikson cold plunge mask.",negative
this broke me out terribly. a sephora employee recommended it to me after seeing me at my usual products. i have sensitive skin anyway and this really did not help at all. neither did the vitamin c serum they recommended. felt nice with first application at least.,negative

"this is one of the best face exfoliating scrubs i have used in a long time! i read reviews about the sample size i got being too small but after using it i realized a little goes a long way! the scrub has tiny grains in it rather than the large ones most exfoliants have. after using it, it leaves my face baby soft and am currently using it once a week. i would highly recommend this product!",positive
i have very sensitive problem skin. history of bad acne and still have a few problems. everything either causes a reaction or a breakout but not this cream. i only buy this now and am thrilled to have found it,positive
"i am excited to use this cleanser coz i heard a lot of good things about it.. on the first time using it, i immediately wash it of coz it feels like burning my cheeks and it makes my cheeks red.. it doest feel like a sting but it really feels like burning.. next day i tried to use the cleanser again and again it feels burning again.. the next day i decided to skip it, the next day again i tried to use it again and my whole face feels burning.. i decided to stop using this cleanser.. my whole face kind of feels like raw for week and i cannot use and i did not apply anything on my face that time coz it hurts that much even moisturizer.. it did not work for me but it does not mean this will not work for you too.. it is just this is not for me..",neutral
"was excited and grateful to receive a sample of this in my latest order and had high hopes since i have heard a lot of buzz about glow recipe in general. unfortunately the texture is too sticky for my liking and does not feel like the tacky-ness ever goes down. the same glowy effect can be achieved much more affordably by using any moisturizing serum or lotion or a facial oil. the fragrance is pleasant, but i would not spend this type of money on a product that has fragrance in it as this ingredient can cause skin irritation, breakouts, and possibility of developing allergy to fragrance in skin care products down the line.",negative
"i genuinely enjoyed the hydration. my skin felt supple and soft after using with my existing skincare routine. i absolutely could not get over the smell however.maybe fermented skincare just is not for me, but it lingered all day and i could not get past it. if you are not sensitive to scent, this product is great and i definitely recommend. i received this product free in exchange for an honest review.",neutral
"i received a sample of this in my most recent sephora order. i was excited to try it because i have sensitive skin and i like most de products. it felt fine as i applied it but the next morning my face started to peel. it was a little section near my mouth. then my cheeks followed suit. for almost a week my face was irritated and red. it was very uncomfortable and inconvenient. however, after it calmed down my face felt awesome. i am chalking it up to my sensitive skin, this product was just too much for it.",negative
"omg, i totally love this product, the texture is perfect and the smell so natural and good! we can see the difference in one use! thank you so much caudalie for this great product!",positive
the product is good but not what everyone hypes it up to be elfs sleeping mask is just as good if not better for a fraction of the price. all in all i would say it is worth the money if you have extra to spend because it does give luxury but is not a staple and if you cannot spend the money do not.,neutral
i absolutely love this serum gives your skin such a beautiful glow,positive
"really wanted to love this. the ingredients are perfect and it feels wonderfully moisturizing and nourishing, no stinging, no white cast. unfortunately when i moved to a hot humid climate in the summer, this just looks crazy shiny and greasy. i cannot even control it with mattifying powder, my forehead looks like an oil slick. i will keep it and hopefully it will still work ok in the winter time, but i am looking for something more matte to use in the summer time.",neutral
"i was hesitant to try this product as i do not tend to switch my skin care routine up but this toner is amazing! right away, my skin was shinier and smoother. i will continue to use this twice daily and i am so excited to see the results in a month.",positive
"i was really excited to try this product. while i do not have large pores, i am in my early s and have benefited from the brightening and exfoliating effects of other products containing aha. while a appreciate the idea of this product as being made with natural ingredients and infused with rose quartz, etc, i found the scent to be unpleasant and too heavy. i did not care for the thickness of the product and after over a week of continued nightly usage, it just did not perform as well for me as other aha products that i have used. my skin was mildly brighter but still over all just dull. i wanted to love it but it just fell a little flat for me, especially when other products leave me with glowing, fresh looking skin.",negative
"i selected a sample of this product because i have used other products in the line and love them. unfortunately the second i opened the tube i was hit with a smell that can only be described as bathtub cleaner. i am sure the product probably helped my skin but i really, really do not want to smell like bathroom spray. my husband was quite shocked when i asked him to smell my face.",negative
"it is okay, not great. it is a little hard to take off. i have noticed the swelling goes down but i think it actually makes the zits even more ready to pop. not sure if i would recommend",neutral
this literally does not do anything. it smells good though and packaging is cute.,negative
"this product is easy to use and causes no irritation on my sensitive skin. it is easy to wash off as well. however, i did not see a huge change in the fine lines under my eyes. maybe with prolonged use, i will see more.",neutral
"i love this, it really give me a glowing face like james welsh for days. i did not need to use face masks that only works for a couple of hours. just make sure you do not overuse it. i only applied once a week at night.",positive
wish they did not change the formula. the new formula has peptides which does not work for people with dry skin. this caused me dry patches. i used the old formula for years and it was amazing. bring back the old formula!,negative
"this product works well and does not smell as potent as some other vitamin c products on the market. it also helps that this is an all natural brand. however, for the price, there is tons of other options out there. ended up returning this for a much cheaper version by derma e which works really well.",neutral
"the cream itself is very thick and moisturizing. it would be a good product for someone with dry skin. unfortunately, the pump did not work on the sample i received and no lotion is dispensed when i press down. i have used other products in similar style dispensers without issue, so i amcertain the problem was with this particular dispenser and not simply the style. to try the cream, i had to unscrew the packaging which was slightly annoying. i expect a product to dispense easily at this price point and offer a pleasant user experience. this product did not achieve that, but at least the cream itself is nice.",neutral
works okay... i think it is cheaper to buy a version on amazon that comes with a ton more dots with a variety of sizes- does the same job as this does.,neutral
"i purchased the serum after liking but not loving the so is daily rescue facial spray and i like this better, but i am still not in love. i do not really think the product lives up to its claims and i have not noticed a difference at all. unfortunately, you need a good two or three pumps it cover your entire face so you can go through a bottle pretty quickly. unlike other serums, i have to apply this directly to my face rather than my hands because it soaks up so fast. i also do not love that it does not tell you the concentration of hypochlorous acid. will not order again.",neutral
i am really like this cream. for my combination skin i use it at night and it is moisturizes very well. in the morning my skin looks so fresh. it do not me breakouts and do not clogged my pores.,positive
"i received this product from influenster in partership with dr. jart for free for my honest review. well let me tell you, this will be my new go to product. not oily, sits very well on the skin, hides my rosacea flares up and gives the comfort of added sunscreen. color match was great. i have been able to wear this all day long and not look streaky or like it is fading off after wearing it. it also has improved my skin with its added benefits. it has definitely helped my rosacea.",positive
"i bought this because i wanted a more natural night cream with antioxidants. it has a rich, whipped consistency- a little goes a long way. i layer it over serums, and if you do not give other products time to sink in, this cream will pill which i have never experienced before- bleck!. also, though i do have sensitive skin, i find it stings a bit- not sure if this is proof of its potency? once i navigated these little quirks, i grew used to it and was pleased to wake up with a glowy, non-greasy morning face. my biggest buggaboo, though, is that i found it to reaaally fragranced! and it is not an earthy, subtle boscia scent. we are talking borderline bath",neutral
i love it but i found a hair or something in it. the first time i thought it was mine or my boyfriends did not think much of it but this morning i squeezed it out it was in the moisturizer...,neutral
"not really worth it, after using it started to dry and sting the skin around my mouth and cheeks and activated rosacea also, be careful if you are allergic to fragrances since it does have a strong fragrance. at that price point and all the hype i was expecting much better results.",negative
"was really hoping this would be a miracle worker for my long standing hormonal breakouts. unfortunately, this has not been the case. it cleans and removes my make up just fine but getting rid of my break outs, it has yet to do so after weeks of continuous use at night before bed and a gentle facial cleanser in the morning.",neutral
is good for sensitive skin. it smells good. but it does not last much...,neutral
"immediately fell in love with this eye cream. i am constantly on the hunt for something that will make my eye area appear more awake and energized and this is it! the formula is a little thick, but adds a plumpness to the undereye that is so hydrating. never tried de before, but so impressed!",positive
"great moisturizer, probably one of the best i have ever tried. super moisturizing and feels so clean. the problem is the packaging. i get that the dispensing method is supposed to keep the lotion clean because you do not have to dig your fingers into a jar but a simple pump would do the trick. as it is, you squirt some out and then have to smear it off with your finger which leave residue behind that accumulates over time. pretty gross.",negative
"so i was super obsessed with this at first. i love the scent and i love the texture. i soon noticed that it was a terrible serum to layer with. if i use this on a clean, dry face it would probably be fine. but something about layering it over and under other products my skincare regimen is longthat makes my face pill. the last few times i used this, i started applying my foundation and realized it was too gross to continue, i had layers of product or dead skin rolling around under my makeup, so i had to wash it all off and go simpler. i do not know if it is the combo of ingredients or what, but it is a super disappointment. i am glad i received this for testing purposes, gave me an honest shot at my opinion.",neutral
"i love the b oil! i put this on before i go to sleep and wake up to soft hydrated skin. it gives that extra hydration, i sometimes also mix a little of it in with my moisturizer. this is so affordable and would recommend!",positive
"i am only a few days in so i do not expect a miracle with my dark spots going away but i may have to stop using this produce sooner for the strong, fragrant smell. leaves me skin feeling great but the smell is a bit overwhelming.",neutral
made my eyes tear like crazy. did not see any positive effects from this.,negative
"the texture is magic. it feels nice on and sets makeup well. however, i think it is a bit misguided to call it a skin perfector as i thought it would help texture and moisture. it is okay, but i think you can get better for cheaper. i received this product as a free sample.",neutral
very hydrating. i have dry combo skin and this is perfect. melts into my skin. the spoon is great and hygienic. i have purchased this several times and plan to keep it in stock at all times.,positive
"i have insanely dry skin and this primer hydrates my skin and helps create a smooth base for my makeup. it also helps me get a bit of a glowy look under my foundation, which i prefer. this with a setting spray helped my foundation stay on all day in degrees through a photoshoot day!",positive
wanted to love this! while it did reduce my redness it was super drying and cakey. looked like i had bad foundation on,negative
this oil smells so bad like a field of grass on your face. that and i am not noticing much of a difference in my skin.,neutral
"this winter, my face became extremely dry and flakey yuck. this product was recommended to me and it worked wonders! not even half way through the bottle and my face has improved tremendously. i feel moisturized throughout the whole day.",positive
holy grail! it is extremely watery! like exactly like water! put a few drops in your hands first and then pat it in before you put anything else on! it will leave your skin so plump and hydrated that a lot of the times i only use this and i am good all day.,positive
"this product is so horrible, it says it is for oily skin but it just accentuates it more and adds more if a greasy look. it does not absorb into my skin, it just sits on top",negative
"i bought this full size after receiving a sample. i love the way this removes my makeup. i use a lot of glitter in my eye makeup, and out of all the makeup removers i have used, this one gets the most of it off and leaves the least behind. i love how soft and smooth it leaves my skin.",positive
"i had high hopes for this product based on all of the positive reviews, but was very let down! i followed the instructions, exfoliating beforehand and moisturizing properly, then blending with a mitt during application. the best part of this tanner, for me, was that the color--it was very similar to my natural tan, so it did not look too fake. however, the rest of the experience has been a nightmare! the first and most noticeable problem is that it settled into all of my pores and now i look like i have blackheads all over my body! i have tried scrubbing the areas with everything from various makeup removers, acetone, shower gel, and dish soap, and it will not come off at all! it also is not very dark for a medium shade it looks like i was only in the sun for maybe a day. the smell is very strong and is still lingering on my skin and in the bathroom, which is annoying for a product that claims to be scentless. also, as others have mentioned, it is hard to see which areas you have properly covered, since it is colorless when applied, which can lead to some interesting splotches if you are not careful. i even scrubbed my hands and feet with soap after application, as is recommended, and it still developed on these areas. now all i can do is wait and see how long it takes to fade.",negative
"after a couple of weeks using this nightly, i found that it consistently makes my eyes burn and water up, and i have to use artificial tears to make the stinging stop. i did not find this eye cream to be particularly firming, but it was hydrating. i will use this jar up, but i will not be buying this product again. it is not great for my sensitive skin and eyes.",negative
"i should start off by saying that i am a olehenrikson fan. i have been using their truth c for almost years. i was intrigued by this because of this one being for the next age bracket with me approaching- thought i would give it a whirl. it is been over days i finally just stopped using it. i am super disappointed. from the packaging- no turn stop, so every day you have a little chunk that comes out which is wasteful annoying- to the formula. maybe it is my skin but this stuff did not absorb. it just sat on my skin felt a bit tacky. i tried to give it enough time to get used to it but honestly after a month my skin was looking not great. more pimples larger pores. so maybe it is my skin type but it did not work for me. going back to truth c. chalking this one up for a learning experience.",negative
"i have sensitiveacne pronecombination skin. this cleanser did not help nor make my skin worse. i was honestly hoping for some change, since the cleanser was highly reviewed on youtube. i have also lost a lot of the product due to the packaging constantly leaking. overall not really satisfied. bummer.",neutral

"giving this stars because i like thick moisturizers and it was good at first. i am on day of this product and my skin has started to break out in tiny bumps and a rash. i always research products before use and have only had a reaction to one product before so it is unusual for me to react. after further research, i foind that glossiers website stated it had a. star rating. buried under the star reviews is a lot of star reviews saying the exact same thing about a random skin reaction after using it for a short while.i would definitely approach with caution.",negative

"yes, this is the best neck cream! i have had lines on my neck since i can remember and i have been using this cream for weeks. it is smoothing all the texture on my neck. i still have a long way to go but i can see improvements so far. it has a heavy consistency but absorbs quickly. now this is my favorite step on my skincare routine. it also leaves my decollete very hydrated, soft and with a radiance finish. the only thing that i would like to change is the jar packaging. that is why i will stick to the oz size in order to finish it quickly.",positive
i have used this for a week and definitely seen results for my pores. i usually apply it before go to bed. it is little oily but it is so far so good. i have used many creams and this has given me faster results. only downfall is the price but i would still recommend. this is gifted by la mer,positive
"i have been using this cream exclusively for years and have bought well over jars to use everyday. with my most recent purchase, i realized that the jar had changed along with the title that used to be lotus youth preserve with super complex. did not think much of it, until i started using my new jar. i even tried one of my old bottles that i kept at my boyfriends. the difference is significant, especially when you have dry skin. the formula has changed to not be as moisturizing as before and does not leave skin feeling refreshed or plump. i have to apply twice just to get the same moisturizing effect as before. very disappointed in this sneaky change from fresh. this product used to feel luxurious but now it feels like any other drugstore moisturizer with high price tag. will not buy again.",negative
love this product. i like that i get color correcting sun protection in one! a little goes a long way. perfect for summer- add a tiny bit of concealer in spots if needed and away you go. this is a staple in my routine now.,positive

"this is a great spot treatment, especially for cystic acne! it can be pretty drying, so i only use it on emerging spots, while i use the clinique acne solutions clarifying lotion all over to prevent cystic acne. this spot treatment is the only product i have found so far that effectively reduces spots without major irritation that is not a prescription cream. a little also goes a long way.",positive
"what is the fuss about this product..? i decided to try it because everybody was swearing about it. the only pro i found with this cleansing balm is the hydration my skin feels after washing it off. it does not remove eye make up at all..! i had to use a second product to remove the eyeshadow, mascara and eyeliner and then proceeded with my cleanser. i am dissapointed..!! anyway, this product can be used in different ways, so i will try it as a facial mask for hydration purposes so i do not feel that i wasted my money on this one. i will stick to my clinique and hada labo cleanser oils as a first step in my skin care routine to remove the make up.",neutral
"i did not love this product. i was excited to try it, but i did not notice any improvement in my skin. i had no skin issues prior to using this product, but after about a month i realized i had more texture, bumps, and dry skin than when i was using my sk-ii routine. i do not reach for this product anymore, and it just sits in my skincare arsenal.",neutral

done deal! just buy it! it keeps my skin smooth and prevents me from getting acne. i use it every night before bed and it is gentle enough that it will not dry out your skin! so worth it i already have a back up bottle ready to go! i also like the nozzle it comes with to dispense the toner!,positive
smells nice but can be a little drying. i do not use daily.,neutral
"i have combination, acne-prone skin that gets oily during the summer, so i bought this to help reduce oil and keep my pores clear. unfortunately, this caused me to break out both times that i used it. when i checked the ingredients on inci decoder, i found the mask has a number of comedogenic ingredients! this might be a good mask for people who rarely break out, but that is not how it is advertised.",negative
"this is seriously the greatest moisturizer. it goes on smooth, like you are putting cashmere on your face and spreads really well. i put it on after a couple drops of pure squalane oil and the two mesh wonderfully. i do have ever-so-slightly dry spots and oily skin, and this does the trick. it somehow evens the texture of my skin so no more dry spots or flakes, and no lotion clumping either. it does not have a scent as far as i can tell, and i appreciate that as my nose is very sensitive and certain strong scents can make my asthma act up. i also really love their campaign to put an end to student debt hearts i want to see that sort of thing on more products, especially more of the luxury brands. overall, this is my new go-to. if i had any request it is that they made a giant value size for the entire body.",positive

"i would only recommend you try this if you have dry skin. i have oily skin but felt i may have been to harsh on my moister barrier so i decided to try this, which for me personally was a bad move. i suffer from hormonal acne so i break out around my you zone but never anywhere else. i believe this lotion is the reason for the small whiteheads on my forehead- the place i am least likely to ever get acne. this lotion leaves an invisible layer over my face the oils in it, and by afternoon i am g r e a s y. all in all, i myself will be returning this tomorrow and never repurchasing but if you have dry and damaged skin, i would bet this is for you. it has clean ingredients and does not contain dimethicone. the price point is pretty reasonable and comparable to most other moisterizers at sephora. it really only takes pumps to get your whole face, neck, and decolletage. because its a pump bottle and not a pot, its more sanitary and less likely to become a jar of bacteria and nastiness. it would probably last about months with am and pm use.the short of it do not get it if you are oily andor acne prone. do get it if you have dry andor damaged skin.",neutral
"finally, a supergoop product that is affordable. it is sticky to the touch once on your face and it does not really absorb better for protecting against the sun i am going to. but i do not mind the stickiness because it smells great, leaves zero residue, does not burn my eyes, gives a great glow, and smells amazing.i do have normal skin though, so i would not recommend for anyone with oily skin.",positive
"this product seems to be a favorite, but i think i am missing something. i have combinational skin, and find that this thick formula over a moisturizer makes my skin greasy which i am not a fan of. additionally, it does not do much for my skin tone. i do not have too much redness, but i am still underwhelmed at the results. biggest pro is probably the spf for me!",neutral

"my friend and i must be the outliers here- because we both tried this and had less than stellar results. i have oily acne prone skin and she has dry skin with no acne. for me, it made my skin feel much oilier and actually clogged my pores- and my skin is very used to using acids. it has no significant effect on existing blemishes. generally speaking though, i cannot use products with many oils like in this product. for her she said she did notice a bit of clearer skin, but very time she used it her skin ended up extremely dry and she had to over-hydrate for the next week. we both incorporated this product very slowly, and felt it simply was not the right product for us. i feel this product is going to be best for normal skin without any dehydration with minor texturepigmentation issues.",negative

"really great product! does what it says. overall the brand is quite amazing as well. all of their products are cruelty free and all of their boxes are recyclable. only reason i took star off is because although the packaging is recycle, the packets of them inside the box i am pretty sure is not. plus you do not really need that big of a packet for a small strip that has dots on it. you also could put both strips in the same packet. the box itself could have been a smaller box. great product but packaging could be more sustainable",positive

"licensed esthetician here! i am always on the fence about products from the ordinary, to be honest. of course i think the price is really great and affordable for a lot of people, but that does not always mean the product is worth it. i have dark spots and texture and i found that this really did nothing for my skin.",negative
good powder exfoliant and lasts a long time- this product really smalls bad to me.. it is smells like baby formula.,negative

"i bought this as my first retinol because the formulation is pretty gentle. i use it at night with a niacinamide serum. while i cannot yet speak to the effectiveness of the retinol, it did not break me out or because any dryness or irritation. i do wear sunscreen daily and alternate between this and a chemical exfoliator. i am not a huge fan of the smell, but it is not intolerable. it kind of reminds me of stale sweet tea. i will probably opt for a more potent formula once i finish this product but i think it is a great starter retinol.",positive
"this cleanser is amazing! the scent is light and refreshing, not overpowering or cloying whatsoever. a little bit of this cleanser goes a long way as well. the texture when mixed with water is nice and creamy and left my skin feeling clean without being stripped or tight.",positive
"i have not seen the dark spot diminishing effects that i would hoped for and i have used the product for two months now. i have, however, seen it drastically reduce the number of breakouts i experienced in the areas where i have applied it. i suppose it is preventing new dark spots from forming by preventing the acne. i just wish it would address my present dark spot problems. i cannot say the product is a no-go but it has not done what i bought it for specifically.",neutral
"this product did help with my dry skin, but it also felt like wearing sunscreen. i love the fact that it did make my face feel like mochi skin, but there was not any other significant improvements to note.",neutral
"used this as a body oil and it does not absorb into the skin, it sits in the surface of your skin until it transfers to your clothes, bedsheets, bath towels, etc. as mentioned in other reviews, there is nothing wrong with this product, being squalane, but it was not what i was looking for.",negative
clogged my pores and gave me whiteheads on my forehead,negative
not the best for dry or sensitive skin. felt stripping and did not enjoy the fragrance. for the price there is better out there.,neutral
did not work for me at all and if anything it left my skin worse. i have adult acne that came out of nowhere in my s. i had tried many things but this left my oily skin even more oily and i ended up with more breakouts.,negative
"my initial reaction to the product was that it left a nice cooling sensation on my skin as well as leaving a matte finish while still being moisturized. after a bit ish minutes my face started to feel a bit hot and stingy but there was no redsight of an actual reaction so i left it. the next morning my skin looked nice but did not feel any different than it did before. i proceeded to use the product for a week and saw no difference in my pores and i felt that it made my skin a bit drier feeling than usual. the only thing that i liked was the healthy glow it gave me, although i can find that in other moisturizers that also have other benefits to my skin.",neutral
"it is a decent toner but it did not feel hydrating or moisturizing on my combooily skin in an area with around humidity. it is an unscented, milky, minimally tacky, and lightweight watery toner that dries quickly and thankfully does not break me out. i put drops into my hand and pat onto my damp face after cleansing, then proceed with the rest of my skincare routine. i have also tried layering this product-x on my skin and yet it does not make my skin feel more hydratedmoisturized.i really wished that it worked for my skin since this is a rare fragrance-free product from this brand, but instead it was a teensy bit drying on my skin, especially around my eye area, even when i avoid applying the toner around my eyes. at least it was not irritating or as drying as the yttp adapt,ogen mist that i have tried before. sadly, this had to go back since my eyes were not feeling comfortable heavy pressure feeling at all once i started using this, and once i stopped using it, my eyes felt much better.the packaging is a sturdy, frosted plastic that dispenses by drops. i have attached a photo of the product.",neutral
i do not get the hype. are these other reviews fake? was a gift and did not like it. smells funny. feels greasy. gross.,negative
the how to use section says to use this daily but i would not! i learned that rosehip oil is supposed to be used every other to every two days. after four nights of continual usage my face broke out horribly! be careful.,neutral
absolutely love this! i have oily skin and this goes well with it! it almost covers my pores and looks great under makeup!,positive
"this. serum. is. the. best! over the years, i have tried many different vitamin c serums sunday riley, the ordinary, ole henriksen, and more but never stuck with any because they were either a bit tacky, made me break out, or both. this serum is a game changer. the texture is almost like water, so there is almost no stickiness. i have noticed zero breakouts. and the glow is instant!! never thought i would feel like this about a vitamin c product, but here we are-- i am officially tatchas fan. recommend!",positive
"this is hands down the best self-tanner i have tried. other than the usual self-tanner smell you cannot avoid, the color is beautiful as long as you actually apply it correctly. you add the drops to your lotion per section of your body you are working on and apply in a circular motion to avoid this streaking some speak of. i have insane amounts of scarring and i bruise really easy which is why i use this- to cover it up. i am fair but olive and drops per section of skin is perfectly natural looking. i am going to try out the dark to see how it works. no, i do not put this on my face because i am acne prone. i have also noticed the lotion i use makes a huge difference in how the color pays off. the neccessaire body lotion works the best. the sol de j natural lotion is far too thick that it takes forever for it to sink into the skin and i do not feel the color looks as good. just play around. do not give up too soon!",positive
"i was not sure at first if it was the cleanser that dried my skin, but recently i switched cleanser and my skin is back to normal. i guess if you have sensitive skin like i do, it might be too strong. otherwise, it felt really great on my skin the first few times, i am still keeping it and will try again this summer when my skin is much oilier.",neutral
"when i got this product, i was a bit apprehensive about the volcanic pumice. i tested it on the back of my hand, and it felt very abrasive and textured. i applied this product all over my face, and gently massaged it into my skin. i washed it off quickly with warm water, and patted dry, and followed up with my skincare routine. the next morning, i did wake up with pleasantly glowing skin.i washed it off quickly because the cream did stain my fingers orange when i tested the product. i was worried about staining my face. the product instructions suggest to leave it on for about- minutes for a detox, but i would not recommend it because of the possible staining.i removed stars because of the orange staining, and for the abrasiveness of the exfoliant. the product itself is beautiful, and left my skin lovely and glowy the next morning. i will continue to use the product sparingly, as the exfoliant is a bit much.please do not over-exfoliate, and be gentle when utilizing this product!!",neutral
i love this serum. i have been using this every morning and night for days and it works wonderfully. it has a bit of an oily feel but that is perfect for me as i have super dry skin. i really think this serum has helped with my skins overall hydration. i have not been wearing makeup as often lately so it has been great as it gives a sheen to my face that lasts a few hours. it is an amazing serum and i would totally repurchase this.,positive
was too thin for my liking it would just slip out of the palm of your hands while rubbing on your face to the point where you did not even get a chance to rub off the makeup. feels like oil that got diluted with water. had to wash my face twice with this oil to remove a decent amount of makeup. for the price you pay you do not get many uses out of it before it runs out. i will stick with using farmacy.,negative
i have hormonal acne and splurged on this. i love dr. sturms videos and was excited to try her products. this cleanser was not strong enough to address acne or to remove makeup as it is suggested to do. i paired it with the scrub twice a week as instructed. probably good if you have good skin already!,negative
"i typically do not enjoy gel cleansers for the small fact that they do not lather or foam well which makes me feel like i am rubbing a mixture of gel and water on my face. this cleanser is different, it lathers and foams so well and does not make my skin feel dry afterwards. i also love the fact that it is apart of sephoras clean line and it is super affordable as well!",positive
"this moisturizer have my face a nice glow and felt like it moisturizer will but it is just way too sticky feeling. it does not seem to sink in and feels like it just sits in top. it also found that everytime i used it, by the end of the day i would have very clogged pores. definitely did not work for me.",negative
meets every expectation a water face mist could have. if you have the correct expectations you will enjoy this product. i use this in between skincare steps because so many products dehydrate your skin if you are skin is dry.,positive
i bought this product a year ago and the bottle is completely empty atm. i had pretty bad acne scarring and i did not find this product super effective. this product is also acidic and pricey. there are definitely better products on the market that are cheaper and more effective shout out to the ordinary.,neutral
"the initial texture and consistency of this eye cream i actually really enjoyed, but i found that it changed andor went bad very quickly. after a few weeks of use, it got very waxy and was very difficult to spread. when this happened, it was pilling under my concealer and was making everything look awful. i did not want to waste product and money, so i switched to using it only at night to finish it up, but it was a very tedious process of trying to work the cream into a more spreadable consistency on my fingertips.",negative
"received a sample then bought the full size because i loved the way it felt on my skin and the glow it gives. however, i personally did not see any long term benefits from the niacinamade and stopped repurchasing because i felt like th wedw other products out there that could give the same result for less",neutral
sadly did not work for me... i have very very sensitive eyes.... so the fragrance bothered my eyes bad... i really wanted to love it but my eyes are just way to sensitive for this product... if your eyes are not sensitive might work for you,negative
"i used up the moisturizer so fast! my skin absolutely loved this and i am already planning on purchasing another jar. it is so moisturizing and feels luxurious. sheseido hardly ever disappoints, but i am certainly impressed. also i feel the price is pretty reasonable considering the quality. i definitely recommend!!",positive
"miracle for cystic acne. i have had no luck in my search for an answer to my painful, large facial cystic acne. i do not get the pimples frequently, but when i do they are bad. i put this spot treatment on overnight and over the course of a couple nights the pimples in question are almost completely gone. typically if left alone, the pimples would take over a week to calm down naturally. agree with the other reviews, the product is tricky to initially put on and i wish the packaging was larger, but the benefits far outweigh these small nitpicks.",positive
this cream was just okay. my face is very dry even in summer and i did not feel like this was moisturizing enough. i also felt that it was a little heavy for the summer heat.,neutral
"this is my new favorite cleanser! the texture is fantastic, as it does not disappear into your skin right away, so you can tell which parts of your face you are actually cleaning. i also enjoy how soft it leaves my skin, and it is very effective at makeup removal, even mascara. highly recommended!",positive
you would be better off rubbing egg whites on your face and letting it dry. absolute junk. returning as soon as possible,negative
"i quite like these and will repurchase. i have dry and sensitive skin and i will start to flake and scab over if i use irritating products. the key for these is just to use them once or twice a week for me. i saw gorgeous results when i used them five days in a row but by the end of it my skin was burnt uppp. but honestly, skin does not need to be exfoliated every day. so once or twice a week, to get a good layer off, is perfect. the step tingles a tiny bit, just a tiny bit. make sure you read the label and wait a few mins in between the wipes! i absolutely love the step wipe, sooo nourishing and makes my skin so happy. i am sooo glad i stopped physical exfoliation and started chemically exfoliating only. what a drastic difference in my skin. much more even oil and hydration levels and significantly reduced redness, irritation, and flaking. these are def worth a shot, but if you are seriously sensitive, i would not use more than x a week.",positive
love this-! i am half asian and my upper eyelids started dropping as i got older i am now and started using this couple of weeks ago twice a day as instructed and wow my upper eyelids are starting to get less droopy puffy. was not expecting that!!! love it! also my crows feet are diminishing. over all great product and will already have recommended this to others.,positive
"it is moisturizing but i did not see a firming effect after i finally used up the whole jar! i hate this eye cream so much because it irritates my eyes so much that made me cried every time i use it, but i was too lazy to bring it back to return it.",negative
"this scrub leaves my skin feeling super smooth! it is very intense, so i would not recommend leaving it on for the full minutes if you have sensitive skin. it leaves my skin red for awhile after, so i would recommend using it well before you need to be somewhere! overall, it is a great exfoliater and i will definitely buy again!",positive
this is one of the beat vitamin c cream i have used! i love sunday riley and this is another holygrail product for me now! love the refreshing scent and it makes my skin brighter and hydrated! would definitely recommend to everyone!,positive
"i was skeptical about hyaluronic acid before... but not anymore! i have only used it for a short time! let me tell you it has made a huge difference with my skin! i typically have super dry spots around my t zone, after using it as part of my usual skin ritual. it is no longer as dry as it was before!! definitely recommend!",positive
really wanted to love this product due to the subtle glow and lightweight and colorless form but caused my skin to breakout all around. my skin does not breakout normally so i had to stop using it.,neutral
really wanted it to work but it made my skin worse! i never break out on my chin and this made my skin awful. so upset.,negative
"i was very excited to try this toner because i love the caudalie face wash. however, to be very honest i do not really see any difference with it and do not really find the product to work. pretty disappointed.",neutral
"this is a very thin product that soaks in to the skin quickly. however, i feel you need to drop directly on your face or it will absorb into your hands before it reaches your face. it also has a strange nostalgic early s plastic scent that i do not love for a cleaner skincare item. i have noticed a nice glow, but my fine lines seem more visible? if that is possible.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from farmacy beauty. unlike many other bha toners i have used, this one did not tingle at all. it is a super gentle formula that is also effective. i have been using it for the past few days and i am really liking it. the scent too is quite neutral and refreshing.",positive
"for, this sunscreen should be flawless, and it is not. if this was not so expensive i would say it is a decent sunscreen, but why charge so much for something that you have to put a lot of effort into in order for it to work? it is difficult to spread at first, gave me a white cast that got worse each time i reapplied every hours and i looked like a grease ball, not to mention if there is something i cannot stand is when a sunscreen pills. i tried this unscreen with my normal skincare routine toner, hydrating serum, vitamin c, moisturizer and then i tried it with just moisturizer and each time it peeled like crazy. again, for people should not have to deal with any of this.",negative
"this stuff left my face so sticky and tacky it was disgusting. i gave it a chance for an entire week, trying a little and then a bit more and no matter what it left my skin feeling sticky. even with a moisturizer on top the stickiness did not go away. i had to wash my face and use my other brand serum instead. i would not recommend this. i am giving mine away.",negative
"this product was way too harsh for my sensitive skin. i have oily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin. this stripped all of the moisture out of my skin and gave me what seemed like burns on my face. i had to use very moisturizer for over a week to get my face to heal.",negative
"did notice it brighten my complexion slightly, but omg it is so drying. i could only use it every once in a while and it left my skin feeling stripped every time so it just was not worth it. into the garbage it went.",negative
"the only reason i give it stars is because you have to use it daily to keep the color going. it is very light, even for my super light skin tone. i think the medium shade even for light ish skin will work okay and stay on longer. i like it because you just mix it in with lotion so you can apply to face andor body. no spotchyness or uneven tone.",neutral
this used to be my holy grail tanning product until they reformulated it. the product being clear makes no sense because you cannot see it while you are putting it on and the end result is the most uneven and splotchy tan ever. it is also extremely sticky now and comes off easily before you rinse. i guess i will go back to st tropez,negative
"i have combination, acne-prone skin. this year i have not had much cystic acne, but this product caused a ton of cysts to form around my chin and it also stings my eyes. it does a fine job at removing makeup, but i will not be finishing my bottle because of the irritation it caused for me.",negative
"i do think this product helped some of my dark, untextured acne scars lighten up a bit. that being said i do not know if it has brightened my skin at all. i love to have glowing skin and this just seems so-so for that effect. i do like the smell of the product and i must say for an aha toner it does not leave my skin feeling super tight which is nice. however i would attribute other products to any glow my skin has had since using this product. i received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.",neutral
"pretty disappointing. i primarily bought this to help with dark circles but did not see anything more than a slight temporary improvement. my makeup caked and that really highlighted all my fine lines. not good! and then to top it off, i experienced the same thing other reviewer also stated. the product ran out very quickly. i pulled the container apart to find a heavy plastic interior with a ton of product left in it. needless to say i will be cutting it open and using every last drop to get my moneys worth. then i am moving on to a different eye cream.",negative

so i got a sample of this with my order and i was really thinking how bad can this smell. like it cannot possibly outweight the benefits. honestly i would not recommend this product. there are so many other well formulated products that no scent. i do not see why they released this,negative
good texture overall. feels a little sticky after application. i have not noticed a difference in my skin after using it for a couple of months. i will keep using it until i finish the bottle but i probably will not repurchase this.,neutral
"bought this cleanser because of all the great reviews but was not impressed. i have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin, it completely broke me out all over my cheeks and chin which was really upsetting because the cleanser actually works fairly well in terms of removing makeup and it does smell nice.",negative
"amazing product! added to my alternate routine for now as i have been using the olehenriksen c-rush brightening serum set. loving both products. love the fragrance of this wrinkle blur more than c-rush. the packaging could have been more thoughtful to optimize the use of serum inside this tiny little bottle as it is on a luxury product side, would not want to leave the serum in the bottle towards the end. other than that, i would give a thumbs up.",positive
"honestly not the biggest fan it made my face extremely oily and not flattering at all. i will admit it definitely gives the look as if you have foundation on, but the extreme oiliness was a no go for me. i would much rather take a few extra minutes and put actual foundation on, but that is just me!!",neutral
i received this product from skinfix to try and i i have mixed feelings about it. first i am not too much of a fan of the smell. i mean it is not so bad but it is not great either. i do like the way that my skin feels after use but i have not noticed a difference in it either. maybe after using a bit longer i will be able to see results.,neutral
"this is a great product but it is tiny. oz and the bottle it comes in feels like it is almost empty. you can get the amazing sunscreen beet shield from krave beauty online a korean brand that is so good for a little over and you get almost double the amount.oz. that is my favorite sunscreen i have bought multiple bottles of it and it also contains vitamin c and antioxidants. highly recommend trying that one since this is outrageously priced for sunscreen. you need finger lengths of sunscreen to actually protect your face and neck so you will go through this in no time. no need for the huge price tag. go the korean skincare route, krave makes the best sunscreen i have ever tried i love it. this is not a bad product, it is nice, but it is thicker and a little greasier than kraves, and the price just does not make sense when you compare to others that have similar ingredients. your paying for the brand name.",neutral
"after using the product for a week, i saw a significant decrease in acne and my scars have started fading away too! love it and would buy again",positive
"in a nutshell, this product works great and you will notice a difference in your skin. however at a bottle i can not recommend it when i know there are other brands that show the same results for much cheaper- i would recommend the drunk elephant serums instead. also the packaging was very cheap and my dropper broke the first time i used the product.",negative
"using this product makes me so happy. i love the packaging, the fine mist, and the natural watermelon scent. will definitely repurchase my second bottle very soon!",positive
"this product embodies the old saying if it sounds too good to be true...it probably is. like everyone else, i wanted to love this product and be confident ditching the more expensive hyaluronic acids i have tried from brands like drunk elephant and skinceauticals. unfortunately, this is so far from being a dupe, it is not funny. each time i have tried using it everything seems fine until i go to add a follow-on layer of moisturizing oil, cream or sunscreen no matter how long i leave it to dry, it pills, leaving a bunch of grit and gunk that has to be tediously wiped off. i never had this problem with the other hyaluronic acid serums i have tried. the few times i have tried to use it i have not noticed any up-ticks in acne breakouts like some reviewers, however, i imagine anything capable of pilling and gunking-up the way this does is also likely to clog pores. if you are looking for a lowish-budget alternative, try neutrogenas version.",negative
"i tried this to help with redness on my nose and chin at the recommendation of a sephora employee. i loved how it made my skin look, but after a couple of days my skin started drying and peeling i think it was probably the alcohol in this. i tried using it along with a moisturizer, but did not help as soon as i stopped using this my skin went back to normal. i live in a really dry climate though denver so i would maybe recommend this product if you are anywhere else- then maybe the alcohol does not make such a difference!",neutral
"i really wanted to love this, but it just does not leave my skin feeling as clean as other products. it was recommended to me when i was looking for something that would not dry out my skin, so it fits the bill there. it is a luxurious texture and feels great while using it, but using it consistently for over a month my skin just was not feeling as clean as it could be.",neutral
"i love this moisturizer for under makeup during the day. i have normal skin which gets drytight if not properly moisturized. i also can get oily occasionally. i feel like this moisturizer keeps my skin smooth and even. i was using the de protini peptide moisturizer and i did really love that one, but the jar only lasts about- weeks, and i could not justify the cost. the texture of this moisturizer is very similar to that moisturizer and for me, the results have been similar, though the de version is much more luxurious. this is a better long term option for me, though.",positive
"this is a good spf but the bottle is poorly made. after a few uses, the purple on the main bottle will come off and get everywhere. i do not know how a company can make something and not do a quality check on the bottle.",negative
"i thought the days of glowing, smooth, even-colored eyes were gone once i had my under three but this eye concentrate has literally eliminated any signs of sleep deprivation! not only does the wand make the application cool and relaxing, but the product itself is a miracle worker. i love to apply this alone, with tinted moisturizer or even foundation, it works with anything to make the eyes bright and beautiful again. i cannot recommend this product enough and cannot wait to repurchase once it is in stock again.",positive

the product is very affordable and gentle on the skin however i found that although it was labeled as a make up remover it did not do this very well if you are looking for a remover definitely try the versed cleansing balm over this. it is a very gentle and affordable cleanser but it did not give me any differences that i was looking for,neutral
"i would highly not recommend this product for someone with oily skin and enlarged pores. i tried to love this product twice and the last time i got it from the sephora clean set. however, every time i switch to this cleanser my pores look larger the same day and the next day. i guess it is a good catch for someone with dry skin.",neutral

"this is my favorite moisturizer because it is the only one that will not break me out. i have combination skin and will break out often but, when i tried any other moisturizer my face was full of acne this one keeps it in balance and most of the time i have either none or pimples which is a blessing. recommend for dry or combination skin, if you have oily you may look very greasy.",positive
"i am in love with this face wash. it has a very very light clean citrus smell and it just feels so gentle and fresh. i was in the mood to try out a new cleanser because i like switching things up a bit for skincare, but i just cannot let this go. i had to repurchase.",positive
"this is not a clean brand!! why? they have perfume. perfumeparfum does not have to disclose ingredients as they are considered proprietary. also, i got a deluxe sample of this that i was looking forward to using cuz, clean and the perfume was so strong i could not wash this off my face fast enough! this should not have a clean mark if it has unknowable perfume ingredients.",negative
i like the idea of this and the solution smelled good but i found it super irritating on my skin after about minutes. i would not say i necessarily had a reaction but it felt extremely drying and it stung.,negative
literally does nothing. i do not think it is strong enough at all. i was using it to get rid of dark spots from acne scars.,negative

"not sure how i feel yet. just got my first tube. i have been using the tinted moisturizing sunscreen by eltamd for over a year now and i love it!!! but i was interested in this dewy look that is on trend now. a little glowscreen goes a long way on my cafe au lait complexion. the formula is light and applies smoothly, but compared to eltamd i was still able to feel it on my skin. i was not uncomfortable, but i knew it was there. the glow was real. not sure i like that look allover on my skin. i looked oily. so i think i will stick with my eltamd its wonderful and use the glowscreen to enhancehighlight my face in areas. i will try again on a different day to see if i feel differently.",neutral

"i got this from ipsy and it is one of my favorite moisturizers. my skin has been so clear since using this and it gives me this amazing glow. i typically do not buy products if they are not on sale, but i would repurchase this at full price if i had to. this cream is not for people who do not prefer rich and thick hydration. for me it is not overwhelmingly thick, it is just right. for others who prefer a sheer moisture, this may not be for you.",positive

the fragrance is too strong. product is too drying for older skin,negative
works really well to remove waterproof mascara and makeup but for some reason makes my eyes burn! just not worth it. so my fav for removing makeup is either using a makeup eraser and the lancome bi-facial remover or farmacy cleansing balm.,neutral
the formula is easy to apply and has no order. a little heavy and i noticed it clumps sometimes under makeup. i mostly use it on the days i am going makeup free or on days where i am going to be outdoors. leaves a shine after application.,positive
it works well but i cannot get past the overpowering lime smell. it also sticks to my eyes and tends to get into my eyes. would not buy again. there are other balms and oils that i prefer.,neutral
"thought about purchasing this, finally got a sample, wanted to love it but unfortunately i did not even like it. it was a pretty generous sample so there was enough for multiple uses. the first time i tried it i thought the smell was pretty strong and the product was not absorbed well by my skin. used it a few more times but never actually finished the whole sample because this product simply is not for me. if you are sensitive to fragrances definitely stay away from it. will stick to my regular moisturizer which costs far less",neutral
"i really like this a lot. although i find that the formula can be inconsistent. some people have said that it gets very tacky and hard to apply, which the last bottle i had was not like that at all. it was easy to apply and went on smoothly and was easily removed. the bottle i currently have is incredibly tacky and it feels like i am pulling my skin along with it just trying to remove my make-up. i still like this product a lot as it is a very gentle way to remove make-up, i just wish it was a consistent quality.",positive
"i buy it because it is vegan and that is tricky to find, especially at this price. i do not like that it takes a long time to absorb at least on my skin. you can see it sitting there minutes after i have put it on.",neutral
the smell is overpowering and unpleasant. renders it absolutely unusable..,negative
this is way to expensive for the amount of product in it. for only. oz. this will last you less than a month if you are using it everyday and night. there are so many cheaper moisturizers with much more product. do not waste your money on something that is not worth it.,negative
just fine. my skin did not love or hate this cream. i did not see a notice difference in my skin texture. i did not feel like it was too oily or too dry on my skin. feels like an average cream. i would use it again if it was not for the price.,neutral
this product actually works! i have larger pores than i would like to admit and i could actually see a difference within the first use! not to mention it smells heavenly and fresh. i would highly recommend,positive
"great night cream. it is thick enough for night, but not greasy or oily.",positive
"the kiehls powerful-strength dark circle reducing vitamin c serum has a thick consistency that blends into the eye area. i do not really have dark circles, so that part really did nothing for me, but i do have wrinkles under my eyes that i hate. i did notice after a while that the serum dried out my under eye, resulting in dried crease lines flaking, so i just made sure to moisturize after putting on the serum. my only reservations are its tendency to dry out my undereye, and honestly i did not really see much results of my wrinkles lessening. i was gifted the product in exchange for my review.",negative
"i received this from influenster and have been trying it out for a month now. it has a nice consistency and nice smell, but i have not noticed a big difference in my skin. i suffer from dry skin and it took weeks before i noticed a difference- and it was just a small one, my forehead was less dry, but the rest of my face there was no difference. for the amount it costs, i expected more.",neutral
"nothing impressive about this serum. i do not understand all the great reviews. it has nice packaging, smells fine and absorbs quickly, but i have not noticed any difference in the texture or appearance of my skin. i wanted to loved it, but i do not.",negative

"i received this product for free for testing purposes. i mainly used this lotion on my afternoon jogs. i love that it was able to withstand my perspiration and the smell is amazing. my only problem was the texture was a bit too runny. but other than that, i would definitely recommend.",positive
"it started off decently but then when i got through about half the bottle, the smell became stale and gross, i had to throw it out which was a waste, and it was within the expiration time listed. maybe it was an old product. not worth the price.",negative
"this is one of the few moisturizers that do not irritate my skin or make me break out, which is why i like this product, however it is not hydrating enough for me. it also does not make that big of a difference in my skin barely hydrated and dull, which makes this moisturizer not work it, especially considering the price point.",neutral
"i am torn on this product. a little goes a long way, and if used in the right amount, it is gorgeous! it really makes you glow. use too much and you look crazy oily! it also pilled when i was putting on more makeup. this is a great option for someone that does not want to wear foundation or concealer and does not reapply sunscreen throughout the day or use a ton in the morning.",neutral
this patches are amazing! i got my forehead marks almost evened out overnight. i have used the patches for weeks now and i have ordered more. even though i have not used them long enough to see long lasting results not having those pesky lines for a couple of days after each use is worth the expense.,positive
i love these eye masks before an event they really depuff and brighten my eyes! sometimes to give an extra boost a take an ice cube and gently massage it on top of the eye mask and it gives a very lifting effect!,positive
"i was a fan of the original salicylic acid that the ordinary unfortunately discontinued. i was excited to see this as i thought they finally restocked it. however, this is a new version and it is completely different. it has squalane in it who asked for squalane by the way?! i put this new version on a small pimple thinking it would be gone by the morning. that is how fast the original formula worked! but by next morning, on christmas!, my pimple was two times as big and it hurt!! this new formula is super oily probably due to the dumb squalane in it and i am pretty sure it clogged my pores leading to the giant christmas zit i had!",negative
"i received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review. i was excited to try a new cleanser that seemed hydrating based on the description of milly. unfortunately, this is a huge flop. it has the consistency of water and i wasted way more product than i should have just trying to get enough to cleanse my face. i also had to wash twice to get a good cleansed feeling. overall i would not recommend this as a full time cleanser, maybe as a morning cleanser on a cotton round to refresh skin. complimentary from laneige",negative
i got this as a sample and will not purchase. the cream did not absorb and am allergic to the fragrance. i got headaches both times i applied it. i woke up in the morning with a greasy feeling.,negative

"removed makeup okay but made me break out, however could definitely work for less acne prone skin",negative
"this product makes a big claim that i was so hoping would work but i do not think it lives up to it. the packaging is beautiful and the ingredients list is really good but maybe it needs more time to work. i took it for days without much difference. i mixed it with oz of water as instructed. it mixed very well for me and tasted smooth and tangy- similar to tang or sunny d. it is pricey for what it is but if you are able to get it, it seems like a promising product.",positive
first time trying this eye cream and i have been using it for a couple months every night before bed... it moisturizes well and feels smooth when applied. does nothing else for my dark circlesbags. will not be repurchasing!,negative
this product is perfect if you were unprepared to wear shorts and have to slather some on quickly to get a healthy glow. it is not too hard to apply if you really get it on there. it almost seems like it would be best mixed with another moisturizer. definitely need a mitt or artist soap with grain to get it off of your hands. color is pretty. love the sparkle in it.,neutral
"very thick texture, not what i prefer. this oil also did not absorb into my skin which i did not care for. however, this product did not break me out, it is a high quality product it just is not for me. the fact that this did not disturb my insanely sensitive skin speaks profoundly about the quality ingredients. i definitely would not purchase this again. the thickness would not bother me so much if the product was able to absorb into my skin. it created a nice superficial barrier but ultimately felt heavy and greasy since it never absorbed.",neutral
"i have recently written a glowing review for the tan-luxe self tanning drops, so this is sort of a direct comparison. i have been using the tan-luxe for about a month now and i have been so impressed with the gorgeous, consistent color it gives me. it looks natural and not at all streaky or orange. while i have been using the tan-luxe, i have accumulated several samples of isle of paradise medium self tan drops, in both the packets and the dropper bottles. i have enjoyed my tan from tan-luxe so much, i figured i would give another product a try. the result? i feel like i need to protect you from this product. it looks completely orange, and not just streaky, but somehow also spotty. like, it had separated somehow into these discrete spots. i gave it several days of using it to give it a fair shot before writing this review, but it is so bad that even my husband noticed. why does your tan look like that?? there is a much better product on the market, so there is no reason to settle for a bad fake tan when you can have a beautiful one.",negative
"patch test first!! i have never considered myself to have especially sensitive skin, but after using this product for a few days, i noticed my skin starting to peel and was not sure what was causing it. tonight i removed my makeup to find a raised orange rash on my forehead, plus a lot of angry red patches and bumps all over. i had my suspicions that it might be this ren ahi toner since it always stung a little when i applied it thought that was normal but after reading all the star reviews with similar results, it confirmed for me that this product is the because. it is definitely not for everyone-- even if you do not think you have sensitive skin!",negative
"i would been wanting to try this line of products for some time now, but the steep price of the full size products scared me off every time. i got to try a deluxe sample of it thank you, sephora birthday gift! and i absolutely loved it. my skin is very reactive and sensitive, so i am very careful of what i put on it. i did break out a tad a few small whiteheads the first few days i used it, so i just used a bit less going forward and it subsided. i feel like this cream makes me look years younger! i definitely see the plumping effect it has reduced the appearance of some fine lines i was starting to get. i use this as recommended a shot of protein in my daily skincare smoothie. i will definitely be buying the full sized product.",positive
"i am very happy with the results i have seen in the last weeks! i received this from yttp to try and to give an honest review. i have tried a few other vitamin c serums in the past and they either broke me out or did not really do much. i can honestly say that i can tell a noticeable difference in my skin...it is more glowing, clearer, and brighter! i am and have a little bit of texture in my cheek area and since i have started using this, i can see that it is a bit smoother! i really think this is a solid product and will purchase a bottle once i have used this one up! and that is saying a lot because i tend to get frustrated with skincare products because i cannot see a noticeable difference, or it works the first few days and then it kind of fizzles out. but with this serum my face is looking better and brighter every day i use it.",positive
"i wanted to love this product but ultimately was not happy with the results. the jurys still out on whether this did much to improve my dark spots.pros- the bottle is adorable.- the fruity smell is very pleasant.- the serum is a nice texture not super sticky, felt nice upon application, and absorbed quickly.cons- as several folks here have already mentioned, the adorable bottle is also super impractical. the pump tube does not go all the way into the bottle so you cannot get all the serum out with just the pump. fortunately the pump comes off and luckily i have makeup spatulas handy a must have, by the way, and i was able to get all worth of product out of the bottle that way.- it is, and based on other reviews as well as my own experience, the results are hit or miss. there are vitamin c serums out there for less than half the price of this that are just as effective if not more. i bought this product to see if paying more money would get me an even more effective vitamin c serum, but i do not think i have concluded that that is the case, and will probably go back to what i was buying from amazon.other notes-the entire bottle lasted me one month with daily use used it twice on a few days.i would say give this a try if you are willing to do a experiment. otherwise look elsewhere.",neutral
"i have very fair skin with coolpink undertones. the tint in this product was too pink and yellow based on my skin and you it looked like i was wearing a foundation that was the wrong color! this product also piled on my akon which was super annoying. i decided to return it after trying it several different ways with no improved results i tried it on freshly cleansed skin, with no other products underneath and it still piled.",neutral
i was gifted this product to try out and review. it claims it will blur dark spot and redness. it does blur my dark spot and redness a bit but it does not fade it. so do not think this product will fade your dark spot. i have been using this product for over a month and did not see any difference. smoother looking skin. since it does blur my skin so it does appear smoother. but i did not notice my skin appearing to be smoother once i wash it off. been using it for over a month. but also to be fair i do not have much lines or wrinkle. more luminous skin. this product blurs your skin and does provide a natural finish without mattifying your skin. so it does give the illusion of healthy natural skin.i am a year old with light skin and just starting seeing fine lines on my forehead. i have a couple of brown spots on my face. light makeup user. i mainly use this product as a primer since it feels silkysilicone like feel. i do not use this during my night time routine due to its texture. it has a slight floral smell that does not bother me at all. as a primer my makeup does glide on nicely. there is occasional ball up but that could be the skincare product i use underneath thts affects it. first the price i do not really see that this product is worth it. i am going to keep using it and see if there are any improvement on my skin. but for the price i cannot justify the is worth purchasing this product. there are primers out there for less and does the same job,negative
"i went against the product description and got this for my dry skin, because of the clinique moisturizers i have tried, this one seemed like a good moisture payoff for the price and it does not irritate my skin like many moisturizers, possibly because it has no fragrance which i refer. this is my day moisturizer and it works well under makeup. i would wear a thicker cream all the time but thick creams would clog pores on my nose...so i use this in the day which is a nice compromise and origins apricot mask at night which is also great considering the price.",neutral
"unless you are okay with the sunscreen smell on your face, i do not recommend. i bought the spray superfood that allows you to spray over your makeup.",negative
"there is been so much hype surrounding this product and while it gives a dewy look if you are darker skinned like myself you will need a lot of product for it to even show up on your skin. it is also not moisturizing at all! it drys to an almost textured feeling, not very pleasant so i started mixing it with my moisturizer. considering i have to use more for it to show up and the price vs size of the bottle i would say this will not be a repurchase and if you are on the fence about it i would say skip it.",negative

so honestly... it could be just me. but this product did nothing for me. i was not really looking for anything for fine lines or dark circles but i really just needed something to hydrate my under eyes so i decided to try this since i like the kiehls moisturizer. but thjs product did absolutely nothing for me. i am also on accutane so my skin is bone dry right now but for the price i do not think a little hydration is too much to ask for.,negative
"best cleansing balm hands down! i have sensitive skin, the product melts away my heavy makeup beautifully. the scent is also lite and delicious. must buy!!",positive
"this suspension works miracles. i am super pale, so redness and scarring are really apparent on my skin. this product helps tone down both, as well as prevent future breakouts from occurring. it does not play well with makeup, so i only use it in the pm, or on days when i am not wearing makeup at all.my only complaint is the silicone texture and slight scent that it has. the phenomenal results definitely outweigh that though.",positive
i did not see much of a difference when using this product,neutral
i originally got this as a free sample and it did wonders for my skin i had to purchase the full size. this is a permanent part of my nighttime routine,positive
"by no means has this product been life changing for me, but things that i have noticed and like about this product is that it has a non-sticky formula, layers well with other products, looks good under makeup, inexpensive, and did not because breakouts. i would say this is a good starter or introductory skincare product for beginners.",positive
"this was not the mask for me, its heavily fragranced and after a week of use this i saw no difference in the texture or quality of my skin. other fresh masks leave my skin feeling smooth and refreshed but this one did nothing but give me a headache",negative
feels good and is at a good price point but i think this is the culprit of my new breakouts. not a clear-skin product.,negative
daily peel works to keep oily skin clear but this product does not give the glow other products do and is very costly.,neutral

"i have been using this a couple times per week for weeks. a little bit goes a long which helps justify the price. the product feels very nice on the skin. i appreciate how fine tiny the little exfoliating beads are, it feels high-quality. that being said, i have not noticed any instant glow as per the products title. i also have not noticed any significant difference in texture but i will continue to test the product.",positive
unfortunately one of the worst skin care moisturizers i have ever tried. left me greasy and broke out. and i do not normally have acne,negative

got a freebie of this product and had to have the full version. i do not know about the transformative character but this feels amazing on your skin and the lavender scent helps me get to sleep. may not be for you if you do not like strongly scented product but personally i cannot get enough.,positive
"cannot rave enough on how much i love this! i have been using this for years, each time i get a breakout here and there. however, i have been breaking out so bad on my jaw and i began worrying. this helped bring the acne down. day and i can see a big difference! highly recommend!",positive
terrible terrible terrible!!!!! i have never hated a product more!!!!! its gritty and greasy and sits on top of your skin and does not sink in. you cannot layer any other product with it without it pilling. hate this. do not purchase.,negative
i want to love this product but it it too heavy and greasy in my opinion. i already use layers of skincare in the am and adding this is just too much to then go and try to put makeup on top of. i wish it did not have spf in it because i would use it at night instead. i have been on the search for a hg product to combat my redness and this is not it. i do not feel i can give it a fair assessment because i cannot bring myself to use it regularly enough to see if it really does what it is supposed to.,neutral
"i liked the feel and smell of this cleanser and it worked well enough, but it burns my eyes so bad. not sure how you are supposed to remove eye makeup with this. my skin did feel soft and clean after a second cleanse though.",neutral
"okay so this is a decent product. the soft feel container and simplistic design really play into the psychology of it. truly, it is the same texture and benefit as any other moisturizer to me...at a super high cost. stars only because yes it does moisturize, but just as well as any other product. there is no special secret ingredients inside that are going to change your life. i think this gets so many stars because people feel they have to justify the high cost they spent and convince themselves it is an above average product- but it is not.",neutral
"honestly, i thought this was a great sunscreen...at first. following derm recommendations, i tried to reapply this sunscreen, and i had straight piling. so much pilling to the point i had to wash it off completely. it really put me off of using it. this would be great under makeup where you have to apply a power spf over your makeup because otherwise, reapplying any sunscreen overtop of it makes piling happen...",neutral
"this is a luxurious eye cream that follows through on brightening and depuffing thanks to the caffeine and ginseng root extract. it has a yellow tone with a radiant finish and instantly brightens my dark undereye area. it feels smooth going on, and a little goes a long way--one pump is more than enough to moisturize around both eyes. it does not have much of a scent, which i appreciate. i would definitely recommend this for those like me who deal with dark circles due to lack of sleep or genetics.",positive
really loved how this was easy to absorb on my skin and was light weight! i usually reapply after two hours and this did not feel like it was greasy in fact it left a great satin matte finish. it has an earthy like clay smell but it is not strong. i wish it was not so expensive but it is worth the price tag. the fact that it is compact and easy to store in my purse is a plus too! gifted by tatcha,positive
"love love love. i have some eczema patches on my face and only my moisturizer does not do the trick. i use this in the morning after i wash my face with rainforest of the sea and before my moisturizer also rainforest of the sea, drink of ho and the results are amazing. i find my skin is so smooth and my patches of eczema are completely gone.",positive

"honestly i have been using this for awhile now,,, it is not doing anything for me. it is not bad but it did not give me the supple glass skin that those who swear by it claimed. if anything it clogged my pores and gave me a couple pimples. overall would not recommend as a southeast asian with clear combination skin.",negative
i received this product for free from influenster. the packaging is beautiful and there is a lot of product. all you need is one pump for application. it does leave a glow to my skin but i have not used it long enough to see major results and i do not think i will continue to use because of the scent. i do not know if i just got a bad bottle because other reviewers say that there is no scent but my serum smells like baby vomit. i do not know why it smells that way but i have to hold my breathe when i apply this.,neutral
"this product is fine but that is not really why i am writing this review. it is supposed to come in metal packaging but mine came in plastic and the cap came off burst while i was working and leaked all over my pants. i kind of want to return it but i am not sure if i will be able to him because the stores near me are all closed. in terms of formula, it is a a little and takes a while to absorb.",negative
love this product. i got compliments the first day i used it. definitely recommend!!!!,positive

"gifted by benefit cosmetics! i have been looking for a new toner to try. my first impression is i loved how the bottle is a foam toner and you do not need a lot of product. after using it the first time my skin burned for the first seconds and then went away. i did notice my nose and chin pores looked smaller. but due to my overly sensitive pregnancy skin, my face did not agree to the product. it left my skin red, splotchy, and itchy afterwards. i wanted to love this product but i do not think it is for my skin type currently.",negative
i love this moisturizer! it really proves how you do not have to spend a bunch of money to get good quality products. i also love that this product is made with clean materials. i would highly recommend this product.,positive
based on the reviews i expected a lot more from this product. it is not strong enough for eye makeup alone but does help lift it from the skin for easier removal as you cleanse.,neutral
"at first i truly did not think it could do anything because most toners i have use burn or leave a dry feel to it after i apply. but this one omgggggg it is so hydrating and did not make my face feel oily at all. i have been a difference in my face, it is been only weeks and my texture of my face feels so smooth!!!",positive

the only good thing about this product is the price. does not effectively remove makeup like other cleansing products and it does not feel enjoyable on the skin,negative
"the new formula is not the same. i have been told multiple times that the new formula is the same you simply have to activate it yourself. i cannot believe that this is the case. i used the old formula for a year and loved it! since the new formula hit my texture has worsened and my tone is no where near what it was before the switch. also it is so thin that when you dispense it from the packaging it ends up all over the walls, mirror, clothing etc. and it takes bleach to remove! the photos i posted are after scrubbing my walls multiple times! the amount you receive for the price just is not worth the new ineffective product. i hated to shelf this one but i have moved onto a new brand.",negative

"amazing for dry skin! i am someone who suffers from drycombination skin, and this stuff was a lifesaver for me. i had gotten the trial size i think it was something like.oz? and it lasted me over a year. i have been waiting months to be able to afford to reorder it. the tiniest bit goes a long way and it is one of the few cleansers that has cleared my skin of flaking and blackheads, and minimized the appearance of pores. it leaves me feeling so fresh afterwards. i use it with the peter thomas roth exfoliator in the grey tube, plus the water drench moisturizer, and it is the only thing that has ever worked this well for my sensitive dry skin. i absolutely love this product!",positive
"i just bought this and tried it for the first time. i do not usually leave reviews right away but i had to with this one, mostly because my friends had negative reviews about this mask. i absolutely love this mask. my skin has been so incredibly dry with being quarantined in my condo, and my skin immediately felt hydrated with this mask. it went on my skin so smoothly and i love how it smells. i also bought the jetlag mask so it will be interesting to compare the two.",positive
"not the best cleansing balm, but it does the job. i am not a fan of the thick consistency and the grainy texture. i bought this because of the packaging, but the end popped open when i tried to squeeze the product out the first time. if you have dry skin, you will enjoy this because it is super thick and moisturizing. i will finish the product, but i will not repurchase.",neutral
"the smell is strong, i have dry face so i thought this would help. it is sticky and oily, people said it dewy finish. i did not like the way it made my face shiny and dull. it is hard to apply my bb cream after. i went back to my old regimen. applying moisturizer and then sunscreen.",negative
i truthfully did not love this product. i used it morning and night for about days and i broke out pretty badly. i think i might have had better luck just trying it at night or every other day because it is such a thick moisturizer. i was in a pretty cold climate so i thought i could get away with it but i got zits everywhere. it was just too heavy and never really felt like it sunk in. major props to the packaging though. this moisturizer is beautiful but not a favorite.,negative
"i bought this reading the reviews and i am not going to lie, i am kind of disappointed. the pads are not soaked enough. after working the product in one pad only did half of my face. it seems really gentle because i did not feel any burning after applying. will have to use more to claim it helps with acnea. my skin felt softer the morning after.",neutral

"i tried this in conjunction with several other to products and this was the worst hydrator i tried. it left my skin sticky and made me break out. i am in my late s with oilycombo acne prone skin. tos marine ha serum worked out much better for me, i recommend that if you have similar skin to mine!",negative
"i wanted to love this. i really liked the original formula but halfway through the work day i was very oily. was hoping this would solve the problem. i had a terrible time getting this to blend. i tried damp beauty blender, brush, fingers etc, and nothing seems to work. it clung to my face in places and would smear off before i could get it blended in.",neutral
i am not percent sold on this product. does it make my eyes look nice after application but as soon as i put it on it burns for a good to minutes... i also do not like the glitter aspect because all you see is glitter under your eyes and no where else.,negative
does not emulsify no matter what i do. just leaves a balmy film on the skin. it is awful.,negative
"this product healed the worst scaley, dry, flakey eyelids of my life. my lids were so bad, everything was stinging, even neosporin. i was about to go to the doctor for help but this product finally did the trick. the only reason i do not give it of stars is because it is a little messy. it is a thick ointment that will become more runny as it warms up to your skin temperature. not conducive to applying makeup on top of... but it works.",positive
"i have been using tatcha the dewy serum for a few weeks now, in combination with the dewy facial cleanser and face cream. i received the serum complimentary in exchange for my review. i love the outer packaging, and i especially like the pump dispenser that doles out a tiny amount so you do not use too much. however, i was disappointed in the cheap plastic bottle design. the serum is light and absorbs nicely, and definitely leaves your skin dewy. i have noticed some of my skin texture on my cheeks is not as rough and my skin is much more moisturized. i have not noticed a change in fine lines or pores.",neutral
"smells really bad i gagged and noticeable white cast. i am on the light skin side of things, but that white cast. oof. luckily i wore makeup over it. makeup did wear well on this sunscreen. would not buy again or recommend. i will already just be forcing myself to finish it",negative

do not use if you have sensitive skin!! left my face sooo red and only had on for maybe min.. but my fault for not patch testing... plus side my skin is as smooth as a babies bottom!,neutral
smells nice and not too drying but it does leave a sticky bit of a feeling. it works great for under a moisturizer but i do not love it under makeup,neutral
"love the packaging as with all of drunk elephant products, their packaging is always on par.first off before use, i thought the price point was great for the amount of product you got, until i tried it out.. i felt like i had to use quite of bit of product compared to any other micellar water i have tried.for me personally, this is definitely not a one step product that takes off heavy makeup,but as a second step.it however does a great job at taking light makeup off.after application, i did not feel the need to rinse my face, it left it feeling soft and refreshed.with that said, i most likely would still repurchase this.",neutral
"too oily heavy for my liking, also has a chemical like smell that is not appealing to me. i got this as a sample from the birthday rewards",negative
this literally turns my face white and is impossible to rub it. i do not know how this is a face sunscreen. this reminds me of something that you would put on babies. how are people giving this five starts? this is literally the worst sunscreen i have ever used in my entire life.,negative
"i am not really big into cleansers but i was looking for something that would effectively remove my make up and avoid those stains in the towel so i bought the combo of the oil gentle foam. even after both steps i am still seeing makeup residue on my towels, which means is still on my skin. it does give a good feeling afterwards but it most definitely does not worth the money. my old cerave hydrating soap for cad does a much better work than this.",negative
"i love idea of this product, but unfortunately it makes me extremely oily. i guess the meadowfoam seed oil being the fourth ingredient is just too much for me. if you are dry i bet it would be great for you. i cannot even put a moisturizer over it. i am just a grease slick.i am pretty glad i got a sample of this rather than buying the full size, but i would definitely recommend it to dry folks.",neutral
been using this for months have not seen improvement,negative
my holy grail!!! i love this product so much! it literally cleared up my skin,positive

"i really was excited when i bought the mini size of this mask. i had heard soooo many good things about it over the recent years. the first time i used it, after minutes my face was slightly red... but after it looked like i had gotten the worst sun burn of my life. my skin felt raw and irritated. i put on some aloe and iced my face. i will be returning the mask as soon as possible and never recommending this size. i am hoping the formula is different in the full size?",negative
"i really wanted to like this product, but i found it underwhelming. to me it seems like a slightly tinted moisturizer, that is not great at tinting or moisturizing. i have used other primers in the past that were so much better at smoothing imperfections. i expected much more from dior. this product also clogged my pores and caused breakouts.",negative
"i was absolutely shocked by the results of these patches! yes, they move around at first because they are gel and slippery, but once you have them in place, my advice is just to relax until they dry a little and then they do not move and you can go on about your business. i have used them both of the recommended ways and was amazed. they work for the bags and darkness under your eyes but the were amazing for those crows feet! i could not believe how smooth the sides of my eyes were. just test it for yourself, smile and take a picture of your eyes on the side, then apply these for however much time you like fyi- i leave mine on for an hour, and then smile and take another picture after! amazing!",positive
"i used this as the first step cleanser to remove makeup once it was warmed up, it did that great! but had to use a second cleanser to remove the residue and finish cleaning my face. i also found that the product separated in the bottle so it would be really runny with more creamy chunks. would recommend the ordinary cleanser or farmacy cleaning balm instead, similar products without as much greasiness and do not separate in the container!",neutral
"i wanted to like this product because it was hyped for. but unfortunately the packaging really made the experience unpleasant. all the previous reviews about the packaging were accurate on how difficult it is to get the product out of the tube. no matter how much is squeeze it, the product will not come out. i would have to unclog it with a q-tip every time i use this product. inkey list should of put such a viscose product in a jar or make the tube opening larger so it is easier to use. the packaging is a real bummer.",negative
i have been using this product for about a month and i only used it on one side of my face so i would be able to tell if it was working. well...i noticed the skin was tighter less wrinklescrows feet and lighter. i have noticed that you must use it consistently. my only issue is how long it took for me to see the difference. you only use a little of the product so the tube will last a long time. it does not have a scent which is great because you can use it with your lite scented moisturizer. i saw a difference and it made my eye younger looking. overall it is a great product but not instant.,positive
very thick cream but it really moisturizes your skin! the only thing that threw me off was the scent. it reminded me of hair dye.,neutral

this is one of two retinol eye creams i have tried and neither worked me. this one specifically will cause a burning feeling when i apply sunscreen the morning after using this the night before. i think my eye area may just be too sensitive for retinol.,negative
i have larger pores on my cheeks and blackheads on my nose so i was initially excited to try the dr.dennis gross alpha beta pore perfecting,neutral
"smells great and does the job, but the fragrance and citrus oils could be irritating for some people. i cannot say i found it irritating, but i did find it clogged my pores and caused some breakouts, even when followed up with a good quality water based cleanser.",neutral
this product does not feel like a sunscreen! super lightweight and works as an all in one hydrator and sunscreen product. great underneath makeup and no sunscreen smell not greasy at all. feels like a hyaluronic face serum rather than a sunscreen.,positive
"biossance is one of my absolute favorite skincare brands-- the packaging is always beautiful, quality of the ingredients is top-notch, the brand is very focused on sustainability and clean products. that being said, i did not notice a significant change in my skin after a week of using this product. i am still not sold on the benefits of toner in general though, despite incorporating into my skincare routine morning and night. i did have a minor breakout that coincided with around the time i started trying this toner, but that could also have been attributed to the stress i was experiencing personally at the time. while the size of the bottle is substantial and the glasspackaging is so attractive, it is a bit difficult to dispense enough product to be effective. in addition, the toner itself feels a little less hydrating than other toners i have had in my rotation. however, it does have a wonderfully light, fresh scent that i love and it feels nice to put on my face after washing it. all in all, i will continue using it to see if there are long-term changes, but i am still not convinced on whether this is a product i would purchase.",neutral
"incredibly soft and soothing. i have noticed a difference with redness after. weeks. light, but nice watermelon fragrance. not overpowering nor long lasting for scent. a little of the serum goes a long way. zero irritation, zero clogging of pores. i plan on buying this product in full size i received sample.",positive
"this feels quite good on the skin, almost luxurious. it has a beautiful smell but the only bad thing about it is that it stings. otherwise, not a bad moisturizer.",neutral
"i was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because of the handful of negative reviews. i have learnt my lesson, give it a try myself. i am happy that i went ahead and got it. after use, i felt a difference that lasted til way after lunch the next day. so, i work from home and decided that i will try this serum at night and keep it on for as long as i could. i washed my face and patted a bit of the water off. i used pump and pat it all over my damp face. i let it dry while i put on my eye cream etc. once dried, i tried the glow recipe plum moisturizer as well and i definitely saw and felt a big difference in the mirror. i have been looking for a face routine that gave me a wow factor and i think i might have just found it!",positive
i was very excited to receive this complimentary from influenster to review! i unfortunately made a flawed mistake and started using another new product along side this and my skin freaked out. my skin broke out really bad so i need to revisit this product once my skin calms down so i can leave a proper review.,neutral
"i bought this because i love the toner and face wash in this collection, but this specific product does not seem to do much for me. the scrub is too uneven and the grains are too large for my liking.",neutral
received this in my play! box this month. it is super heavy for me. not bad but not for me.,neutral
"i am in my early s, and bought this product about weeks ago to add as a base layer to my skincare regimen. i have already went through half the bottle using it day and night. it is slightly sticky, but my combo skin soaks it up immediately and is ready to layer after a minute or two. i use about- drops for my face and neck. a drop literally does not cut it. i do not know if the formulation is different bottle to bottle, but i have watched videos and read reviews that all left mixed reactions on viscosity and stickiness of the product. this leads to me to believe there is not much quality control. i also feel like there is a minimal amount of active ingredients due to lack of results and the cheap price. as in my headline, this product might be sufficient for someone in their s just starting out with skincare with minimal problems, but this just does not cut it for my early aging problems. rating a because it might help that younger person and the price is good.",negative
i wanted to love it but is not as hydrating as la roche-posay toleriane purifying foaming face wash or the ordinary squalene cleanser. honestly is huge pass. will not purchase again.,negative
i have gotten a few of these in my skin kits and finally used them. i would have used then sooner if i knew how great they are. this is surprising hydrating without leaving residue. i was expecting a white mask that would dry and be wiped off etc. but it is a gel with brown bits from the flowers. that was refreshing and felt soo good on my skin. it goes on very easy. use liberally. the more i use the more hydrating i felt afterwards. i use it after any stripping mask. like charcoal or pore cleaning mask that makes my skin feels dry and tight afterwards. this hydrated my skin but did not go and reclog pores or feel heavy. it was not heavy enough for me to not use a moisturizer afterwards. i like it. it is my go to when i want hydration after deep cleaning pores. i would recommend it. great for a pre makeup mask since it hydrates and plumps but does not leave residue on the skin like other hydro masks or like the mario badescu mask to compare that is hydrating but leaves a residue after rinsing this is not strong enough to be like the sleeping masks or even a heavy duty hydrating mask. it is just perfect for balance. i would say it is a restorative mask. if your skin is extremely parched use a good slather of a heavy duty sleeping mask after a good steam treatment from extreme weather or something this will not make that much of a difference for you. but it is cooling and hydrating. i think it would be great for sensitive skin as well.,positive
"my skin reacted badly to it and it because whiteheads, sadly",negative
"i got this in a subscription, it smells amazing and is so creamy and easy to apply. my skin felt so soft but then about minutes later my chin and a couple other areas broke out!!! i am so disappointed. this mask is worth so much money... i cannot imagine if i had paid full price for this. i will not use it again.",negative
"i do not really know how i feel about this product. i do not mind the smell, i do not mind the consistency of the product when first applied but i do not like what it does as you rub it on your face. it is not a typical scrub but you feel almost like grains of sand but it is like you have rubbed still somewhat tacky glue around your face. i have even tested it on the back of my hand to see what was going on. still does it but not as bad if your skin is wet. it really bothers me. i do however like how smooth and bright my skin is so really i have to think which out weights which. i do know that i will not buy this product. i received this product for free to test from influenster which did in no way sway my opinion either way",neutral

"i purchased this product for under my makeup and touch up with the tarte sea set protect mineral powder. i definitely would not wear this product alone because of how much it shines and accentuates skin texture. but under my foundation, this product looks nice. not a huge chemical sunscreen smell, but i think they sit better under makeup than mineral. i typically wear tinted mineral sunscreen daily, but like this for makeup days. it does not have a strong smell which i like. it also dries down and absorbs quickly. i would say the cons of the product are the price and that it can pill if you use too much, so less it definitely more with this product. that being said, i love the concept of supergoop and other companies that create innovative suncare products.",positive
smells and feels fresh when washing but is incredibly drying.,negative
"i am usually a fan of anything from drunk elephant, but this product was a let down. unfortunately i had a very bad experience. to this products defence i did break the cardinal rule of retinol treatment by absentmindedly layering it over a serum that also had retinol. this resulted in strong sensitivity for my under-eye area, which ended with a mild chemical burn after also using eye-makeup remover one evening. once i realized my serum layering mistake, and let my skin heal which it did, i decided to use the product alone. the result was not any better. i still had mild sensitivity under my eye, and no well balanced product should produce any type of sensations for a long period of time. so this retinol cream was a big no-no for me. i do not know if it this will be true for everyone, which is why i did not give this product a star. as far as texture goes it is very nice, and did an ok job around my mouth area. just know i am someone who has combination skin and i do not have any sensitivity problems, but this product did because irritation.",negative

"this moisturizer did nothing for my skin, and i have been a sephora member for over ten years now. i suffer from dry skin and this moisturizer left me dry and flaky two hours after putting it on. not only that, but it was difficult to absorb onto my skin and left a filmy white paste. i buy first aid beauty products and they are much more well-formulated.",negative
really like the way this toner makes my skin feel and it smells great too! definitely helps the pores!!,positive
"on first impressions it throws me off as to why huda created a new brand-name just for a skin care product. had i not already known huda created this i would have never known the correlation between the two. with that being said my first impression of the packaging is that it is very cute. it is your typical box but i love yellow and i also love the holographic writing in the front and top. the actual product packaging tube feels cheap. the tube is flimsy but then you have a heavy duty cap. i do like that the cap is very wide so you do not have to worry about standing it up. regarding smell, this does not smell like fruit to me nor does it smell like any type of tropical smell i have ever smelled before. i am not sure that it is. i almost get a hint of lavender more than anything. texture is soft. the grit for scrubbing is very fine so it is very gentle. it almost melts away after a little scrubbing. it does leave my skin feeling soft and clean but i get that squidgy feeling while rinsing it. not sure if that is good or bad. should defiantly follow up with a moisturizer just to be safe. i think the price is high,. i love that it is clean beauty but you are paying for it and the aha and bha. also, it contains fragrance so if you have watched the biossance videos you know that can be misleading! with that, i feel like for a clean beauty product there is a crap ton of ingredients. you only need to use- times a weeks so i am curious to see if it actually evens out the skin tone. overall, i feel like there is room for improvement on the price, the smell and ingredients. i was given the product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.",neutral

"this is def a sample not a travel size. mine was also oxidized in the packaging before opening. it came out a dark amber orange color. it is alil stinky nothing uncomfortable but i do not find it hydrating or moisturizing in the least. very disappointed. with quarantine, this will be brown by the time sephora reopens and we are on lockdown. so i guess i am stuck with it.",negative
"the texture is nice, the smell is nice and it feel good on the skin. sometimes a bit of tingling. i bought this one because i saw a recommendation and i wanted to feel like a celebrity. i use it, but there must be something less expensive to do it as well. to me it is. not a mask but a cream that you leave on. there is nothing to remove after ten minutes and it is not the kind of cream you can put a good layer.",neutral
"love this cleansing balm so much that i had to buy it again. truly felt like it was detoxing my face at the end of the day and getting rid of stubborn acne that was stuck underneath my skin for so long. also this is very good at not over-stripping your skin!! i am a retina a user and this product did not irritate my skin. definitely recommend, as i am someone who has tried multiple cleansers!!",positive

i honestly do not like this for a cleansing balm. i will use it as a min mask but i honestly do not feel like it is cleansing my skin. and the gritty texture is not good for the eye area. i am super disappointed. i heard everyone rave about this but i prefer farmacy way more even though it is not as budget friendly. this will not stop me from trying other products from the brand but this is just a no for me.,negative

i received it as a gift. i love this peter thomas roth firmx collagen faces eye hydra-gel patches!it is easy to use. it includes one mini clip that can be used to pick up the patch and put on face. it can be absorbed quickly and totally by the skin. i feel my face and eye become firm and brighter after one week use. definitely see the difference.,positive

"i do not even know what to say. i swear to you my skin is probably the most complicated skin type ever. it is acne prone, oily, dry, sensitive, red, etc. after trying out some new makeup my skin broke out like crazy. my usual skincare was not helping, so naturally i started to panic. i found a sample of this moisturizer that i had and since i had nothing to lose i gave it a go. let me tell you from the moment i put it on i just felt something. i cannot explain it but it was like it was meant to be put on my face lol. after a day of using it, when i woke up the second morning i was in shock. my skin was glowy, less red, the stubborn breakouts from the makeup were actually healed which i never thought would happen. i have such a hard time finding a moisturizer than will not break me out and will actually give my skin some hydration. i immediately purchased a ton of other products from this brand after seeing such quick results. i am not one to leave the house without makeup, but i have a strong feeling this line will give me the confidence to go barefaced. please do not everrrr discontinue this, i will definitely cry! the only reason i took off one star was because it is not extremely moisturizing, but i ordered one of their oils to pair with it. other than that, this product is flawless.",positive
i have been using this product daily for almost a week now and i can say i am in love!! coming from someone who has very dry and textured skin this oil makes me face so smooth and hydrated the whole day! i also have sensitive acne prone skin and have not had any breakouts. the product does apply very oily or sticky feeling but i do not notice it on my face and it does not seem to clog my pores. if you are looking for a good oil for daily use to help with hydration and skin texture this is the one,positive

i was excited to try this out after seeing a dermatologist review this on youtube. this however did not work for me. one of eyes seemed to have a hard time opening and closing. like it drooped the lid or something. i thought it was just me but when my mum tried she also felt like something was making the eyes feel weird. i tried it after a while just to make sure it is this and then again the next day the same eye felt weird.,negative

"it did not really like this product. it is too thick compared to other cleansing balms. it did not really effectively remove my make up. and i broke out right after i started using it. i had to use a lot of product to get my make up off. i recommend clean it zero or clinique take the day off cleansing balms over this one. they are both much lighter, silkier formulas than the oat.",negative
i love the way this smells- it is a not-too-overwhelming citrus scent. and a little goes a long way with this product!,positive
"this product was light on my face, absorbed nicely. gave me a subtle glow and worked well it is my sensitive skin. however, as far as a vitamin c serum, i did not notice any brightening of redness or dark spots. i will probably try a different serum once this runs out.",neutral
this product is amazing! i have keratosis pilaris which is a form of eczema where your pores clog up with dead skin very quickly and it creates a lot of texture. this serum cleared almost all of my texture and made my skin very even and smooth and my fine lines on my forehead and my large pore areas cleared up pretty quickly,positive
did not really do anything for me. i would not recommend it to someone looking for caffeine benefits. very moisturizing though.,negative
i have been using this every night for weeks now. i do not see a change in my acne or blackheads. my skin is smoother and brighter. there is a glow. but that is it.,neutral
i did not see good changes. i expected more about this because the brand have nice products.,neutral
i really do not think this works? i have been using it twice a day every day for a month on selected dark spots on my face and have not observed any difference.,negative

"beware! my first time using it my skin purged like crazy. not one centimeter of skin was not covered in a whitehead. i was embarrassed for the first days. but now my skin looks the best it ever has. i am a regular at the medspa for hydrafacial and peels and this hands down gave me the best results. get through the first week after application and you will be blessed with clear, nearly poreless skin. my second and third applications did not result in purging, so i think with regular use it will be less scary!",positive
this is the best cream for dry skin. my feet were incredibly dry and i started using this cream. it was amazing how fast they healed. i highly recommend and i use this all over.,positive
"when i tried first time i loved the product! it really mimicked and filled all lines and eye contours. however, after i bought several times more i noticed that around of patches in the pack within one pair do not match each other one is super thin another very thick. the thick ones are the worst as they do not stay in place and do not attach to the skin... very disappointing as initially i liked the product. they should have a better quality control over their patches especially considering their higher end price. will not be buying anymore",neutral
"i have very sensitive skin and my skin looked a bit red anytime i used it. i only used it x week and did not really notice any significant change except mild irritation, but bhas and ahas usually irritate my skin. i might use it again to seemay try it on other parts of my body.",neutral
if i have got to to be honest i do not really think this product did anything to my face but it did make it feel pretty clean. i mean it is nothing expensive so i am not really mad about it. maybe it is just my face but it does not hurt to try it out.,neutral
"decent hydrating moisturizer but nothing special and does not deliver on promises. according to what is in my jar, the concentration of peptides is too low to be effective, so if that is what you are looking for it is not worth it. i liked the texture and it was hydrating so it did it is job as a regular moisturizer, but you can find something simple at the drugstore for much less if all you want is a regular moisturizer. do not regret buying it-- i liked the texture and it hydrated my skin-- but would not recommend or purchase again. i will stick with the ordinarys moisturizer for now.",neutral
this cleanser was just eh for me. i really like the packaging but i just do not feel like it did anything for my skin and often times my skin did not feel clean after washing even a couple times. i used it up but will not be repurchasing.,negative

"i agree with some of the other reviews on here... i have really dry skin, so i use mostly oils these days and i have tried a bunch. this one surprised me...it is definitely one of the best across all price ranges. it is moisturizing, sinks right in, brightens and smells great. i only need to use- drops. sometimes i put a moisturizer on top, but it is good on its own, too.",positive
"love this brand. i have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin at all. i not a huge fan of oils, but this really does work! takes off my makeup like nothing.",positive
"i have been using these pads for about three months now and overall i am quite satisfied. i have very sensitive skin so i love that their fragrance free and gentle on the face. they do not turn my skin red or break me out. i use them about four times a week. i do feel that they are doing a good job of exfoliating my skin, however i am not seeing major results in terms of reducing my pores which is too bad. but, because it is so difficult for me to find a gentle exfoliant i am sticking with them and will continue to use other products like masksserums to target my pores.",positive
"i do not believe this is bad product, it just did not work for my skin. i have acne that i am currently treating, so i get a couple of pimples every now and then, usually in my cheeks and chin. when i started using this products i started breaking out, and i did not make the connection until i saw pimples all over my forehead. needless to say that once i stopped using the products my face went back to normal. people with acne that want to give a try, beware that you could break out, or not, every skin is different.",neutral
i really love the tatcha products and the way this product sits underneath my make up is great. what is a bummer is the packaging. the product does not seem to want to sit in the bottle and every time i open it the product spills everywhere. it is a waste of money because the majority of the product ends up on my counter and not on my face,neutral
"moisturizer has a very nice consistency and sits well on the skin, but i am not a big fan of scented products and this one has a scent that was too strong for my liking and my allergies. would i recommend? yes with a but. if you do not mind scents, this is definitely not a bad product!",negative
"the price is what convinced me to try. great size for under? why not, right? i have been using it for about months now,-xs week, and have not really noticed much of an improvement. i did not feel any burning sensation at application, and i do not completely soak a cotton ball with it. i also just sweep across mainly my nose and cheek areas since those are the areas i wanted the improved radiance and skin clarity. please note if you have sensitive skin, you should not use thisfrom the website contraindications this formula should not be used on sensitive, peeling or compromised skin. please refer to additional sun protection note and other warnings in provided directions.",neutral
i have not really noticed any brightening with this and the metal piece always falls off when i try to spread the product. i do not have big dark circles so maybe someone who does will notice more of a difference.,neutral
this did nothing for my skin. i brought this to treat my post inflammatory acne marks and i used it for for two months straight with no results that is when i decided to get a consultation for a new skincare routine from a licensed esthetician. she said the same thing and swapped it out for the ordinary niacinamide zinc which did a tremendous job of fading my dark spots within just under weeks as well as stop another breakout in its tracks. i have no clue why the alpha arbutin did not work.,negative
"loving this glycolic acid toner so far. it is, which is a super concentrated acid, therefore making it very effective. it does not burn upon application, and i have sensitive skin, and leaves such a luminous glow on your skin after using it pm. i would only use it- times a week max!",positive
"i was excited and looking forward to using these masks! i was banking on it being amazing no question, so i bought at once. sadly it disappointed. the mask itself the two sheets, are great i did not mind that it was two and i liked that it was cotton. very sturdy. i am mostly disappointed in the serum. you cannot use any product, i top of it. at least what i have i use natural oils. a formulation i make of better oils than just olive oil squalane oil, just buy the pure squalane oil. timeless has a great one. anyway, when i put anything above it it just crumbles up, off, very disappointing. i make a better natural mask with honey,aloe, pink clay, hibiscus powder, rose water, rose hip, bakuchiol oil, goji berry oil, frankincense, that leaves my skin supple and way better than this. i make a batch and store in a glass jar in the fridge.",negative

"i am an experienced user of acids as i have been using them for years. i had such high hopes for this alleged miracle serum, but i found it fell short. i have used many other acid serums that did more for my skin. that is not to say this did nothing... it did help to chemically exfoliate and add a beautiful finish to my skin. it just did not keep my skin nearly as clear or my pores as cleaned out as other acids i own.",neutral
"i am on the hunt for a non-medical product for my eczemadermatitis, this came up and i decided to try it out. the price is a bit steep, but anything that can help me is worth buying. the solution is shiny, and it seems like it just sits on top of the skin. it was working for the first few weeks, however the product separated in the tube and it is hard to mix it back together. i eventually stopped using skinfix once i did not see any further improvements. stars- i like the clean label but the price and the lack of improvements made me switch out.",neutral
"best product i have ever bought! i use it twice a day and it made my skin so soft, evened out my skin tone and left it glowing. would recommend!!!",positive
my skin hated this toner! left my skin super red and irritated every time i used it,negative
this is such an amazing product highly recommend i just find it annoying how sephora is charging dollars over the price on the website i have sense started ordering directly from the company,positive
"this is a pretty aggressive product, so you will want to ease into it. start using it at night a couple times a week only and see how your skin reacts to it, and make sure you use a good sunscreen during the day because it will definitely be more sensitive. like others, i have concerns about dmdm hydantoin as one of the ingredients, especially coupled with acids that will allow it to penetrate deeper into your skin. i will not use this anymore for that reason. for the price, i did not get great results on my skin, so i am ok with not purchasing this anymore.",neutral
"gifted by glow recipe. i love that these drops are a thin, water-like texture. it has a lovely watermelon scent, but it is not overwhelming. i love the packaging, the pump makes it very easy to use. one pump is the perfect amount. it absorbs quickly into the skin. it feels very lightweight. it makes my skin feel very hydrated and dewy. it also gives my skin a very beautiful and natural baby pink glow. i did enjoy wearing it alone without makeup. it does feel wonderful under makeup too. it works as a great primer.",positive
used every night for about a month and my face started flaking it was so dry. stopped using for days and skin improved and flaking went away.,negative
i found this to be very drying to my combination skin. after a couple uses i literally had skin so dry it was peeling in places. i will still to the essence- this is going back. if you are super oily go for it.,negative
makes my acne shrink by half in size over night! i recommend this to alllll my friends and anyone who has breakouts or acne. just apply a super small dot to the pimple. works wonders!,positive
"here is the thing. i just got this order in but i can tell you i will not buy it again. the jar is very, very tiny and the top of the jar is made weird, i am not sure how to get the product out efficiently. i do not care how well this may work, for please design a better jar and give me more product. this looks like all trendy packaging is where they charge the money, not the actually product or how people would use it.",neutral
"this is the absolute worst cleanser. i rarely write reviews but i felt the need to come here and warm the next person thinking of buying it.this product smells, leaves residue on your skin and does not actually remove your make up. it is a waste of money and may make your skin break out. i threw it out after a few days.",negative
"not a fan at all. it does not absorb at all, just sits on top of the skin and eventually pills off. kind of gross to be honest. big no from me.",negative
this glow recipe sunscreen is very good. spf is great for my everyday application and it leaves my face absolutely glowing. it feels like it has protected my skin well and the added niacinamide is a bonus.,positive
i do not have breakouts often but when i do have a blemish appear i find typical spot treatments are too drying or ineffective. this one however is everything i could ask for as it gently heals blemishes in one or two days!,positive
i saw a slight difference in my hyperpigmentation from acne... unfortunately it would pill underneath my moisturizer felt like i was too busy wiping everything off because of the flakiness.,neutral
leaves a white cast! i prefer the glow stick over this product,neutral
"i bought this product looking for an affordable cleaning balm. i was a bit skeptical at first due to the fact that most balms come in jars and not in tubes, but purchased anyway. the smell was a bit weird, sort of like stale chemical oats? and the consistency is more of an oil then a balm. but overall the product takes most makeup off, and is a good price! would recommend if you want a cleansing oil, and do not mind the weird smell.",neutral
"really surprised by this. i am very dry and was skeptical at how this absorbed too quickly into my skin, but skin felt hydrated. since i am so dry i prefer heavier moisture at night. when i woke up my skin was still hydrated! i am really happy to have found something lightweight yet hydrating",positive
"this product was honestly very mid. i used the whole bottle just because it does its job, it cleanses. i did not notice any changes on my skin.",negative
"i had heard good things about this eye cream, and the sales associate was raving about it. i like it, but do not love it. it is a very thick consistency, which is okay under makeup as a sort of primer, but i do not wear makeup much so it was a bit heavy for every day use. i also found it very dewy, and made my under eyes shiny. i would not necessarily recommend unless you were putting it under makeup every day.",neutral
this product did its job- cleansed and repaired my face. i highly recommend to anyone with sensitivecombination skin. a little goes a long way with this product.,positive
"ignoring the price, this face cream is decent. it soaks in to the skin quickly and has a nice texture. it does keep my skin soft and smooth, but does not deliver the hydration that a dry lizard like me requires. this would probably be best for normal or combo skin. this will pull if you put too much product on, or if you layer with too many other things. but overall a decent face cream which you could dupe for a fraction of the price.",neutral
"this stuff is amazing, i would recommend only using in the one spot because it will dry you out but works really fast",positive
this is very thick and creamy. provides intense moisture for you skin and leaves your face feeling refreshed and plump. it applies very easily with your finger tips and is great for after a retinal treatment or serum.,positive
it is not worth the price because the bottle is just really small,neutral
"i am pale, but i love to tan. during the summer i am able to get pretty dark naturally, but i know tanning has its consequences so i have been trying to be better about it. i ordered the mediumdark because i already have some color on my face from the sun, but this stuff is great. i prefer the look of a natural tan over this, but at least this has no sun damage. it is a little orange, but i do not think it is that noticeable. i use four drops in my moisturizer every other day. i have pretty sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation at all. also it is not blotchystreaky.",positive
"i love love love this product!! it has worked wonders on my middle-aged oily, acne prone skin. coupled with the special cleanser, my hormonal acne seems to be almost eliminated after consistent use for just over a month. works wonders on my skin type, however those with drier skin might find it too harsh. took off one star because of the size.. ml is too small a package for a product you use daily. would love to see this offered in a larger size!",positive
"got a sample using some of my rewards points and i cannot get behind the hype of this product. it goes on really nice, the texture is refreshing and unique but aside from that i cannot say it did much for my skin. have not noticed much, if any, improvement to my skin using this instead of my regular moisturizer. if anything it is not hydrating enough for my skins needs. it is not a bad product by any means, but i would not purchase it myself as there are products out there which i find do just as good of a job, if not better, for a fraction of the price.",neutral
"i really wanted to live it but sadly had to return it. i am yr old mom with fatigued all around eyes. i have the puffiness, the circles, the chicken skin, the wrinkles, and dryness. makeup looks better if the skin around the eyes are well taken care of. i tried this rollerball oil for a month. i really liked the rose quartz ball and how it felt underneath my eyes. it did well to lightly and temporarily moisturize the skin, but it is an oil. it will not sink in right away and depending on how you do your makeup, this might not be a good am routine. i mostly put this on at night but hated when it would accidently seep into my eyes. i also wanted to put it on my lids, but you cannot or else you will have oil slicked eywballs. so the stars are for how nice it felt and little moisturizing and it is organic.",neutral
"love this correcting cream!! it is my go-to for date night or a day at the office as it lasts and when putting it on i feel pampered. it is a little thicker than a foundation and i find it dries quickly compared to other creams. the only con is that i have severely dry skin and have to be cautious with what i put underneath this, if i do not use a heavy moisturizer then my face gets very sore and tight and dry.",positive
"i am really enjoying this serum. it is lightweight, has a milky texture, and a pleasant green tea scent. it feels slick on the skin and absorbs pretty quickly. my skin feels instantly hydrated and moisturized. also, it leaves a bright, glowy, and healthy skin finish. and my skin is looking a bit smoother.",positive
amazing product... but received expired. i checked the batch code and it was produced in so it smelt foul. this is brand new to canada so why did it come from an old batch date?? disappointed,neutral
i love supergoop but this is a miss for me. i love the spf in it and it felt nice on my skin at first but became very greasy feeling. the worst part is the smell. it has that cheap sunscreen fragrance to it and it is very unappealing. it also irritated my sensitive skin.,neutral
does not help minimize any puffiness or dark circles. my eyes looked the same when i applied the product as they did when the product came off. must hold them in place while lying down as they do not stick to your eyes securely. hard to use.,negative
not a big fan of this product at all. it is almost like if you mix shimmer eye shadow in moisturizer type of consistency. i tried so many ways to make it work but do not work at all for my dry skin. i ended up throwing it away since it was over months to return.,negative
"first of all, i love this product- it works beautifully without stripping the skin. based on that, a-star. very unfortunately, i have purchased tubes and had a huge issue with both- the product is so thick and so difficult to squeeze out of the tube that the ends of the tube have ultimately split! unbelieveable. what a mess. i live in a very hot and humid place, and for this to happen in my climate is very, very strange. i am certainly not the only person this has happened to, and they should perhaps consider thining the consistency just enough so that it squeezes right out hello, like toothpaste...... a am very reluctant to purchase another, when both have been fails in this regard. shame, because i love what is inside the blasted tube.",neutral

my favourite moisturizer not a fan of the price increase and the new packaging.new packaging popped open when getting product out,positive
"unfortunately this product did not seem to make any difference for me. i am almost done with the pack, and used dots on active pimples for several nights to no effect. the only pros i can share are that they stayed on well through the night and prevented picking, however i have better luck with simple hydrocolloid bandages from a drugstore for a fraction of the price.",negative
"pros good price. pump works great if you like your eye cream in a pump like i do. very moisturizing. works really well under makeup. does not because any irritation.cons not effective for dark circles or puffiness. bottom-line depends on your expectations for an eye cream. purchase this if you need a good moisturizer for sensitive skin, but do not expect much else.",neutral
"this is my fav skincare purchase of, i have been using it daily for several months now and it has had amazing results on my skin. texture is better, my skin feels hydrated continually. it is the only step i changed and i saw a quick response from my skin even the first week after using. smells divine. this is now on my list of holy grail products i cannot live without.",positive

"i was really surprised with how well this worked on my skin. i have always had relatively clear skin, but thanks to covid, i have developed maske and perioral dermatitis, and i am struggling to find the right products. however, i noticed a difference almost immediately in my skin, it seemed to dry up and shrinks the bumps, and combat the redness. i have not noticed any extra oiliness that some of the other reviews mention.",positive
feels great! have not seen a massive difference in my skin after weeks but not a bad product,neutral
"do not recommend for sensitive skin.. i wanted to like this product because it is clean and has really good reviews, but it made my sensitive skin really angry. i should have known when it had a scent to it that it would not work. i used it at night before bed and woke up with red bumps all over my skin and as the day went on my skin felt extremely itchy and got more bumpy. unfortunately, i could not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.",negative
"i wanted to like this product because of the price and since i like some other innisfree products, but unfortunately i am very disappointed in this sunscreen. it is my least favorite sunscreen of the asian sunscreens i have tried so far. cons- why is it so thick? the texture of this sunscreen is very unpleasantly gloopy kind of reminds me of elmers glue as a kid and while it does not leave a whitecast it is still annoyingly hard to blend into my pale skin.- pretty sure it is comedogenic due to how thick the texture is and after a week of use i am getting some pimples and breakout clusters along my forehead and cheeks usually i have pretty clear skin- low spf and i am sure it is actually even lower than the rating advertised. after all the scandals and studies i always assume there is a point difference. given how low it is i think it is only suitable during the winter at best pros- affordable especially compared to a lot of other popular asian sunscreens- does not sting around the eyes- dries down with a silky texture not glowy and not matte either- depending on your preference this can be a pro or a con- no negative differences when reapplying. just have the same issues as the first application of the texture being too thick and difficult to blend into the face- mild and not overpowering fragrance- super thick texture could be good for those who want extra layersmoisture in the winter. but for me, it did not feel moisturizing as much as it felt heavy and gloopy....i was hoping for better!! so far, the thank you farmer sunscreen with spf is still my go to but it is! i wanted to like this for the price point but it is just not worth it with the low spf and poor texture. please, innisfree, come out with a better formula! your brand is usually reliable and affordable good skincare should not have to break the bank",negative

"i liked the packaging and there was a decent amount of product. i usually use about one or two pumps for my whole face. i like to mix it into my moisturizer for added redness relief. or, my own personal little life hack, i actually enjoy using this serum and a facial razor to get rid of peach fuzz! it is very delicate and i notice my skin feeling so much better when i shave with this serum versus without it, plus the redness after shaving goes away a lot faster! overall, pretty good. if it was a little stronger i would give it stars immediately, but it does help with redness.",positive

"absolutely incredible. went on accutane a few years back but i still occasionally break out, especially with new products. this serum is my go to when i need to calm downget rid of any breakouts, it is been so great for adding moisture without the heaviness of most moisturizing face products. would definitely recommend, run out to get this!",positive
"sephora is making really great rides in their newest launch of affordable clean skin care. so far i have enjoyed a couple products from the line that are up to par. this gel cleanser is trying, but it has not quite reached its full potential. i did appreciate the gel texture while it did remove some makeup it did not remove all makeup and it says that it can be a double cleanse, i disagree with that. i believe this could be step one in a double cleanse maybe. i really appreciate that this is clean beauty, vegan and the packaging material is sustainable.",neutral
i love that this cream is fragrance free. it comes out of the tube as a cream and the instructions are that you need to rub your hands together before applying and this will make the cream oily. i have dry and sensitive skin and i just flare up whenever i use it on my face. might not be suited for my face bit it makes a good hand cream!,neutral

i actually do not think it is working well. i have stubborn blackheads in my t zone area that just will not seem to go away. i have used this a few times and it just does not seem to be making any difference. i love to so i wanted to love this. i would still recommend because i have friends that still benefit from it,neutral

". stars, would not repurchase. pros- moisturize skin, it sucks it right up- good base before wearing makeup- smells nice- good productcons- expensive cuz its just a moisturizer, could get something better for cheaper- fragrance is not necessary and too much- i am not a fan of the product in a jar, unsanitary if i use it everyday",neutral

"this product only has bad ratings because of the comparisons to an old formula, which i have never tried. i can, however, compare it to it cosmetics cc cream and oil-free bye bye foundation. supergoop is slightly thinner so it is easier for me to blend on my face. i noticed with it cosmetics, the color is different for every single tube in the light shade... and subtle color differences make a huge difference in the overall appearance of your face. they have about the same coverage between the two brands. i like supergoop far more than it cosmetics due to how much easier it is for me to blend it out and also how much longer it stays on my face compared to it cosmetics supergoop also seems to bring out more vibrance to my skin and makes me look amazing! i have super oily skin, enlarged pores and dry patches this cc screen does not emphasize any of those and actually keeps my oiliness in control which plays a role in my foundation lasting a lot longer.",positive
"amazing product, i love it. my skin looks so much better. i received this product as a sample and became very obsessed with the product. highly recommend!!",positive
"i got a small bottle of this in a gift set. the smell was great, but that was the only noticeable positive. it worked about as well as any standard cleanser. i have to admit, i am not a fan of the branding- it feels hipstery and disingenuous. i mean, kale??",neutral
"the formula separated, even when i tried to shake it before use. after about uses, the pump stopped working, and now i cannot even pump anything out of it. so frustrating and a waste of money. the scent was floral and nice.. i am going to try to return it.",negative
i love the drunk elephant line but this product dried my skin out badly and caused discoloration around my mouth. after i stopped using this bar my skin went back to normal after- days of deep hydration and care.,neutral
"so when i got this long way back, i loved it! used it every day and saw my hyperpigmenation reduced. i ended up moving to because and used it there and broke out from it after each use. it was like tiny white lil pimples. i had to discontinue use. i moved back to my current city so i might try it again. but ladies, i found two good alternatives i have been using if this does not work.. alpha arbutin ha. let me tell you this works soo good! also, use the txa from inky list which also helped reduce dark spots!",neutral
"this mask is just ok. i have been using it times a week for months now and i cannot say that i notice much of a difference. i love the color and texture of the mask and it is fun to apply but for, i would not recommend.",neutral
i typically do not have sensitive skin but this product made my under eye drier and eventually gave me bumps on my under eye. i used it on and off for a few weeks hoping it would adjust or something. looking for something extra hydrating now to fix what this caused. also noticed a lot of separation of the cream in the jar over the few weeks. unfortunately a let down for me.,negative
"tiktok made me buy it. used it on alternating days so i do not mix with retinol. horribly dried out my skin, had to use so much moisturizer that my skin started to break out, i have very clear skin normally. stopped both retinal and peptides, three weeks later tried to reintroduce the peptides again by itself, same thing with irritation. waste of money",negative
i have dry skin. this product did not provide any moisture in fact it felt more drying. i also did not notice any glow from the product which was the part i was most excited about. when applying the lotion it feels more like paste like texture similar to applying sunscreen.,negative
love this mask! i am a nurse who works nights and is always tired and this mask brightened my eyes right up! like magic no more puffiness and my dark circles have faded! will buy again and again,positive
i really liked the feel of this cream it was not too heavy or runny perfect balance.,neutral
stars because i know it is a good product but it was def not for me! super thick and heavy moisturizer it made my skin break out right away and my makeup just slid off my face the two days i used it. definitely not for a combination skin person.,neutral
"i knocked off two stars for the ridiculous price. the product does work fairly well. i have issues with large pores on my nose and poreswrinklestexture between my eyebrows. it has not really made a difference on my nose but the space between my brows does definitely look improved. it does leave a residue, so i only use it at night. some people have mentioned an awful smell. there is a smell, but it does not bother me and will not keep me from using it. i do feel like it is overpriced for the results...you are paying a lot for elaborate packaging. i would been using samples but finally bought the full size during the vib sale when the price was more reasonable.",neutral
"i received a sample of this from influenster and estee lauder, and with such a small window to test the product and writing my review, all i can say is the product is fine. i did not hate it and it did not irritate my eye area, but i would not go out of my way to purchase it. while it is nice and lightweight and absorbed well, i just prefer my eye creams to be a tad thicker. i do not expect instant results but it does not appear to have even made a hint of an impact on my dark circles. and while it did absorb well, because of its consistency, i did not feel like the area remained hydrated long enough. i also wish it did not have a scent since the product is used on my face.",neutral
"first of all, i am a huge drunk elephant fan and loyal customer, this brand never disappoints. the product i was gifted is an oil-serum retinol. i have been using this oil serum for about weeks now every night on its own than an oil free moisturizer afterwards, and boy has my skin changed in the best way possible! i have acne prone, oily, discoloration, along with acne scarring. to be honest i was very hesitant to use this oil when i first recieved it because i am very oily to begin with and do not use oils too often, but boy was i wrong. this beautiful oil-serum literally melts right into your skin within minutes! not to mention has given me such a beautiful glow that lasts all day. it did not irritate my skin at all whatsoever either. it has dramatically improved my scarring and discoloration! i am so happy to have been gifted this because my skin was in such a horrible place weeks ago and now i have never been so confident without makeup! gloeidays complimentary drunkelephant influenster",positive
"was a good product, really showed results. very much recommend.",neutral
very expensive still bought it after seeing wonderful reviews. this product did not do anything for me very disappointed,negative
this did not do anything great for my skin. my biggest dislike is how heavy it is and how greasy and tacky my face felt after applying. it was horrible trying to sleep with it. also made my pores feel clogged. i liked the consistency and how it sorta helped with mild texturedryness but that is really it.,negative
"i have used a few of drunk elephants products and have enjoyed a couple of them but overall, the best thing about drunk elephant is probably the packaging and not what is actually inside. everything looks cool and the irrational consumer in my wants to buy all the colorful items. i also find myself falling for the marketing with the suspicious ordeal. but let me tell you, this product did nothing for me. the product marketed itself as being effective for uneven skin tone and there was zero difference for me. i do not deal with acne or dull skin thankfully so i cannot comment on that but i really do not understand the hype behind this product. i have found other better priced glycolic acid products to be much more effective. this is not worth the price to me. i also really find that de is a bit disingenuous at times. i have noticed that anytime consumers complain about a certain product adversely impacting their skin, their response is something along the lines of stop using other products that have the suspicious and use our stuff only. i hate that one product should be able to stand on its own. furthermore, it is interesting that they have built the entire brand around these suspicious but they definitely use ingredients such as fruit extracts that could be bothersome to users.",negative
"i am a tactupump user... and this stung my skin and did not really help with adding moisture to my skin. however, the consistency of this cleanser is beautiful and i love how it basically melts onto your face! i will probably return to this product after i finish using tactupump!",neutral
"i got this as a free sample with an online order. i have combo skin that tends to lean way more towards dry. my skin also used to be acne prone but i will maybe get or pimples every two months now. my skin was feeling particularly dry the day i used this. i love the water cream so i figured this could be a better option during the winter months. i used a very small amount and it felt like i would slathered my face in vaseline. after only a few hours, i noticed or cystic zits pop up and it clogged my pores. nothing else was different about my skincare routine that day aside from this. it just felt gross. i am glad that i tried this before spending my money on it.",negative
"this was the first luxury retinol product i tried, and i liked it a lot. some of the drugstore options at the time did not sit well on my skin or were irritating. i did not experience any of that with de, and it helped with hormonal acne, both in healing and dealing with redness and dark marks. drugstore products have come a long way since then, and at a fraction of the cost...so i am going back. if you have money to burn this is a great option. otherwise you will get more bang for your buck elsewhere.",neutral
"this product is wonderful. i have been barely washing my face because i am starting to use retinol regularly. this cleanser is fantastic for sensitive skin, or for anyone just looking for a gentle cleanse. it still has some texture to give you the sense that you are cleaning your skin, but it is not harsh at all. i will repurchase this forever",positive
"great face wash! i have combination skin at started to see enlarging pores. i have tried other face washes with aha other ingredients for exfoliating, but did not see much of a difference. i only use this one at night, and over the last- weeks, i can see a change. it leaves my skins clean without feeling stripped. will definitely continue to use but again.",positive
"i did not realize the product would be so small! i bought this because i watched the video about application and saw that it could be used before andor after make-up application. it feels a little greasysticky. when applying after make-up, i see my foundation on the sunscreen so it is removing it a bit.",neutral
"i ignored the negativity regarding the packaging because the product itself was such a draw and good, actually. but... aside from the mess, the package cannot stand up, and the outside of the package flakes onto your hands? honestly surprised that there is so much agreement among reviewers and not a move right away to put this package on clearance and a new version on pump--or tube--or anything but this.",neutral
"just started using this product for my acne scars and will be totally honest, i have not seen a big change yet. really hoping these reviews are truly honest. i have had a few scars from years ago including an ice pick one from th grade. but that is the least one i am concerned about. i mostly want the darker spots of my acne scars to clear up. i will give it more time of course but just wanted to say zero sign of improvement so far. will return to update my review.",negative
"this is a great face wash for sensitive and dry skin. it is very gentle and does not feel like it strips my skin of natural moisture, while still making me feel fresh and clean. the consistency is nice, almost like a very thin gel, and it has a very slight foam without being drying. i also like the glasspump packaging. definitely my new go to for cleanser.",positive
it is hard as a darker skin person to find sunscreen that does not make me look casket ready... until this beauty here! i have oily skin and it does not make me super shiny. the product melts into the skin when massaged in properly. it is lightweight and non-greasy. i love the fact this is a facial and body sunscreen. it is a chemical sunscreen so you have to keep up with reapply or you will be sol down the line.,positive
broke me out after using it for a couple of days!,negative
"honestly, i do not know how this product has so many positive reviews. i really disliked the experience of using this cleansing balm. it was impossible to wash off my face. i had to double cleanse even when i was not planning to, simply to get all the balm off. not only that, but it did not even remove my waterproof mascara! returned this product and i am going back to my expensive holy grail product- tatcha camellia cleansing oil. that stuff is amazing, i just wish it was a bit cheaper.",negative
"made me break out a lot. i had to stop using it. heard it was common for sensitive skin, which i have...",negative
such a beautiful oil! i am seeing a difference already!,positive
"i was trying to add a toner to my routine and i am a fan of the glow recipe avocado serum so i thought i would give this a try. however i was left disappointed, the toner is sticky and the smell is not pleasant but beyond that it made me breakout. i assumed it was just purging so i continued using but the breakouts persisted, until i stopped use. my skin can be sensitive but and breakout but it is usually clear, this may work if you already acne but otherwise there is no point. i also noticed no difference in my pores.",negative
"while it did prevent sunburn, it accentuated my fine lines and felt gross on my skin. i recommend something else if you have dry to normal skin.",negative
"this is a really nice toner that does what it claims to do. i love the well-pump it has for application, you just place a cotton pad over it and press down, usually one to two pumps is enough for me. i have been using this every morning and night for weeks and the bottle is still more than three quarters full. it does not have a fragrance as listed under the ren clean skincare label along with other things it does not have. it offers very gentle exfoliation on my drycombination aging skin and even completely got rid of some tiny flesh colored bumps i was starting to get under my eyes, which surprisingly did not irritate the surrounding eye area. my skin does feel a little bit sticky after application, but nothing too bothersome. it really gets rid of any remaining dirt and dead skin cells after washing my face. i have also noticed an actual glow with continued use of this product. i have a lot of little dark hyperpigmentation spots from a deep laser resurfacing treatment i had a year ago and am trying out everything to see what works on them. i think this does make my skin more even toned, but i am also currently using korres wild rose vitamin c oil and their moisturizers that claim to lighten dark spots. either way, i will continue to buy this toner as i find it does not dry out my skin like other toners i have tried before and it makes my skin feel nice and look healthier.",positive
i had beautiful skin. always fresh clean. used this i broke out!!! extremely disappointed would never use again. i will stick to the ordinary products,negative
"i received this product free for testing purposes from influenster and tatcha. after trying this product out for a few weeks, i can honestly say that this is a must-have in your skincare regimen. i was suffering from severe dry skin thanks to this winter weather, and this product has worked absolute wonders. it keeps my face hydrated without giving me an oily face afterward. this is an absolute plus in my book.",positive
perfect for my sensitive skin. does not dry me out and my face feels balanced and clean. works perfectly with the precleanse. wish i found this ages ago.,positive
wow! this is such an amazing luxurious moisturizer. it honestly goes on like buttery velvet and sinks in quickly leaving skin soft smooth and hydrating without greasiness. i do dots one on the forehead two on the cheeks and one on the chin and rub it all in so that it is even. i was worried when i used this because i have very acne prone skin and my skin breaks out often when i try new moisturizers but i have used this over weeks and i have no new acne! so is say if you are nervous about using a thicker cream i would say this one is a safe one for us acne babes! i was nervous because of the shea butter ingredient but just trust me this is the good good. also it will probably last you your entire mortal life you need so little. so the price actually is justified for me. if you are on the fence this is me telling you through the screen this is the beat moisturizer i have ever used and a good moisturizer makes a big difference to your moisturizer skin barrier. and i use a lot of exfoliating products i need to protect it well.,positive
"wanted a hydrating, depuffing, firming product. this is not it. use it nightly. no difference. decent moisture, but not worth it at this price point. what is up with the positive ratings?",negative
"i have used moisturizers from sephora and this one seems a little sticky for some reason. it might be reacting bad with something else in my skin care routine?regardless, it makes my eyelids stick together and is not the most hydrating for me.",neutral
i bought this product in the hope that it will improve the texture of my skintone but after over a month of using it twice a day my skin is still as rough and patchy and as bad as it was the day i placed the order. if you are looking for someting that will improve the texture of your skin and smoothens it this is not the product for you. please do not waste your money on this.,negative
"in general, my skin responds well to pretty much any products with pretty much any ingredients l-ascorbic acid, retin a, ahas, bhas... but this one really dried out my skin. maybe pga itself is a good ingredient for hydrating your skin, but this particular product does not do the trick.",negative
these drops work wonderfully for a nice glow! they help when used underneath primer and foundation as well. i also felt comfortable fresh faced and that is a wonderful feeling! this is an incentivized campaign post and i received the product complimentary for testing purposes,positive
"omg, first of, packaging as always is sooo pretty, second, the color of product is cocoa brown gives you some magical vibe- indigo- feels very exclusive, third- texture- the summer is over and winter and autumn are coming so it is perfect- it is thick, but it sinks into yr skin and skin feels protected from harm, it is very nourishing and moist but also feels like the right amount of heavy... i even might use it as a day cream too, because oh well, it seems to be amazing to wear when it is windy and frosty- in winter. anyways, tatcha always delivers its quality to the highest standards and i am very happy to try this cream.",positive
"this is a really thick balm but it does emulsify really well. i find that taking it off with a makeup remover cloth. its great for a first cleanse, but also a second cleanse. its good on sensitive skin and does not leave the skin tight or irritated. such a great cleanser",positive
"this has changed my skin for the better. i have tried so many retinols and retinol alternatives and i just did not notice any difference. i have been using this retinol for over a year now and i will never go back. my forehead lines are reduced, my pigmentation has gone down and my acne is minimal.",positive
love this niacinamide serum. works great for me. i have tried other brands but keep coming back to this one.,positive
i am in love with this serum! i suffer from consistent acne on my chin and the corners of my mouth and jawline as well as blackheadscongested pores around my nose. i got this serum days ago and have been using it every night since my skin is very used to high strength aha products otherwise i would not recommend doing this. since i have started using this i have had no new pimples which is unheard of for me and the congested pores and blackheads have smoothed out considerably. my skin is absolutely glowing and looks better than it has in years!!,positive
i hated the product and only used it twice. it is gritty and grainy and burns my skin.,negative
"honestly one of the best spot treatments i have ever used! never dries out my skin i have dryish cheeks an oily t-zone, but works wonders on calming, flattening, and eventually disappearing stubborn pimples, including cystic acne! a little bit goes a long way so although the bottle looks small, you will get a ton of uses out of it!",positive
very gentle moisturizer. i have been enjoying applying in the morning before makeup and it gives a beautiful base that is super lovely. the fragrance is great so ni complaints with that. i might repurchase again in a smaller size. gifted by laneige.,positive
"great cleanser. exfoliating and cleansing, yet does not strip your skin and leave it feeling super dry. i do not have acne much, but i noticed this cleanser helps keep my skin clear from clogged pores and pimples.",positive
"i got this as a deluxe sample in the sun safety kit months ago so i wanted to wait to review this until i tried it a few times. no matter how i prep it, with or without anything, it just just too greasy! it never settled in and it did not protect me from getting burnt. i do not recommend this to anyone with combo skin that is fair skinned.",negative
"i purchased this product because of the really good reviews. i have been using this for the past weeks now and although the initial application feels nice and smooth, it has not been working for me. my pores seem a slight bit smaller but other than that i have been breaking out a lot more than usual and noticed tiny little bumps all over my forehead and cheeks. overall i do not get all the hype of this product and people saying they notice a different overnight. everyone is skin is different and this will not work for everyone.",negative
i really want to love this product but it has not made a significant difference on my hyperpigmentation or dark marks sadly,neutral
this is great for what it is and the price. i do not wear a ton of makeup but it does remove it all. it leaves a little bit of a balmy residue on my face but once i go in with a water based cleanser after it works great!,positive
"this product is a waste. it is over priced, the walls of the jar are actually very thick so you get way less than it looks like. it made no difference on my skin at all. this was my first and last tatcha product",negative
very very great product!!! feels great on dry skin and works miracles. strongly recommend!!,positive
hate it! i bought both.. the heavier one for when my skin gets drier. thought in the long run it would be great just to have a one step moisturizer.... i am happy taking all the steps for my skin,negative
"i received a sample complimentary from la mer. this is my first time trying creme de la mer moisturizer. i watched their instructional video that says to warm it for a few seconds between the fingers until it becomes translucent... i did this. my issue with this process is that it takes more than a few seconds and then good amount of the moisturizer is absorbed into my fingers. this is a huge waste, especially with this being a high end luxury product. once the moisturizer is warmed between your fingers you gently press it on to your face and neck. you are not supposed to rub it in or anything. it seems like a lot more product needs to be used this way. i do not agree at all that a little goes a long way. the product does hydrate very well. my skin feels soft after using creme de la mer moisturizer.",neutral
"i tried this for about two weeks and the hype pigmentation around my mouth would turn red and would start peeling. if anything i feel like it got darker, i am giving it three stars because i paired it with the vitamin c silicone suspension so i think that is what may have made it irritated. i tried using this alone after trying to take a break from it and began to break out. i hope it works for someone out there but my skin is just really sensitive as well!!",neutral
"i was super excited to try this serum but even after months of use i did not see any change, it did nothing for me that my other more affordable serums did not do. plus the sticky left over residue was not great",negative
got recommended this product when i was looking for a moisturizer for my sensitive skin while i was in store. i bought it and tried it out. in the beginning it was refreshing and moisturizing to the skin when i applied it at night. the next morning my skin was very dry to the point that there was flakes falling out from my face. i had to return this product because what is the point of having a moisturizer that dries your skin out even though it is said to moisturize?,negative
nice moisturizer. for the price i expected more. it is not miraculous but it is nice. if it were more in line with the prices of comparable creams i would give it stars.,neutral
i was like a zebra when i used it couple of times.,negative
i love the fresh and clean sent of this product and it does great at removing face makeup. but when it comes to eye makeup especially mascara it is not as powerful. i have to use another makeup remover to get all of it off.,neutral
"i normally love caudalie products- i use many of them regularly in my skincare routine so i was super excited to try this. unfortunately, this made my skin look like a greasy mess. i wanted to love it but i will stick with their other moisturizers instead!",negative
very greasy heavy. was not good for me. probably nice to wear in very cold climates or during tough winters.,negative
"so this product feels amazing on my skin, yes, but it does not last. i have really dry skin and when i put this on, it feels incredible. its like my skin is drinking water. however, the hydration does not last. i like to let my moisturizer sink into my skin before makeup, but after like minutes, my skin is dehydrated again. so i have to go in with a second moisturizer. i would not mind if this was drugstore price, but its not lol",neutral
"glad i bought the mini size, i have been using this and have not noticed any difference compared to the one i bought from my local drug store. i wanted to try this because of a famous youtuber sang it is praises, maybe it works for some people but it has done nothing for me.",negative
"i am happy with this product but will not repurchase. it is hydrating which is lovely, however the mist is not super fine which personally i would prefer for a more even distribution of product.",neutral
this is a potent aha toner and has lightened my dark spots after a month. however it is quite drying and stings my face too much if i use it every day. i would suggest using every other day if you have sensitive skin. also there is heavy fragrance which i think is contributing to the irritation.,neutral
"it did not work for me. my skin became irritated after applications. also, the price point is not worth it.",negative
"i received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. i wanted to love this, but it was just okay. for the price point of the product, i did not think that it did enough and i do not think that i would purchase it for myself. my skin feels a little bit more hydrated than when i do not use this spray, but i think that there are other products that can do the same thing for me... if not more at a more affordable price point. the product is okay, but not the best.",neutral
"i received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. i had a hard time liking this product. for something that goes on delicate skin, it is heavily fragranced at least for me. it does glide on smoothly but that is all that it has going for it. it provides minimal hydration and it bunched slightly under my concealer. the final result and feel is similar to tatchas the silk canvas. if you are someone that has crepey skin or fine lines around your eyes i would not recommend this product as it might amplify what you are trying to remedy.",neutral
this product makes no sense. you cannot get the product out of the container and when you do it is not moisturizing at all. will never buy again. i love all of their other products.,negative
i am so disappointed with this considering the rave reviews it has. i have dry skin and was looking for a new winter cream but this was sadly not it and i returned it. it felt nice when i first applied it but it made my skin feel so oily greasy i had to wash it off it was bothering me so much.,neutral
did not work at all!! used with stars by riley weeks no difference,negative
"this product is amazing! i definitely have some acne and have tried everything on the market. i am also super bad about picking my skin so i end up with some temporary scaring. applying this product- times a day has been working like a dream. unlike other spot treatments it is not drying at all, in fact i feel hydrated after applying it. within a day or two, even the worst pimples or scars are gone. i have truly never experienced a product which worked so fast.",positive
"this cleanser is nice, has lasted me a while. you only need a little bit to get the foaming started. it does dry out my skin sometimes though. especially during the winter.",positive
this did literally nothing for my skin. not worth the money i am going to,negative
"immediately after washing my face, i noticed little dry patches. this product will be returned as soon as possible.",negative
"i have been using this product for around months now, undecided whether i like it or not. at first i thought my skin needed to adjust, but i am still getting the same reaction. i would return if i could. my skin is mildly sensitive, and it can handle strong acids, but not this one for some reason. i do not find this to be as gentle as other acids i have tried. it works, and it is not the best acid i have used, but it compromises my skin barrier.",neutral
"i am obsessed with this cleanser. if you have not bought it, go buy it right now! it will do wonders for your face, and i know this because i have tried multiple different cleansers and this one is my favorite. i have drycombination skin, and also very sensitive skin as well and this cleanser has been perfect. it also helped me with my uneven texture and dark spots. i recommend this product to everyone",positive
"overall i am just not sure what this product is meant to do. i have been using the entire set and have seen a difference in my skin, but hard to notice if it is from this product. i feel very neutral about it, but have not felt as drawn to it as other items in the skincare line.",neutral
"i received this product for sample purposes and i love it!!! there is a reason why this serum is so popular and it is because it delivers! i love this formula way more than the original because i saw immediate results! after first use, i woke up to radiant hydrated skin that looked so effortlessly healthy! i have been using it consistently for a week now as i have nothing bad to say. totally worth the investment",positive
"i tried this as a sample and wanted to love it, but it makes me look silver. the silver even comes through after i have layered other products over it. it is very subtle, but still. should not have to worry about things like that in this day and age. sucks when a brand just does not make something for an entire group of people and i have only heard great things about this product so i thought i should say something. i am syracuse in nars foundation, so i am not even the darkest person out there and when i am even darker in the summer months, this is just..... not happening.",negative
had a sample size of this and had to throw it out star half of the bottle was used up. i hate wasting product but my skin could not handle it anymore. it was too drying. even with good moisturizer. i had flakey dry patches all over my cheeks and chin. did not pay attention to my t-zone that usually gets really oily because i was so focused on getting rid of the dry patches. the acne time release is less drying and helped my skin if this is also too drying for someone else. giving it stars- star for the price and- star because it did not work my combination skin. just because it does not work for me does not mean it will not work for someone else. i could imagine someone with severe acne and super oily skin could use this with good results.,neutral
"it kept sliding off my under eye area while i was getting ready in the morning. it might be better to use at nighttime as an extra step in my routine. but then, i want less puffy eyes in the morning. overall, i was not impressed.",neutral
"used the entire bottle. no noticeable changes. better than other creams i have tried though origins ginzeng, shiesedo",neutral
"all made up, and filtered pics aside, this stuff is amazing! my skin is severely oily, and i have tried everything from olay to lancome to clarsonic, but nothing has yielded these results since the original proactiv completely changed formula since then, and the original bare minerals combination also completely changed formula which yes, was once marketed, and indeed worked as makeup that cleared skin! in just three uses my under skin acne is almost gone, and pores almost completely clear. i am in complete shock that finally after well over a decade of searching, and wasting countless dollars something delivers again. sunday riley, and tatcha used to work fine enough not great, but again, both have changed formulas like everything else for whatever reason so i have been desperately trying to find something without having to turn to, and rely on the hefty cost of laser treatments. i have found it! i am overjoyed. if you have high maintenance skin, try this. if you can invest in your skincare do not pass this. start with the milder formulas first if you are not all, but plagued by your skin, but, if you suffer from large pores, visible clogging, acne, andor extreme oil production, you owe this to yourself to at least try the trial.",positive
"i hated it, felt like it did not even clean my face, also it separates weirdly. could not even finish the bottle.",negative
this product really works i could see outstanding results within a week i have minimal textured oily skin and this product is a game changer for my skin.,positive
after seeing people rave about this is hated it. it made my face super sticky feeling and broke me out.,negative
"really wanted to love this but i did not find it to be deeply moisturizing at all. first time using a moisturizer where my skin still felt tight from dryness and had visible flakes, but my entire face was greasy. not sure if it takes some getting used to or i am using incorrectly but really did not work for me. also, like others said you get very little product in the mini. maybe tablespoon of product.",neutral
"i am so glad i tried a sample before i purchased. all the reviews make it seem like it is a miracle serum, and maybe it is for dry skin, but not for my oily skin. i thought it would be greasy but surprisingly, it is not- it goes on greasy and then dries very very quickly is it the alcohol?. i like the smell though. i put it on my face and the next day, woke up with a giant pimple on my chin. i thought, maybe it is just my skin acting up i do not get pimples very often, so i waited a few days, and tried it again. this time, a weird bump on my cheek, sort of like a simple. i did not change any other thing in my skincare routine except for this oil. bummer.",negative
one of my top cleansers.. very gentle but powerful it really gives you a satisfying cleanse. very lush and creamy. not the best smell but who cares fragrance free,positive
"this product definitely lives up to what it claims to do. it gives you a beautiful dewy look with a flawless complexion. this is perfect for when you want that fresh summer hydrated look. however, if you over do it you can look very greasy so apply lightly then more if you require it! i also find it to be quite thick on the skin but i do not mind it.",positive

it did not strip my skin and lathered nicely but i could not get over the baby powder smell. it is completely overpowering and lingers.,neutral
this does nothing for my skin. i have been using it for over a month to see if it would help over time.. short answer is no.,negative
"i really wanted to love this product! my initial impressions were that it is very luscious, thick, and creamy. great scent. and vitamin c! all wonderful attributes. unfortunately, this just never seems to sink into my skin. each time i apply it, no matter how much or how little i apply, it turns into a layer of grease on my skin. i spend the rest of the day walking around with the feeling of an uncomfortable oil slick on my face and neck. eventually it starts to pill up. all in all not a good situation. once i gave up on this product, i did give the other half of the container to my friend, who says it is the best moisturizer she is ever had. so maybe this is really specific to each person. hence the stars! for reference, i have very dry skin.",neutral
"all my skincare products have been replaced with tatcha skincare. i am absolutely in love with this brand, and especially the rice wash cleanser. i never realized that rice was something my skin had been missing, but this cleanser has done my skin wonders. it is so easy to put on. i can just scrub with my fingers and i can already feel it working its way deep into my skin, and it rinses off so nice, that i just need to splash water onto my face or times, and then i am set. it does not leave my skin feeling rough, or a burning feeling afterwards. my skin feels smooth and soft. i do not breakout as much as i used to it, i do not even breakout really anymore. my redness has disappeared a lot. i love this cleanser.",positive
"this is my second jar. def thick enough for the winter. i do notice my skin has more glow to it after several weeks. as for dark spots old acne scars, i have not seen a difference after a year of using this.",neutral
"this stuff is a great dupe for la mer, it is a thick cream while still being lightweight and absorbs quickly. it is a great winter cream for drier skin. but omg the smell. it is terrible. it is hard to describe, i think they were going for an icy scent but it is like floral play dough. it is so bad that i am tempted to not purchase again but the moisturization might be worth it!",neutral
"i got this product for free, and even so it did not change my views on this product. i usually do not breakout, but this made me breakout. one really bad pimple stayed for a while a left a dark spot. did not see a huge different in my pores. also, it kind of smells and had the consistency of rubbing alcohol.",negative
i love this sunscreen. got a mini size in another set i bought and then bought full size after using. it smells great and makes my skin feel great too. does not make me break out like other sunscreens either. it is not greasy and does not leave my skin greasy either. this is a must have for outdoors! love this product!!,positive
i already have tons of great products for my face but want to get a head start in preventing aging on my hands. lots of hand creams out there but anti aging? not so much. so check this out. these kinds of serums are awesome for your hands!! use this product every night before you go to bed and within a couple weeks your hands will look amazing. i am going to try inkey list for other stuff too. what a great brand and inexpensive.,positive
"i finish the whole bottle and did nothing for me, however, it smells divine and it does hydrate your skin.",negative
"i am torn, i actually like this serum, goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly ready for a moisturizer. but... the smell! it is horrific. it is like chocolate had a really bad day and was not wearing deodorant.",neutral
i really wanted to love this product- i had heard so much good about it! but it was not good for my skin. i have very dry skin and this actually dried me out more- my skin started flaking in spots- and broke me out terribly in other spots.,negative
"it is pretty calming for the most part i had very dry but acne prone skin and it helped without burning other than around my nose which was the driest. i cannot see it being any better than another moisturizer with the same benefits though. something that bothered me more than anything was the fragrance though, it smells pretty bad! i usually am able to get around the smell of products or they fade i can appreciate the ingredients for the most part but i wish if anything they did not add any fragrance at all! leaves you looking a bit shiny too. i received this as a sample so it was nice to try out.",positive
this product is amazing! i see a lot of people complaining about the smell it is not strong at all and due to the ingredients it would make sense why there is a scent. saw result with in a month best on tge market!,positive
"this product broke me out, i tried it a few months later and it still broke me out yet again. i really wanted to enjoy this product because i heard very good things about it but sadly it did not workout for me. smells great though lol. gave me red itchy bumps on my face and a lot of irritation.",negative
i finished a whole bottle and did not notice any brightening. also it does not give enough hydration and leaves some glittery color on my skin.,negative
"got a deluxe sample of this in hopes of finding a better moisturizer, but this made my face break out and left it greasy! my oily skin did not like this one bit!",negative
"i received a complimentary sample from influenster in exchange for an honest review. i had high hopes for this clarins product and it is anti-aging benefits as i am in my s. i have combination skin and this product claimed it worked with all skin types. it does not. it felt heavy on my skin, without feeling moisturizer, and caused break outs fairly quickly. those with dry skin andor in greater need of anti-aging may find it meets their needs, but i would not use this product if you have combination or acne-prone skin.",negative
i use this overtop of my medical grade retinol and it works amazing. it prevents my breakouts and gives me class skin,positive
"does not completely clear out pores and eliminate blackheads, but works pretty well! always makes my skin feel refreshed and glowy. great value for the price.",positive
i love this moisturizer. it absorbs into my skin wonderfully and feels lightweight enough to use every day. my boyfriend is also now a fan of this moisturizer because the fragrance is not overwhelming. it works just as well for his skin which is more oily as it does for my skin which is on the dry side.,positive
"i would not reccomend this moisturizer. the moisturizer feels like a normal everyday moisturizer from the drugstore for like bucks. for reference my routine is cleanser, a hydrating toner, serum, a face oil, and this moisturizer. the moisturizer does not last for longer than a few hours even when kayered with other hydrating products.i take care to introduce products one at a time and give them the best shot at working. i even switched from my salicylic acid cleanser to my hylauronic acid cleanser and it still did not come close to being as moisturizing as claimed. the fact that this teeny moisturizer does not keep my skin moisturized after a hydrating toner and a hydrating face oil shows me that it is not very effective.",negative
"does not work for me at all.first of all, the texture is not waterymoisturizing. when applied on face, there is no this intense hydration feeling.also it is very very sticky, which can be a trouble as a night time product.and for the nest morning my face feels dry.",negative
"i really wanted to like this product especially because of the high price point, but every time i used it i had terrible breakouts all over my face.",negative
"i was really excited about this mask after reading the reviews, seeing this mask as one that targeted literally every concern i have. it was not bad, but it was not everything i expected based off reviews and product info either.....the mask is a fun one....from the color to the scent to the overall feeling. even washing it off is fun because it lathers as it rinses. and it does leave my skin feeling fresh, about the same as it feels after you brush your teeth that minty cool feel.as for results.....i did not really see any differences. maybe because i already have some tried true masks that minimize clear out pores, control oil, etc....but this one was just okay. i do notice a slight difference in the amount of shine on my face the day i use this, but since it is not recommended daily it does not help the days in between. i notice if i leave this on longer than like mins, i swear my face feels more textured....like it over-dried out my face. i have to moisturize a lot more afterwards if that happens. do i hate it? no not at all....but i will not spend to re-purchase either. i would rather just stick to the masks i am using now.",neutral
"please please please do not get this. i got the big jar of this and every time i used it for two weeks my eyes and eye area would burn. plus my fine lines came out more visible than ever before, it really made me feel insecure. worst eye cream i have ever encountered ever.",negative
proven formula really works. this product is clean and free of fragrance.,positive
"let me start by saying in general i love the ordinary products. i use buffett and the rose hip seed oil religiously and am very satisfied. i just wanted to write a review in case there are other sensitive skins girls out there to proceed- this was just way too harsh for me and caused a rash on my face. i am happy to see it worked for other people, but if you have sensitive skin you may want to think twice.",neutral
"these really did not do much of anything for me. it is like putting on an eye cream and that is it. i have tried them several times now and have yet to notice any assistance in hydrating, de-puffing, or removing of dark circles. will not repurchase.",negative
horrible.. smells terrible does not lather up my face felt like i did not wash it.. skip this,negative
"i received this product as a gift from peter thomas roth. i love that the niacinimide is in a cream form instead of a serum. i feel like it sinks in easier and protects better. i was having a major issue with a deep area of acne forming on my cheek and a few acne breakout turned into one big deep cyst and ended up having a dark spot once it went away, but this treatment really helped in fading the scarring and redness on my cheek area as well as helping with the texture of that part of my skin. i definitely would recommend if you have acne scarring as a help to reduce it!",positive
i love this cream! i swear my skin looks younger in the morning after using this overnight! it is not too heavy on your skin and it smells nice and fresh.,positive
amazing primer with a smoothing effect and is truly unseen even with such a high spf protection- which is great! this-in- product is really worth it.,positive
"i received a complimentary week sample size from influenster. to be able to give a full review i would need to be able to use the product for at least- months. first impression is that the packaging is nice and it has a decent smell. it has not caused a reaction yet, but it is only been a few days so i cannot be sure. i would never purchase on my own as it is too expensive.",neutral
it is nice this was so cheap because it did absolutely nothing. this was my first and last attempt with this brand.,negative
"this product has made a huge difference in my skin. i have normal to oily skin, with minimal breakouts and this made my skin look and feel so radiant. recommend.",positive
"i was on the drunk elephant hype train... and still am to some extent. i truly loved this moisturizer when i first found it. it was the first moisturizer that was not prescribed by my dermatologist that i really felt made a difference. my skin felt so hydrated! i have been using drunk elephant for a good- months now and it is starting to wear on me. i am a bit of a creature of habit, so switching my skincare is not always ideal to me, but de has not been cutting it for me lately. my skin has been feeling oily with application. i guess my own personal experience would say this is great to try for a while, but switch it up after months or so to something new and maybe return back to de after. great product though!",positive
this burnt my face and made my eyes twitch??? very scary!,negative
"guys, please look up your ingredient before purchasing!! methyl alcohol should not be going on your skin. i am shocked that tarte would put this stuff in a bottle and ship it for profit. please please please do a search on methyl alcohol also called methanol. scientific reports confirming that it damages, dries, and cracks skin, can cause blindness, vapors will lead to dizziness, etc.",negative
i was really excited about this product but then i wanted to return it... i decided to stick with it and have seen some visible brightness in my skin after a week of use. pros- purchased for off not as irritating as other highly concentrated vitamin c products does not burnsaw a significant improvement to skin brightness after a few days. cons-i would not pay full price for this product when i can mix vitamin c into other products myself and it is much cheaper.-the orange smell make it feel cheap to me-my skin peelssloughs off if i use this under makeup or with any silicone products,neutral
"this product will definitely diminish the size of your pimple quickly- however, it is important to keep in mind that the product is strong stuff! it began to peel my skin after days of use. i think there are other products that could help you achieve rapid acne relief in a less abrasive way!",neutral
"i have been using this for maybe weeks now to test out. i have got to say, this stuff works. it plumps up my skin, leaves me hydrated all day, and has been minimizing my fine lines and pores. works great under makeup as well. i will definitely be repurchasing this once i run out.",positive
"i honestly do not understand why this is rated so high this uses i believe sugar molecules for the exfoliating effect which dissolve within a matter of- seconds that basically makes this product completely worthless in my opinion because it does not do its main purpose of exfoliating for that reason. the smell is not terrible, however i do not think it smells like natural strawberries if anything it smells too sweet and personally i am turned off by things that smell too sweet like candy for example when it comes to anything i am putting on my face. as for the formula outside the sugar molecules or whatever it is in there which dissolved, i would say this feels a bit like it leaves a residue on my skin...not sure if it is an oil or what, but i have oily skin to begin with, and that really does not feel like it is helping my skin in any way either. i tried contacting the fresh company about a week ago regarding wanting to return this product after about- uses, and i still have yet to hear back from them. very disappointed with both this product and lack of response from the company.",negative
"i think it protects well in the sun- but- if you get this in your eyes, sweat rolling down your brow at the poolbeach, it burns insanely. texture is also very oily and my skin feels greasy even after hours of application face and body. you also need to shake the bottle before applying as it separates. i initially liked a sample of this for face wear every day but it does not hold up in all settings and is too messy to consider for extended outdoor activities without having a backup for your face instead. smell is very strong as well, it does not fade and i wish it would as well. i wish i liked this product more for the cost but i would say skip it. does not bother any of my acne on face or body, i have sensitive oily skin that is acne prone.",neutral
this mask caught my interest because it does not have to be on for long. it has a color shifting aspect and warming sensation. i like that it left my skin feeling refreshed and clean with just enough hydration unlike most masks that leave my skin feeling too dry. gifted by tatcha.,positive
i strongly dislike this. it does not lather up well and i always feel like i have to use another cleanser in the evening. even using only this cleanser my face feels dry afterwards.,negative
this product is perfect for treating pcos acne. i have always struggled with finding a product that gets rid of my stubborn hormonal acne and this product does the trick. i have also found that since using this product i have been touching my face a lot less. i would highly recommended this product to everyone!!,positive
i liked this product. i felt like it decreased my pore size as well. i recently started using prescription retinol and i think this might have worked better. i am going to continue using the retinol for a few more months but will probably go back to this product.,positive
"first night using it-wow!! i was hesitant to try it at first all i can picture was me going to bed with this unnatractive, gaudy mask on my face-no thanks! anyways, my skin absorbed it immediately and i can see the glow right away and the puffiness under my eyes dissipate perfect for long exhausted nights. i received a small jar in one of the sephora favourite boxes i this is the one product, i can see myself paying full price for. a little goes a long way...",positive
gave this product to try because of course tiktok made me buy it. my first reaction was it burns. as suggested i tried mixing it with my moisturizer but even then it did not help. i tried it for a couple days in one week and gave up because it was just too strong.,negative
i wish i had received more of this product complimentary from la mer because the trial size i was given to test was not enough to see any results. it feels luxurious going on but i did not see any difference in my skin,neutral
"i have combination skin, oily t-zone and the rest of my face can sometimes feel really tight and dry. previously i was using a drug store hydro boost and i really liked it. it hydrated my skin just perfectly to not make me oily but drench the dry areas. thought this one would be better since it cost way more. unfortunately it is not as hydrating. i have to apply a good amount to hydrate my face. i like that it is light weight but my makeup will crack on my face if i do not add enough. not what i expected for the price.",neutral
it is okay! light weight hydrating does have a light scent of watermelon then goes into the scent of sunscreen which i am not a fan of. it is a small size for the price i am going to.,positive
i dislike this product immensely! i bought it to help balance my skin after the face wash i was using dried out my skin so bad moisturizing and exfoliating were not enough. i usually love clinique but not this product. i have combo skin and this actually seems to make it oilier after i wash my face. so much i have skipped moisturizing altogether. it does not balance nor does it clear my skin if anything i think it is breaking me out! it definitely leaves my face cloudy and i think it has a fragrance in it that is irritating my face. also with the lid shut it seems to be leaking from the bottle into the lid and actually seemed like it is half empty. it actually looked half full after st couple of uses and i do not use that much when i wash my face for it to look that way. super disappointed. and will not purchase again.,negative
"i love this cream before bed in the summer months, but it was not moisturizing enough for me during the winter.",neutral
"i keep this in my bathroom, obviously, and my hot showers shifted the formula. i hate it now",neutral
"i have been using the clinique balm for years, and was happy with that one...only complaint was that it did not come with a scoop. i tried out the drunk elephant version and was totally not impressed at all! the only redeeming quality was the handy magnetic scoop that attaches to the lid. i recently picked up this farmacy balm and i think it is better than my clinique staple. it effectively removes my mascara and eyeliner and has a very light and pleasant scent. plus, it comes with a scoop...i kept the plastic lid, so that i am able to lay the scoop inside after every use and wash. this is my new staple!",positive
i have been using this serum for a few months now and it has been the only product that i have truly committed to as part of a face routine. months in and the glow and supple feel of my skin after each use keeps me coming back. the best part my hyperpigmentation spots have noticeably faded. this product gives glow up a whole new meaning.,positive
wow this has become my go to moisturizer! i love finding skincare that is high quality but not expensive! this is a thinner formula but wow it really hydrates your skin! i cannot wait to try more skincare from this line!,positive
"i received a sample of this. it hydrated pretty well and provided a smooth canvas for makeup. it is not magic in anyway whatsoever, especially at this price point.",neutral
"when i read that this was a water cream, i thought it would be light and moisturizing, which i prefer in a facial cream. instead, i found it to be too heavy for my liking. i felt as if it was sitting on my face and not being absorbed into my skin. i did not enjoy using it.",neutral
"first off, i want to say i have been through a lot of different face washes. this is the first face wash that can not because my skin to break out, and works fast to clear any pimples that pop up randomly. i have combination skin, normal on cheeks, under eye, and chin, and super oily forehead and nose. this cleans my skin without stripping my skin. many face washes i tried would be good the first couple of days, and then completely break me out. unless something changes with my face, i will never stray from using this. i do not even want to experiment with other face washes even if they have super high reviews.",positive
"this is a nice product...i just do not think it is worth what they are charging, like most things these days. it had a nice, light tropical smell and left my face feeling very soft. i like the tiny exfoliating scrub, but i do not like how it turns almost like crumbled wet paper as washing. but i would continue to use it if it was more affordable.",neutral
perfect cleanser for dry acne prone skin. i tried over cleansers and this was the only one that left my skin dewy and moisturized. i switched to this tatcha wash skin softening cleanser and immediately noticed my acne clear up and skin feel dewy goes perfect with the dewy moisturizer!!,positive
"i tried this cleanser as a trial and i loved it. the scent is great and it is frothy, so i decided to buy the full sized version.after using it consistently, i noticed that my skin began to flake and dry out, especially around my normally oily areas chin, nose, etc. my skin felt so tight, and then i began to break out all over my face. cheeks, temples, forehead, nose, chin, everywhere. places i never break out, i break out now.never buying this again.",negative
"did not because trouble but did not work for me. nice and light. granted, my under eye area is plagues with dark circles. this was not the solution to my woes.",neutral
"there are two yttp must haves in my bathroom- the kale cleanser and the adaptogen moisturizer. i am adding this amazing exfoliant to this list because wow. first of all, the smell of this product makes me excited to open this bottle every night. its so fresh and crisp. i have been curious about mandelic acid for a while but i do have sensitive skin, so i am very apprehensive about trying certain skincare. this left my skin feeling extremely clean and i feel like next morning my skin looked so hydrated and glowy. i am excited to keep using this product in my nightly routine.",positive
"i ended up having an allergic reaction to this product. if you are going to buy this, do a patch test first. the allergic reaction was terrible. has to miss school and work for a whole week. otherwise salycilic acid is great for acne!",neutral
"honestly would give zero stars. i had gotten a sample a long time ago and really liked how smooth my face felt and even my fingertips from the exfoliant. well i finally ordered a full size bottle and i am not impressed. the hole is so big on top that so much spills out and aloy gets into the lid area. also, i did it always foam so much?? i remember it being paste like, not foaming. i feel like there is zero exfoliation going on, which really sucks because that was the only reason i bought it. waste of money.",negative
"i love this product! i have been using this for about weeks now and my face looks so bright and glowy. i needed a new cleansing face wash since i am almost yrs old and my face needed it. i heard great things about kiehls and i will look into their products from now on, and keeping this one forever!",positive
"i received the mini size as a sample. i love the smell and how soft it leaves my skin after, it has a super fine gritty texture. however, i would not use this as a daily cleanser, either alternate the days or stick to twice a week to avoid over-exfoliating.also, how does anyone get the product out of the bottle? i will literally slam it against my palm or bathroom sink and barely any product will come out. i cannot imagine how much product is just sitting at the bottom potentially being wasted.",neutral
"i have super sensitive skin with dryness as well as redness. i was so looking forward to giving this a go! unfortunately, it is a no for me. it caused a breakout, redness, and bumps. i also felt it did not absorb properly, sort of like sunscreen. it did have a great redeeming factor! it really helped heal my sunburned legs!",negative
"honestly, did not do much for me. it was sticky and smelled weird and my skin just felt slimy afterwards.",negative
"for, i think you can find the same stuff at the drug store. this product is really nice just not worth the price. it has a nice light cocoa butter scent that does not really last on the skin once you are out of the shower. it lathers decently and leaves the skin feeling really nice and clean. i do like this just do not think it is truly worth the price.",neutral
worked well but a little unsure of what the hype is about. was not any better than others i have used. did not notice any dramatic results,neutral
"it is not worth bucks. sometimes my acne flairs up a lot and i end up using- patches a night. this set only comes with dots so it goes by really fast. it would help minimize the acne a little, but it did not really do anything that had lasting affects. you can buy these patches at the drugstore for like bucks and it would do the same thing.",neutral
i wanted to like this moisturizer so badly but unfortunately it dried my oily skin out so much gave me the worst breakouts.,negative
"this is magic in a bottle. literal magic. just get this, you will not need other products i promise. this will replace your ahas, serums, physical exfoliants, toners, masks. just a cleanser, this and moisturizerspf. this stuff just makes your skin so perfect you do not want to use anything else",positive
"unfortunately, i am returning this product before finding out if it is true to its claim. i am sad about it, but i do the asians more-than--step-skincare-regime and i worry about its dimethicone content interfering with my other skincare steps.i have heard good thing about this product and was hopeful when purchasing it. however, once i started using it, i realized how much dimethicone it contains- yes i did read the ingredients list before buying it and i do not know why i still went for it- and i actually feel the dimethicone-ness.i appreciate the reason for this formula is to not use water so the vitamin c can be stored longerin a more stable form and the activation part is the exothermic reaction as vitamin c dissolves upon contact with the moisture on the skin.however, here is my dilemma vitamin c works better when applied as the st product after cleansing the face and per kiehls user instruction, so it means that the dimethicone goes on my face as the st layer as well. but dimethicone is hydrophobic so i worry about it blocking the absorption of my subsequent water-based skincare product application, and dimethicone is not easy to remove without washing my face again so i cannot really wipe away the dimethicone once vitamin c is absorbed and then apply my next serumtoner.so, i am sorry kiehls, i have to return this product.",neutral
perfect for winter!! this stuff makes my skin feel moisturized all day during these cold days.,positive
"absolutely love this. stung pretty good at first, but as your skin gets more accustomed to the potency of the chemical exfoliants, this really makes your skin look so healthy and youthful. i use this- times a week and could not be more happy. minimal aroma. smells vegetal and earthy and totally subtle if anything. for the price too and clean ingredients, its an absolute permanent addition to my skincare collection.",positive
i absolutely love everything about this eye cream. i love the way it applies! i love the way it does help with firming up the lower eye skin! i literally used every last drop of my ml container and will be ordering more! it lasted me a really long time too. i feel like my best guess is the ml lasted me- months and i used it twice a day.,positive
"i received this product compliments of influenster and have used it as directed since receiving it. i do not mind the smell or consistency, but i have not been super impressed with the results, especially considering the price. overall disappointed and would not recommend.",neutral
read all the reviews so decided to go for it. used it consistently and it made my skin breakout even worse.,negative
i would not say this is a gentle cleanser. it left my skin feeling super tight and dry right after washing.,negative
"i am so disappointed in this product. every time i use these eye patches, the serum left behind gunkspills up. the whole point of sheet masks is to leave the serum on your face, but it just balls up under lotion or foundation. these are basically unusable for me. i am so sad.",negative
"this is wonderful rich moisturizer great to use at night. it made of neutral ingredients and has essential oils scent. it is very hydrating and helps to restore my skin overnight. great to pair with midnight recovery concentrate. my skin looks plump, healthier and brighter.",positive
i do not understand the positive reviews... did i get a dud batch? mine was so hard i gave up using it as eye cream it would not spread and used it as a decolletage cream instead of just outright throwing it out.,negative
"so i did a ton of research when i changed my facial routine to vegan. i bought this one as i read amazing reviews. to be honest i love how it does not have a scent to it. it does not apply heavily. it feels like it is doing its thing, but as soon as i apply makeup it goes caky. it is great for evening and weekends when you can get away w a fresh face of no makeup. other than that i was disappointed.",neutral
"really wanted to love this, but unfortunately was not enough to use as an intense moisturizer for my dry winter skin i use an acne cleanser so i needed something really heavy duty. smells very nice though.",neutral
"thank you influenster and ole henriksen for sending me the lemonade smoothing scrub voxbox. i adore many ole henriksen items but this scrub made my skin super duper dry. i usually have combooily skin but this cooler weather has made me dry and peeling like a snake. i thought this product would help peel the dryness of skin but no. i do enjoy the smell. it kind of reminds me of the lemon heads candy. with the scrub, you are able to put it on your clean face and then scrub and wash it off or leave it on for- minutes then scrub and wash it off. i am going to wait and use this in the summer to see if it will make a difference because i will be more oily by that time. i received this product complimentary for testing purposesinfluenster complimentary influenster yourmainsqueeze olehenriksen",neutral

my skin is very dry but sensitive. this is one of my favorite serums. i love how it hydrates my skin without being heavy or sticky. the packing is not the greatest. so i purchased a dark bottle with a dropper for about. now i can enjoy this wonderful serum without fear of squeezing out too much. it is my go to serum everyday.,positive
"while this product does smooth the skin it is also extremely heavily perfumed, i recieved this as a sample and i did definitely notice it smooth out my skin. yet that excitement was overshadowed by the overwhelming perfume trying to choke me. will be throwing out that sample and continuing with my illamasqua instead!!!!",negative
"i got a sample of this in store. i really wanted to like this but i just do not. like one review said, a lot of product gets wasted when it drips between your fingers. it also feels tacky on my face. i see why it would break people out, my face feels greasy and sticky. i thought it would eventually dry out, but nope. so glad i did not buy it!",negative
this stuff does work. i had a acne scarhyperpigmentation above my lip and after two weeks there is a significant difference. however the only con is the heavy lemon scent. it smells like mr.clean,positive
"i am not sure if they have changed the formula, but the bottle i got is not the thick, creamy version i see in pictures. it is very thin and watery. the down-facing squeeze tube is not good packaging for a formula like this i have to hold the bottle upside down, and gingerly tip the bottle down to get the product out which will easily just flow out of the tube. in fact, it will get everywhere if i am not careful. as for the performance of the product, it is ok. it does not break me out, irritate my sensitive skin, and it cleanses well without over stripping. it just does not perform any better or worse than my preferred cheaper drugstore cleanser. perhaps if it was the thick, creamy formula advertised i would have liked it better.",neutral
the product is not worth dollars for it to be so small,negative
"i got this eye gel in the clean slate set in march and loved it. i have hereditary dark circles under my eyes, but a few months ago i noticed they appeared darker and puffier than usual. i have used a wide variety of eye creams in the past and i am used to minor or no results so i did not have any expectations, but this product completely took me by surprise. this product is very hydrating and i love the way it feels when you apply it. there was a very noticeable reduction in my dark circles and the puffiness went down almost completely. i feel like this product turned back time so when i ran out, i immediately purchased the full size. definitely worth a try!",positive
"i was happy to purchase this product because it is marketed towards acne prone and oily skin folks- only to find out that the rd ingredient is coconut oil! coconut oil is known to be comedogenic, especially for folks who already have enlarged pores due to oily skin! it is such a luxurious product, but unfortunately it did break me out a little. my skin is very sensitive so i am assuming it was the coconut oil that irritated it. wish i had different skin so i could use this!!",neutral
"i live in an area heavy with pollution, bad air quality you name it. whether i am wearing make up or not i use this to prep my skin for all the goodness it is about to absorb from my tatcha products. i was previously using it cosmetics makeup remover but when applied my eyeliner and mascara would always get left behind, plus it never left my skin dewy smooth like the camellia cleaning oil did. love love the results.",positive
it really did not do much for me as i thought it would compared to other serums the blackheads did not go away it made it seem more noticeable,negative
"great, hydrating serum. great consistency- not too runny and not sticky. barely has any scent and works best when combined with a moisturizing lotion.",positive
"i honestly hate this toner. it does nothing for my skin, it has a bad texture, it smells bad, it is harsh, it is heavy, it is not moisturizing at all. i absolutely hate it. my skin literally looks bad since i started using it",negative
i love this product and use it everyday. makes my skin smooth and texture free. i use it with the r.n.a cream and the eye cream.,positive
"my skin stayed about the same with this cleanser. it froths well, has no scent, was gentle enough for my sensitive skin, and feels clean. but at the end of the day, ya girl still had plenty of acne to go around the normal amount. bar was smaller than i expected aka a traditional bar size. for the price size, i will try other bars rather than re-purchase this one",neutral
"this advertises as a primer as well as a sunblack, so i thought this would be good for someone with oily skin. however, everytime i have put on, i feel extremely oily by the end of the day versus when i put other sunscreens or no sunscreen on. i bought in the summer and thought it was due to my skin being more oily in the heat but i have recntl tried using it again and found it still makes my skin very oily. i do not recommend this, it you have oily skin.",negative
i love all the products i have from inkey list! this one fell a little flat for me. i will say i love how smooth it goes on and it is not at all greasy which is a huge plus. i did not really see a difference in my eyes and to be honest it almost stungburned a little after application which bothered me. overall not impressed but i still have lots of products from this brand that i want to try!,neutral
"i love this cleanser. it works wonderfully in my oily skin, its very gentle and really makes your sking glow, prevents breakouts and helped with the look of my pores. the only problem is the packaging! somehow every time i order it, it always leaks product so the bottle always losses a little content and the box where it comes ends up stained. the product. wish the product came completely sealed! but this is a home run.",positive
i have tried many products and this one is by far the best for pih caused by acne. works best if you start using it early as the pimple is healing but it also faded some more established marks. it does stink in the tube but once applied to my face i do not notice it and neither does my husband. it does not work in my experience for established sun spotsfreckles but generally otc topicals do not. this product does not break me out and i actually feel it helps with my acne. so overall extremely happy i found this product!,positive
"decent job on dark circles, be careful not to get it above orbital bone as it will be irritating if it gets too close to eyes.",neutral
"i love this product for my dry skin. i hate this packaging! there is sooo much unnecessary plastic, please just put this in a glass jar and call it a day. the writing also falls off the plastic container so you barely want to buy the refill over a new package. please make more sustainable packaging!",neutral
"yeah these are amazing. i have tried the peter thomas roth acne dots and while those are forsure really good too, i have found these are better. i feel like they have more healing ingredients as well as zit zapping ingredients so by the time i take it off, my pimple is pretty much gone. like with no bump or anything. i have been breaking out pretty bad here recently pretty sure it is just due to hormonal acne and these have really really helped. gentle on your skin but not too much where they are not effective!",positive
"i had high hopes for this toner. unfortunately after using it for about weeks, it broke my forehead out. it also created this weird texture on my forehead that went away as soon as i stopped using this. i have very sensitive skin yes but i have not been sensitive to salicylic acid.",negative
"i received this through influenster to test out and honestly, i do not think this product does what it says at all. i have not noticed any brightness or more even skin tone and on top of that, it is made my skin extremely oily everywhere, caused more pimples and tiny bumps. this could be just not a good fit for my skin because i saw many good reviews, but it really just did not work for me. it was also kind of difficult to get the serum out of the bottle as it came in the tiniest drop each time. the packaging is beautiful, but i do not think the actual serum is any good.",negative
"this smells terrible like a wild weed when going on a hike in the mountains. this is marketed for pregnant women, and their sense of smell is so strong. i am not pregnant and i could not stand the smell on my face all day and a pregnant woman would smell it even stronger. could you imagine going on a date, and the guy says what is that stinky weed smell on your face? seriously ladies, run far away from this product. they need to change the name from the inkey list to the stinkey list!",negative
it smells good! but weird consistency...probably not something i would go out of my way to buy.,neutral
"mixed feelings about this. my skin seems to react well, but every time i use it i just think a coconut oil would do the same thing. it just mostly smears around make up and is soooo oily that it leave a slick residue after you rinse it off. i have to use a make up wipe to remove that residue as well as the leftover make up. the bottle says it helps remove make up which i would say is true, it does help, but it does not remove it well. i will not be ordering this again. spending more and getting an actual make up removing balm would be wayyyy more practical of a purchase.",negative
"got this as a sample, was really stocked for it but the smell made me gag. it is atrocious, smells like an old wet dish rag that is been forgotten over weeks! the skin stings during the application, becomes red and just unattractive",negative
"i am undecided about this charlotte tilbury glow toner. i have drier, sensitive skin with some rosacea. i am in my early thirties. some pros are that it feels nice on the skin and does not irritate my rosacea. on the other hand i do not find it very moisturizing or to add any real glow. the packaging also claims that skin will feel baby soft and smooth. i do not find it makes my skin feel particularly softer. i will continue to use it and see if i get better long term results.",neutral
wayyyyyyy too oily...would probably be good if your skin is really dry but it is very very oily and leaves you feeling really greasy,negative
"i never review products but this one i had to comment on. if you have dry skin please skip this. i had to reapply this gel so many times during the day because i would notice my skin becoming extremely dry. after i put on this gel, i notice a glow in my skin and notice that my skin feels moisturized that is why i gave it stars... but that only lasts about min. for the price of this product, i expected way more than this. i will be going back to the original formula which suited me better. this was a complete miss for me.",negative
"this is by far the holy grail of cleansing balms. i have tried everything- from green clean farmacy, take the day off clinique, to the papaya enzyme balm glow recipe. this is the only balm that does not break me out and honestly, my skin actually feels and looks better after using it. takes off waterproof makeup with ease and does not leave that gross oily film on your face. scent kind of reminds me of pool waterchlorine but not enough to bother me. the texture is a bit thicker than most balms and the best way to describe it is like a thick hair gel that melts with the warmth of your hands. i am a sephora employee but bought this with my own money. i will definitely be rebuying this product and i will recommend to people with a similar skin type combo, acne prone although i cannot attest to different skin types. overall amazing product!",positive
plastic clearly in ingredients. should not have a certified clean at sephora logo,negative
"this product does neutralize some redness, but not all. the shade range is very disappointing the lightest shade was still too dark for my fair skin. the product clings to dry patches and you could easily achieve the same result with a good concealer. not worth the money.",negative
"i agree with other reviewers. it is good but not good. the current skincare market is filled with more concentrated hyaluronic acid serums that are also much cheaper. the first ingredients here are water butylene glycol, which are very commonly found in other non-luxury-brand products. it is just not financially reasonable for me to opt for dr. barbara sturm hyaluronic serum when i am essentially paying for water butylene glycol, not ha. there are much more affordable products out that work just as well and contains more ha.",negative
i was excited to try this as i have extremely dry skin and kiehls discontinued my previous go to but this face cream was terrible. it pilled on my skin even if i just put it on by itself with no retinol serum and no matter how long i waited before doing my makeup. i thought it might just be a night cream for me but it was not even that moisturizing.,negative
"i know you have to be careful with retinol, ex. sensitive to sunlight and cannot be applied in the same routine with ahas etc... i put the recommended amount, but i got such a terrible reaction to it. this was maybe my th time applying it over the span of months, and now the skin all around my eyes are puffy, bumpy, and red. maybe the retinol is extra potent in this product. every one is different so just be careful and apply less product than recommended...",negative
gave me acne did not really moisturize. definitely not for me.,negative
"this is not dark skin friendly at all, its white but when you rub it in it turned my skin into a bluepurple hue. you definitely cannot wear this alone",negative
"i have normal skin type and this product made my face dry. i suggest for dry skin types to not buy this product as well. also, why is the consistency of the product is same thing as dish soap? i do not know. it is a nope for me.",negative
"i am glad i purchased the smaller size of this. it has become such a cult favorite amongst influencers that i had high expectations of it. sadly this product did not deliver the results i was hoping for. i love the texture of the product, i felt that when placed on the face, it absorbed quickly into my skin and made it plump and smooth. i did not notice a drastic difference between this and the other moisturizer i use during the day so it did not outweigh my use for my other product. sadly this will be a one time purchase for me. the reason being is that the few times i used this, i broke out. the breakouts were not just one or two small whiteheads, these were deep rooted painful blemishes that lasted a few days. this was the determining factor for me and as much as i wanted to love it, this product did not love me back. try a sample before you commit!",neutral
"i honestly did not notice anything. i do not think they caused any harm but did not notice that they helped make any visible difference, just felt nice and cooling.",neutral
"it just was not the product for me. i wanted to love this face serum, and the whole brightening line but it honestly caused me to break out, and it stung when applied to my face.",neutral
"this product helps you achieve results very quickly, but they are not lasting. i do not have sensitive teeth and have never felt a burning or tingling sensation. i like using this product the week if a big event, but it does not give you long term results.",positive
"i did not feel that my face was clean after using this product. though it is a good price point, naturopathica manuka honey is a better product.",negative
i have only seen a slight change in my undereye dark circles. i do love the consistency of the product. it goes on smooth and absorbs great. i love that this comes in a pump bottle to lessen the contamination risk. i have been using this after i wash my face morning and night. a little seems to go along way. i do hope that with continued use i will see more effectiveness in the dark circles. i will definitely consider repurchasing this once i am out especially if i see changes.,neutral
makes me break out. soft skin yes if you want to deal with new blemishes.,negative
i absolutely love this product.i would recommend this for woman of all ages.,positive
a must have for hot humid days! great to take to the beach and on the airplane to hydrate and refresh.,positive
i am so disappointed! i used the sample i received with a previous order and loved it. i purchased a full size and it is much thicker and pills. i do not understand! i was able to use the sample day and night. i tossed the outer box or i would definitely return it. do not buy!,negative
to be honest... i have not really noticed any initial changes... maybe i just have to keep using it for a longer period of time. but the packaging is super cute! i would totally put this in a will you be my bridesmaid box!,neutral
"wow! this helped speed up the process of fading my acne scars! i tend to get red acne scars around my check area some that have taken. years to completely fade. and i got some new acne scars recently and was bummed because i just cleared my skin. but this product has sped up the process so much! the scars are still there after months, but are sooo much lighter!! with consistent use this product can be a holy grail!",positive
love it! wear it everyday! it not only protects my skin but makes it super glowy,positive
recently started using this eye cream and i am loving it as much as i love any other glow recipe products. the packaging is so cute and pretty. i like the tiny bottle with a pump that is so convenient for traveling too. it is a very lightweight gel like pink eye cream. does not have any strong fragrance and it feels really hydrating as soon as i apply it. it also works really well under makeup and keeps under eye area bright and smooth for makeup application. i love love love this.,positive
"i received this to review. i have been using this for over a month. i have not noticed any significant differences in my skin at all. it is highly fragranced, so be aware if this bothers you. this product did not improve or harm my skin, so i feel it did not do any improvement but it is good that it also did not negatively impact it either. for anti aging products, i would personally look elsewhere.",neutral
i do not know why anyone would want to use this when it contains two different cancer causing pegs and a host of other chemicals that cannot be pronounced. do not use this. just buy a good retinol. this is totally worthless and does nothing except empty your wallet.,negative
this is my all time favorite cleanser. i literally use this everyday and seriously recommend. it smells lovely too.,positive
love the brand and to get this amazing product for such an affordable price is awesome! because you can mix and match it with so many of your products at home and basically customize your own high potency vit c treatment. a must have in my anti aging rutine,positive
"i was very intrigued by this product after reading reviews but honestly this broke me out badly and i did not realize until weeks later. i even cut oit other products to have a simple routine and finally it sawned on me this was irritating my skin. fwiw, i have oily-combo sensitive akin that is also reactive and acne prone so basically it is hard to use most products. but since i have stopped using this, no more cystic bumps. there are too many extracts in this. i also found it greasy on my skin my fav yter gothamista agrees! i am sure if you have normal skin that is not prone to breakout it is fine.",negative
"so, i have used this after looking for a basic exfoliating product and was recommended this. do not get me wrong, it is a great product! but it is the kind of strong stuff that medical aestheticians use when they talk about a chemical peel. i personally feel that even with proper application with gloves, it still is way too strong to be sold to the public. even when i applied it very sparingly with gloves and followed up properly with sunscreen and moisturizer afterwards i can sufficiently say that it damaged my skin barrier. i have given this product over a month or two, yet anytime i try to use it after giving my skin a break i still damage my skin barrier.",neutral
my skin did not react to this product well. it was my first time using hylaraunic acid so i am not sure if it just does not work for me in general or if it is this specific products. it made me breakout severely and i do not have acne prone skin at all. if you want to try this product be careful and test it before.,negative
"amazing!!! i saw an improvement in my skin in a matter of days! i am in love. the texture is great and smells lovely. leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh and glowy!",positive
"have been using this for over a year and i cannot say it is made a huge difference with my eye bags, but this cream does keep your under eye area hydrated and soft. my under eyes can get super dry but this cream really helps take away all dryness!",neutral
love this! my skin feels amazing after i even use it on my upper back and chest,positive
way better than the ordinary one for sure my skin does not feel tacky but moisturized and dewy,positive
i absolutely love this serum. eye serums are incredible and this is one of the best i have tried. i love the texture and it absorbs very easily leaving my skin nice and hydrated. i will definitely continue to use this and highly recommend it to everyone!,positive
i used for about a week and had to stop. my sensitive skin started to really dry out and i probably should have stopped after the first day or so. maybe noticed a little bit of a glow but the dryness probably washed that out more than it benefited.,neutral
this is a super heavy moisturizer and looks and feels very greasy when put on. would recommend it as a night cream with how heavy it is. does not work on the morning before your makeup routine. my makeup was super cakey and greasy after using this before.,negative
was so excited to try this brand after reading about it. the only thing i switched in my skin care regime and i have developed white heads which i never get. very bummed.,negative
i honestly did not like this product at all. i had really high hopes. i essentially wasted on a product that did nothing. it did not help clear my skin. i used it for months..,negative
"received this as a gift and honest review to follow. i was incredibly impressed with this product! first of packaging and the bottle itself is quality, you can tell they truly did not cut any corners and invested into their product. the results were incredible. i noticed a big difference around my eyes and pores on my nose. fine lines were diminished and my pores were much smaller. i also appreciate how incredibly subtle yet clean the cucumber smell is, it is fresh and not over powering. one pump applies smoothly to face and dries well, no sticky or tacky feeling left on skin as it absorbs! this product is now a stable and repurchase for myself!",positive
"i purchased thinking i would end of bringing back because it was not going to work and it did. i am with crows feet and the first time i put this on, i walked away for about minutes and then looked in the mirror and i was stunned. my husband is and has some puffiness under his eyes so i tried it on him and totally gone. i highly recommend this product. i am about to order more since i have coupon.",positive
"this product works much much better than what i expected.it covers redness and is somehow super lightweight! i also love the fact that it has spf. i have used it for about a week now and it has not given me my breakouts or dry skin which is a pleasant surprise.i bought the travel size as i was not sure if i would be satisfied, but am definitely buying the full size once it a empty.",positive
excellent light face cream. leaves my skin feeling hydrated without the bulkiness of a heavy cream. great for daily use! only reason why i did not give it stars because it has not done anything extra spectacular for my skin,positive
"i have been buying the spf version for years. i was a little bummed when i realized they phased it out, so i tried the spf...my skin is oilier than ever before, even after only an hour of application. this is really upsetting, to be honest. the spf version was the only thing that kept me matte for more than hours at a time, and i have no idea if i will be able to find a dupe that comes close. murad, you have made a huge mistake, and i know longtime customers will probably jump ship as a result.",negative
the balm cleanser seems fine enough but it is so thick that the seal at the top of the tube busted open on the first squeeze.,neutral
so far i am not impressed because i cannot get the pump to work. hundred dollars worth of product sitting right in front of me that i cannot use.,negative
i did not like this it made my under eyes darker! caffeine overall is a big no!,negative
"i have been looking for a more affordable replacement for the skinceuticals triple lipid restore so i bought the mini version of this to try it out. the product itself is okay, but for, i was disappointed to find the container over half empty when i opened it. reading through the reviews, this seems like a common issue. for a weeks worth of use is not a good value, so i consider this a miss, and i am grateful i did not spend over to have the same issue.",neutral
"i was really disappointed with how little this did for my skin. it dried out my nose area and did not seem to clean off much of my makeup. i do not think this is for my skin type. if you have dry, bumpy, uneven textured skin this product will not help much.",negative
"works very well. natural result. i have used it for quite some time. unfortunately, my last bottle arrived without a top and the product was spilled all over the box. i am not quite sure how sephora would allow a product to ship without a lid, but that was surprising. i called customer service to let them know and they were not very helpful. stars overall but had to deduct for packaging and customer service.",neutral
"i purchased this product and expected more, but i ended up having a huge breakout of large whiteheads and small blackheads on my chin area. i am livid. after about a month or so of trying to get my face back to normal, most of my active pimples finally dried out, but now i have more hyperpigmentation than before i used this. a horrible product.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from laneige. i absolutely love this face mist. it is perfect for my combination skin. i like the fine mist nozzle and the way it lightly mist my face. it does not come out to heavy and sinks right into my skin. it gives my skin hours of hydration with white leaf tea, which helps my skin feel soothing and calming. you can use the mist with or without makeup, to give your face a beautiful dewy glow. it is also convenient to travel with and take on the go. its perfect for this hot weather to freshen up my face when needed and give it a hydrating boost. i honestly love this face mist and all of the laneige products. their products are incredible and i am always excited to try more.",positive
i have used this product times a day for days now and i do have pretty dry skin. it does feel refreshing. its good for a quick skin pick me up. but it has not been long enough to see a big difference. i do have sensitive skin and so far no reactions so that is a plus... also it does not have any harsh fragrance to it which is a plus for me,neutral
"after all the amazing reviews i was super excited to try this. there is definitely a learning curve as to how to properly use this product. messy at first. i had to figure out how to put a dab of water into my palm after putting a touch of this powder- then mix- then apply. i am adept at many things, but this is difficult because too much water and it dissolves. too little and it gets cakey and clumps.then, on my face if i do not use enough water it is like a sand white as in way too white powder mask. and i am like-woah, not going for the clown face today. i have applied sunscreen over this and it is not noticeable however then i feel like i have a bunch of junk on my face. i will use this occassionally mostly as a setting powder if i feel oily that day. lots of people love this. i do not see myself buying or recommending it due to the above mentioned factors.",neutral
"this is the best feeling foam cleanser i have ever used by far. i love how simple it is, and i definitely feel like my skin texture has improved since using this. once i run out, i probably will not repurchase since this was part of a major treat yo self birthday moment, but i will always respect and recommend her to anyone willing to drop some dough!",positive
i prefer oils for my skin instead of creams. i love the way this oil absorbs into the skin and not sit on it. light enough to penetrate but definitely provides the hydration my skin needs. i appreciate it greatly after a day in the sun and humidity. wears well under makeup and ince it is on my skin it does not look oily. great for taking care of dry patches too.,positive
"i use this cleanser as a second step when double cleansing after wearing makeup, or just to wash my face with in the morning when i wake up. it is a nice gentle gel cleanser with great ingredients, i will give it that. but it did not make any difference when it came to my pores, breakouts, or blemishes. it is not bad by any means, but i just do not find that it made any changes to my skin to justify the price tag. overall, it is a decent cleanser, but simply not worth the price tag if you are looking to make a true difference in the overall appearance of your skin.",neutral
i have added this to my skincare routine along with origins toner and moisturizer. my acne has gotten so much better it is unbelievable. i have been struggling with acne for about- years which also means i have tried literally every medication and cream. nothing worked but this. i am so glad i was introduced to this by a close friend of mine. my skin feels baby smooth and i can also see my scars now starting to diminish,positive
"i exfoliated my face the day before and moisturized to make sure i was working with a fresh canvas. i applied with f.a.bs barriair moisturizer. i made sure to mix the tanning oil into the moisturizer thoroughly prior to application of the product. i ensured the application was both even and well pressed into the skin as was recommended by other reviewers. my skin did not equally picked up the tan. around my lips is considerably darker shades darker than anywhere else on my face. looks silly. also, the color is not true to my actual tan color, so it did not match my tan body. furthermore, this product includes coconut oil which is highly occlusive and should be avoided for anyone prone to breaking out. i now have a strange ring around my mouth, new zits blackheads, and a cyst. will not buy this product again.",negative
"so i wanted to love this product because i love necessaires other products but this one was just okay. first, i do appreciate this is mineral and silicone free. i also love there is no scent. but it left that white cast on my face and felt a bit tacky on my skin. so this sunscreen was just okay for me.",neutral
"i tried this out and absolutely loved it at first. it tingles nicely, makes my skin feel nice and clean, and smells so lovely. but i had the worst breakout of my life- worse than even my puberty breakouts- and eventually realized this was what caused it. i stopped using it and my skin slowly got better. then i started using it again and my skin broke out once again. i do not change much within my skincare routine, so this had to have been the culprit. i am so upset because i really loved it initially, but it just does horrors for my skin. would not recommend for even slightly sensitive skin",negative
i bought this product to help with chronic facial redness. unfortunately i think my face is even redder than before! however my face has never felt this soft before in my life. my skin feels so smooth and hydrated that i have not needed primer all week- my foundation just glides on- i am truly astonished at how much i love this product. the scent is a little strong but i have been putting it on right before bed and it does not bother me in the least.,neutral
"not sure what went wrong with this formulation. it smells and feels great... but after two days of use, i am breaking out. super bummed but not surprised. moon juice is not a skincare brand- it is packaged adaptogens that have been used in ayurveda for lifetimes with the addition of artificial sweetener. you are paying for branding, not science. skincare is a little more complex. i am sure they paid a ton of money for this formulation, but i am not impressed. return.",negative
my favorite night cream. is super hydrating but does not make me feel like my face is still wet when i go to bed,positive
"got this as a sample and this worked wonders! was super hydrating and was not finicky to put on and stays put. there was not a strong scent, and my sensitive skin did not have a reaction. will be purchasing the full pack!",positive
"i really wanted to love this cream, but shortly after using this i noticed i was getting these red bumps on my face, which i am sure was caused by the fragrance in the cream. it does moisturize my face very well but wish it did not because me to break out and have such a strong fragrance",neutral
i am giving this skin product stars. looking at the ingredients it can surely be a great product for many skin types. one first use it felt well and left my skin with a nice shine. upon the the second use i woke up the next morning with irritated skin and itchy. i believe it can help others but also remember to wear sunscreen after using this product. as much as i would have loved to use this full product unfortunately i was not able to and will be gifting to someone with much less sensitive skin.,neutral
"i have combination skin, and used this product for over two months. did not really see any difference, and only made my skin drier during peak winter and did not work well with my foundation. i do not really think it helped correct my skin in any way either.",neutral
"i honestly cannot yet comment on the effectiveness of the product having just used it for one day, but i will say the fragrance in this serum is really off putting. i dislike it so much i do not know if i can continue use. it is a strong floral scent, so heads up for those who do not love strong fragrance in their skincare.",neutral
"i loved the thick consistency and how it goes on smooth. it does not really have a scent, it kind of just smells neutral. i do feel like this is a great moisturizer for my dry skin. no clogging or breaking out from it. i have not really noticed any changes in wrinkles, but i have not really had this long enough to.",neutral
this is a basic moisturizer touted as a life-changing skin product. the smell and texture are both nice but it is not anything special. it is way overpriced for what it does.,neutral
"the packaging looks similar to the watermelon line from glow recipe. the sunscreen feels lightweight and it does not leave a white cast even though this one is a hybrid sunscreen. however, i experienced pilling while i am trying to blend it on my skin and that to me feels like a waste of product. i never experienced any skin irritation so i am kind of disappointed because this could be a great sunscreen.",neutral
"it is a fine moisturizer. for the price, i expected my skin to look or feel healthier after using and finishing this product. my skin looks and feels the same as using a drugstore moisturizer. this gave my skin no improvements. that being said, it did not because any irritation or breakouts either. overall, just a very meh moisturizer for me. the reason i would discourage anyone from buying this is because it runs out incredibly quickly. the packaging is x the size of the product in there, and you will have no way of knowing how much your using due to the packaging. i had to use a lot of this to moisturize my face and was shocked how fast i ran out. for i expected this to last me more than a month or make my skin feel extra happy hydrated. overhyped product.",negative
this just made me greasy and have a cystic breakout.,negative
"honestly i do not really notice much difference in my skin. it feels really nice and makes my serums and lotion go on nice and smoothly, but i do not think i would pay this much for it. liquid is clear and does not smell unpleasant.",neutral
expensive but wonderful. i typically stay away from manual exfoliation products but got this as a sample from goop and subsequently bought it. effective product and will continue to buy and use.,positive
"after using this product for the past two weeks, my skin became very dry, felt like paper and i got a breakout! not the one!",negative
packaging and the advertisement is great. i am all eyes and ears when it comes to watermelon anything... product is great but the smell.... that is a no no for me,negative
"i am an avid fan of bha skincare, i have sebumkeratin plug issues and cyst acne. picked this up since the toner i regularly used was out of stock all around me. after two weeks this was not working for me. i started to get clogged pores in parts of my face where i have not broken out and textured skin on my forehead. this was way more than just a purge. not that it was reacting from the toner horribly, but rather the toner was not doing the job like my previous one did.",negative
this product is great for someone with dry skin! love the feel and packaging of the product. squalane has become an important ingredient for me when looking for a moisturizer. might not work for someone with oily skin.,positive
"this is not for combination skin. it literally sucks the oil out of your skin, so the areas of your face that you consider normal or even a bit dry will look and feel like a desert landscape. this surprised me, because i have rarely seen my cheeks and area around my lips that dry and flaky. and this was only after three days of using this product. there was no change in whether, no air-conditioning or heater blowing at my face, no exposure to sunshine even. just this product. the reason it still gets two stars from me is that my forehead, which is my very oily area, was fine, so i plan to use this in this area alone on some days. i also like the texture. however, if you are looking for a moisturizer that you can use on your entire face and let us be honest, that is fair, i would only buy this if you are experiencing oily skin overall.",negative
"i am not sure why people gave this bad reviews- cream based cleansers are really effective for dry or combo skin. i have combo, acne-prone, sensitive skin live in a dry environment. this cleanser is perfect for me. when i wear make up, i use farmacy cleansing balm first, then go in with this. i would not recommend this product for oily skin types- use a gel cleanser.",positive
i have been using this for a little over a week. i absolutely love the packaging but think it could smell a bit better. it is a thick cream but does not feel too heavy on the face. it has my skin feeling super hydrated and really smooth. i would definitely purchase this in the future.,positive
"the moisturizer is good, although perhaps it is too fragrant but the main problem is the pump mechanism that the refill comes in stops functioning after about two months. i bought this because i wanted to get something eco friendly and less wasteful plus i am pregnant. the aggravation it caused makes it almost not worth it. will not purchase again.",negative
"my skin is far from perfect, and the masks make it so much worse. i found a sample of this in my drawer and decided to give it a shot. wow, this stuff is good! the redness was almost gone, and the actual blemishes were so much smaller and less noticeable. now i am getting the full size product.",positive
"i wish is could give this. stars. i stumbled across this while searching for a cheaper alternative to the clinique moisture surge. i love using this in the morning before makeup. it does give that glass skin affect many people are after and it is more affordable than many options. however, i find myself wanting something richer in the evenings.",positive
i have a sensitive skin and it irritated my skin really bad. when i started using it i noticed that my entire face was breaking out and when i stopped using it the break out went away. i do not recommend this product for dry sensitive skin!,negative
"i have dry to normal skin and using this product did not help with my driness, as my skin would start flaking after i take my showers. but if your looking for just a standard cleanser that does not do much, except for help cleanse this would be for you!",negative
"i have not had enough time to really see the effects of this product, but on the surface, it goes on sticky and has a super strong off putting scent. because of those two factors, i am worried about breaking out. with so many other products on the market that advertise the same results, this is not one that i would consider purchasing.",neutral
"the brightening effects are fantastic!!! however, the derma-e vitamin c serum gave me the same results for less than a fourth of the price so there are other options out there fyi. but great to try because my skin type is not the only on out there. have a good dayor night!",neutral
i loved how the dr.dennis gross extra stength peel worked. left my skin so smooth.,negative
"i am going to go to my grave with a bottle of this in my clutches! so it is, i am going along thinking i have a handle on life, there is a work life balance, i am going to the gym and eating healthy... and cue the start of the global pandemic. not only did all of that go to hades in a hand basket but my skin did a complete i am blaming stress and i mean it is bad, i have always had smooth skin and i woke up one morning to uneven, dull, patchy skin. no matter what i did or tried it just did not get any better, that is, until my bff suggested i give this bay boy a try. i saw results before the end of the week, i had my skin back by the end of the month and honestly it felt and glowed better than before.is it a miracle product? well, kind of. i have always had sensitive skin i mean i developed an allergy to highly popular dermatologist created brand but the cbd and other magics has really made a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. so when people ask me what i do to keep my skin healthy and glowing i usually point them in this direction.",positive
i first noticed the strong scent with this product. it smells live dove bar soap. i do not really mind it. i was just very surprised to smell that. it is foamy and lathers nicely. it leaves my skin feeling clean.,positive
"i love the texture of this essence and i really wanted to love this since i love tatcha but this essence did not work for my skin at all. i am currently using this, the vitamin c serum and the water cream and both this and the water cream irritates my nose which is the most sensitive part of my face so much!! i am still going to continue using the water cream with the vitamin c serum i looove the serum but i will just give the essence to my mom because her skin is absorbing this really well i will give this stars because of that. everyone has different skin though so this might work for you.",neutral
"i am not even sure how i stumbled upon this product. but omg it really glides on and then sinks into the skin, giving it a very dewy look and texture. i have even added it in the evening in between meetings, which just freshens up the skin. absolutely love!",positive
"does not dry out or irritate my very sensitive skin, also really helps to bring redness out of my skin! i have a very red nose and cheeks and this cleanser has really calmed that down in only a few days! absolutely love it",positive
i will start off by saying i love how lightweight that it feels on my face and it does make my skin feel nice and soft however it feels more like a serum than a moisturizer. i like the price point and that it also contains fairly good ingredients but i do not think this is for me.,neutral
"this is the most amazing moisturizer. i got a free sample as a birthday gift from sephora and i love it. yes, it is expensive, but you can feel the difference in your skin when you apply it. it plumps up dry skin.",positive
"the product appears to be good does not peel white like other sunscreens, but do not think i will be buying again. the packaging is cute which is what made me choose it over other brands, but man does it suck i do not even want to reach for it anymore every time i hold it my hands end up so flaky from the bottles coating i have to hold the bottle w a baby wipe now so it does not end up all over my face.",neutral
if i could give this cream stars i would. i swear it created wrinkles under my eyes that were not there before. i thought it was just me but after looking through the reviews others have had the same experience. really regret using this cream and worried my under eye skin may have been affected long term. so disappointed.,negative
"it is an ok cleanser, would not buy it again. you can find better for cheaper",neutral
"gets the job done, but does make my face feel tingly when putting on. it is a good price, but i do not like how the packaging is empty air.",neutral
this product is a great feature to their line! i love being able to use it at night to help soften my dark spots. the texture is gel like and not greasy on the face. the scent is very neutral.gifted by peace out skin care,positive
i have extremely dry skin even feel dry during hot summer. recently i start to feel like my previous lightweight sunscreen is too dry and too lightweight on me. but i still do not want those sunscreen that makes me feel like there is an oil mask on my face. so i tried this. it is hydrating while not give me that oil mask. also the protection is great for daily use. definitely recommended!,positive
what is the hype?? all this mask did was break me out in some spots on my face. the only positive is that the product actually sinks into your skin and there is no texture left after application. very disappointed otherwise.,negative
leaves my skin feeling soft. i have super sensitive skin and am very wary of trying new products just incase of a flare up reaction. i tried a small test amount and no reaction so good to go. it does not foam up as much as your typical cleansing wash but does not dry out my skin. i use a cleansing brush so a dab on the brush works just fine. i also recommend this is you want a non fragranced cleanser since i am also super sensitive to smellsfragrances,positive
"i have no idea why this product gets to much hype. i searched for this for a long time everywhere was sold out. i was very let down. it is not terrible but it is not amazing either. i really do not find it any better then a lot of other out there. it only lasts a few days, it does have the slight smell. i also find it a tad bit on the orange side. i have med skin tone. i have a ton of pigmentation, this seems to not trigger this as some does. it does dry my faces out. i have dry skin though. i have it a star since it is okay. do not get too excited as i did.",neutral
"i have been using herbivores lapis oil and decided to try this out because of the reviews and the fact that i actually have combination skin. strictly comparing it to the lapis oil i would say this the scent is too strong and smells synthetic. i think it is perfumey in a way that i do not want my facial products to be. for my combination skin, i think the lapis for oily skin actually hydrated my skin more effectively. i use caudalie essence, their serum and then top with herbivore facial oil. and i do not wear foundation and like my skin to feel and look dewey. i was def getting all that with my previous routine and will be switching back.",neutral
"smells so bad!after applying the serum, my face felt like bark. do not buy this product because it is on sale!",negative
this is such a wonderful night cream i have recently had the chance to try! i have always been a fan of origins skincare products so i was excited to try this out! for the past two weeks every other night i have been applying this product into my nighttime skincare routine! not only does my skin start show a nice soft glow toy once dull skin it has improved the small lines around the corners of my eyes! this is an impressive cream that definitely delivers results i like and want in a product! it is lightweight and has a nice feeling! does not leave my skin feeling sticky it soaks right into my skin good! i am excited to tell my friends about this wonderful product! if your feeling like your skin needs some pep to it is step is definitely recommend this product to you!,positive
"i purchased this product after reading all the raving reviews and was so optimistic that this would solve my challenges with dull, aging skin. i have combination, acne prone skin and i use differin every night. i used this product during the daytime after toner, before moisturizer. maybe my expectations were just too high but after weeks of use, i noticed literally no difference in my skin. it did not hurt, but also did not help. for the price, if you really want results, go to your derm and get a chemical peel. now that works!!!!!",negative
"i really wanted to like this night oil, however, i could not get past the horrid smell. every time i went to use this i felt like i was seasoning my face with spices. way too savory a smell. overall the product worked well enough. i wish i could bring my self to use it more often to gauge it is effectiveness. i experienced a softer more supple face when using this oil....until the wolves caught my scent and devoured my face.",neutral
i did not like the way my skin felt after i used this cleanser. it leave a rubbery feeling. i also have not seen much difference from my regular cleanser.,neutral
i purchased this expecting great things but honestly the cream seems to just stay on the surface and never absorbs! in the morning it feels just like its sitting on top of the skin and it is been on overnight! i will not repurchase,neutral
"i really love this mask probably the best chemical peel mask i have ever used. this gel mask goes on clear and dries creating this firm glossy clear look. it is gently enough for even sensitive skins. i used to used blue tansy chemical peel mask, but found that it was too stripping of my natural oils. just like any other mask or cleanser you must use more than once to notice results. the first time using this product my face was very smooth and moisturized. after using for about three weeks i have noticed clearer skin with a slight dewy glow. i like a lot of tata harpers products, because of the natural ingredients.",positive
"not worth the hype for the price. it is a decent oil however outside of increased moisture, i saw little to no difference in radiance, smoothness, texture or complexion.",neutral
"this was not the product that i want to buy originally when i went to the store the beauty advisor told me it will do the same as the other product that i wanted. i have been using this product for about weeks now, i am have not seeing any major change with the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. maybe it take some time so i will continue using it until i see some kind of change. on the side, there are a few things that i do love about this product i do have to admit it very light serum easy to apply on the skin. it does not give me any irritation and you do not feel when you put on sticky everywhere.",neutral
"i love this product! it smells amazing, and feels so refreshing!!! and i feel like it gives my skin a really deep clean.",positive
not a fan. i have oily skin and this just made things worse. i cannot use it during the day. i felt so greasy by the time i got off work. i will say that it felt great but i would not recommend to anyone with oily skin.,negative
"i bought it so it could help with my dark circles did not notice too much of a difference, but did leave my under eyes moisturized. that is why i rated it a plus it is a lil pricey.",neutral
i do not know why this gets such amazing reviews- did nothing special for my skin and actually got some bumps on my forehead,negative
"i expected this product to be super hydrating and it was not. i have used their other moisture surge products but this one missed the mark. it does leave your skin feeling smooth, but not hydrated.",neutral
got my sephora package today and used this cleansing balm to remove my makeup and oh my..... made my face feeling clean and fresh. i did not have to massage my face too long to remove my makeup.,positive
i only received the days of age fighting power samples but let me tell you...using this in combination with the goodnight glow retin-alt sleeping creme my skin has never looked so good!! i never would leave the house without foundation now i feel like my skin looks great and am comfortable leaving the house without any make up! love this product and will be buying the full size of both!,positive
"wayyy too overly fragranced in my opinion. i also have extremely dry skin, and this dried my skin out terribly probably due to the fragrance. for oz, this is horrendously overpriced for what you are getting. cute packaging high price does not equal high quality skincare!!!",negative
highly recommend it is amazing and you actually see a difference especially on the forehead,positive
i was able to try this for free to provide my opinion. as someone with rosacea this was way too harsh on my skin. it made my skin more red so i had to stop using.,neutral
i love this! i have very oily skin and i use this at night for added moisture. it goes on so smoothly and gave my skin no issues! sadly i have tried the ordinary and my sensitive skin just did not react well to it. my skin loves paulas choice and this is another great product from the brand!,positive
"love its oily feeling for dry skin during winter, but it smells exactly the same as ham.",neutral
"i am new to double cleansing. but this precleansing oil felt pretty thick and greasy and the scent was like a strong lysol lemon scent. it did not remove all my mascara and i had to follow up with a cleaner to get all the greasy precleansing oil out of my skin. also, after using toner there was still always makeup on the pad. it is not for me and might have ruined the continuation of precleansing in my routine.",negative
i have been using this product for almost two months and although it does leave my under eye and eyelids feeling much softer it does nothing for the fine lines under my eyes... if anything they have gotten worse throughout my use of the product. i had high hopes due to the reviews and i love the actual application of the product but it did not do anything for me.,neutral
"i tolerate fragrance, but this is too much for me it is the only thing that i smell during the day and it can be really overwhelming. i tried to use it at night, but still i just smell the product. i use it before my workout knowing that it will last less during the day, so i can proceed to shower after. it hydrates my skin, but it is a pricey product that did not work for me. if they change the bottle to use most of the product and they have a free fragrance option i am open to try it again, but this one is a big no. i will not re-purchase",neutral
"yes yes yes! favorite sunscreen of all time! just beautiful and the glow! i am obsessed! on its own or under makeup, i just love it!",positive
i did not like the feeling of this primer. it also pills. took it back.,negative
love this serum stick! so moisturizing and leaves my skin super dewy which is rare in the winter!,positive
i have pimples sometimes which can be very red so i bought this as a color corrector. it does reduce redness a little bit but gives you a kind of ashy look and is difficult to blend out if you have brown skin. i am actually only a mediumtan color but it is still visible. love dr jart masks but still looking for a good color corrector for brown skin.,neutral
i did not like the way this felt on my skin. it was a little sticky and when it oxidized my complexion looked orange. i do not like the scent either for this product. i did not feel the sunscreen aspect of this was strong enough for the florida sun. my skin still got red a little after sun exposure.,negative
i would have liked this product me if it was a serum than a cleanser. it makes it not much different from other aha cleansers,neutral
"wanted to love this but i am disappointed. does not provide much colour unless you use a significant amount of drops. after using just once, i could see the bottle will not last long if i want to get a decent amount of colour. at this price range, i do not think it is a good value because you have to use quite a bit for each application. also, cannot seem to get rid of the orange colour on my hands even though i wash them thoroughly after application. i will be returning unfortunately.",negative
"this is not the worst cleansing balm i have used, but it was far from the best. pros it breaks down sunscreen- both chemical and mineral- pretty well and leaves my skin wonderfully soft. it does not contain any fragrance, dyes or irritating ingredients, so it is fantastic for sensitive, reactive skin.cons the product did not have a consistent texture. it was not great at removing makeup. i tried it on both a full face and just waterproof mascara days, and was left unsatisfied every time i had to go back in with micellar water after double cleansing. in sum, i expected a much better performance from this balm based on the rave reviews and the hefty pricetag, but was left disheartened. it leaves ones skin soft but is far better at removing sunscreen than makeup. not worth.",neutral
"not to much of a fan. it left my skin feeling super oil and greasy, when i looked to see my face was like a oil slick. i do not even like it as a over night cream. guess it would be okay for after a treatment or on super dry skin but i can not use it. gifted by skinfix.",negative
"i received this product from influenster for my honest review. i was very excited to test this product, however, upon using it i was not so excited. the moisturizer left my under eyes, neck and upper lips burnt, puffy and extremely dry afterwards. i was shocked because i do not have sensitive skin and used to using actives in my routine. it did give my skin, that was not burned or puffy, a glow and felt hydrated. which is why i gave it a star. i personally will not be using this product moving forward. i only recommend this product to people who are not using any actives in their routine and can tolerate actives. i also would not recommend using it everyday and if so, only with a sunscreen after. this for me is a use at your own risk product.",neutral
"i love this oil so much that it actually annoys me a little bit, because it is on the more expensive side. i have used this combined with a moisturizer and by itself, and i prefer using this with a moisturizer. i just use a cheap but trusty drugstore moisturizer for the combo so the oil can shine. i have used this in both am and pm depending on what i thought my skin needed- i just use a bit less in the am and it absorbs super quickly.i own skin products at this point and use almost all of them on a rotating basis. the first day i used this in the am, i had what i call a good skin day. even my husband commented, which is rare. but because my face is basically just a revolving door of potions and serums and creams at this point, i did not connect it to this oil at first.as time went on though, i noticed that more and more of my good skin days occurred when i used this product. it is so good at taking dull winter skin and giving it some glow. i also feel that it gives me a more even skin tone overall. long story short, there is rarely a day that i do not reach for it in either am or pm. given the number of bottles and tubs collecting dust in my skincare drawer, that is really saying something. looking forward to continuing to test this product in summertime!",positive
"this is make up, not skin care. it is packed full of glitter that makes anyone especially with dark skin look like an orange disco ball. it also stings my skin during application. this hype is unfounded.",negative
"i had been wanting to try this product for a long time but was put off by the price. i finally went for it, and was really surprised about heavily fragranced it is. i thought it was for sensitive skin? i admit i did not even put it on my face as i could already imagine how much my face would sting and turn red. i was surprised and disappointed.",negative
"i was very hesitant to use acid on my face scary word! but finally broke down because i really wanted to target the texture of my face. i started with mandelic after reading it was the gentlest option of the common ahas. i use rx retinoid, so i use the mandelic every other night and rotate the two products. after two uses i swear it unclogged a pore on the side of my nose that had been there for years. i did not have any side effects like redness or peeling, i also apply hyaluronic acid and a face lotion after this product. i have felt like my skin looks smoother since i began using. you also cannot beat the price. i hope to graduate to lactic and glycolic acid in the future",positive
"i absolutely love the camo drops from this same line, so i decided to try this product to get the added benefit of an spf. however, i highly prefer and recommend the camo drops over this. this product is much harder to spread around the face and absorb into the skin, and the shade of beige it turns into is too dark for my fair skin tone. it also leaves a film on my face- like a cream foundation would. if you have redness in your complexion, i suggest using the camo drops.",negative
love this face oil! super hydrating i have very dry skin.not greasy! lightly scented. also great when using my gua sha tool.,positive
"this cleanser leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and moisturized. i do not feel like i am drying my skin out, even when using it twice a day. would definitely purchase again!",positive
i bought the full size of this product. i tend to purchase the clean at sephora products and i love probiotic containing products. i have fairly dry dull skin and although this did not make it worse it did not hydrate it how i would expect a product such as this too. i found i had to use quite a bit when i did use it and therefore i went through the product very quickly. i will not be repurchasing.,negative
"i got this free from la mer for review purposes. i had to try this out when i got the chance! it is extremely moisturizing. i would say it is best for pretty dry skin. i think it will be best for me in the winter when my skin is drier. i really do not like the fragrance of this stuff. it is not necessarily a strong scent, but it is not pleasant.",neutral
the smell is very strong. too strong to the point where i hate wearing this. i also find it dries quite tacky and does not feel great on the skin. it did provide moisture but i would never repurchase.,neutral
"when i get a break out or flare up on my skin, this is my go-to solution. i just dab a bit of it on my acne twice a day after washing my face and putting on my skin care once in the morning and once in the evening and within a day or two, the acne is gone. i have tried so many different spot treatments and this one is the one i always have stocked in my skincare bag. it is expensive for the bottle size it is tiny but worth the money. i think the last bottle i had for a year before i finally finished it!",positive
"i received this farmacy daily greens moisturizer complimentary from farmacy beauty in exchange for my honest review. there are a lot of things that i like about this moisturizer! i love that there are no parabens or artificial fragrance. i also really love the fruit, vegetable, and other plant extracts. with this being a clean beauty product, i do not feel guilty using it. however, this moisturizer states that it is oil-free and is meant for combination and oily skin like mine... yet when i applied this product, at first it felt really nice on my skin, but after it dries it has a very heavy after feel and leaves my skin feeling tacky and like it is unable to breath. it does not fully absorb into the skin, which is very frustrating because i was really wanting to love this moisturizer since it has such amazing benefits. i think using this moisturizer under foundation might not be so much of an issues since your skin cannot breath under makeup anyway.",neutral
"i have not noticed too much of a difference in the past week i have been using this, but it does not irritate my skin so i will definitely keep it in my routine until i see results! it is lightweight and soaks into the skin fast. more to come after after a month of using it!",neutral
"the product actually works well. at the suggestion of a sephora staff member, i dropped major bucks and purchased this alongside the lord jones cbd oil. i love all things sunday riley, but i cannot get over the awful smell. i know my nose is sensitive to smells, but this smell did not go away. instead it is on my pillow case and my pajama top. it is honestly horrendous. i have been powering through because i paid almost for both products and cannot seem to make myself throw it away, but i would much rather use the luna oil. it is smells like someone is tart breath when they have gone a whole day without eating or drinking anything. disgusting.",neutral
"a year or so ago, i left this toner for a paulas choice toner among a few others that i thought was working well for me but eventually gave me tons of texture on my forehead. thinking of what toner to try our next, a sephora employee recommended this biossance toner and i relented nothing but good things about it. started using this one again and my skin instantly cleared back up. i will remin faithful to this toner yet again. i have combooily skin",positive
i was very skeptical of this at first and only bought it because i had a gift card would not normally spend on a tiny bottle lol. it has a weird smell and i do not love the way it feels on my skin at first but i do love the way it looks. i only use it when i am leaving the house need to conserve and after applying it i feel like i do not even really need to put on makeup. it really is glowy. it is also good for using under your makeup routine. i have acne prone combination skin and i am still trying to figure out if it makes me breakout. i will miss it when it is gone but it is definitely overpriced. would give. stars.,neutral
this is by far the best cleansing balm i have ever used! i have extremely sensitive and reactive skin and this is the first cleansing balm that has not irritated my skin or eyes. the ingredients are really simple and there is no fragrance which is an a in my book.,positive
felt smooth and my makeup looked good on top. got it as a sample and i ordered the full size,positive
"even with buying this at half price it was totally not worth it. i am almost done with the bottle and there is no effect on my skin with this product, no long term and no short term results. it is has a real slippery, silicone like feel to it, does not absorb, does not plump, does not moisturize. terribly disappointing to see such an overpriced product fail like a drugstore brand.",negative
works well. definitely deep cleans pores but left my skin a little dry.,neutral
i love this eye cream! i received this product from influenster and am so happy! the eye cream is soooo luxe and moisturizing. worthit,positive
made me break out so bad!!! huge large red painful breakouts in places on my face that i do not even normally break out in. terrible. took weeks for my face to fully recover after i realized it was this product.,negative
this serum honestly works wonders. after having my daughter my skin turned so textured and i had slight break outs here and there due to hormonal changes but this saved me! my skin is much more smooth and all the redness has been significantly reduced on my forehead and cheeks! it also makes my skin looked plump and very youthful despite the lack of sleep! i have only been using it for three days and i have already recommended it to my family and friends because it is the new holy grail in my routine.,positive
"very disappointed. i have dry, and sensitive skin. so i cannot just lather on a think layer. i really wanted to like this, but i break out every time i use it and it never seems to fully absorb. way way to rich for a day cream-- i would be so gross by the end of the day, that i could not wait to get home and wash my face. i tried this for two weeks-- a little goes a long way-- and i am ready to return it.",negative
love the product but the smell is overpowering and hard to get over.,neutral
"i initially thought that this would be the perfect product for my in-between-skin. currently dry acne prone due to the changing weather here in nyc. the formula is light and creamy as advertised, however i find that even with just the smallest amount you really only need half a pea sized to get it foamed up properly it leaves my face feeling tight and uncomfortable after the wash. it makes me feel like i have striped my skin too much, which is why i am not a fan. for the price, i think that this is a good amount of product, seeing as how you really do not need much product per use. my skin is not overly dry, but if you do have dry skin i am not certain this is the cleanser for you. i love fab, but this product sadly did not live up to its gentle claims.",neutral
"so did you know collagen molecules are too large to be absorbed through the skin? is a waste for this product i am so grateful i did not pay for this i received a deluxe sized sample in my sephora play box this is straight up garbage.i guess technically i did pay for this sample so of course i used it, yeah like i figured it did nothing but leave my face looking like year old boys, there was more grease on my face then the pizza my children ate for dinner last night.if that statement alone does not cut it for you and your still considering buying this abomination. it is extremely sticky and does not sink into the skin, not to mention the applicator is terrible and if you want to fight everyday for your snake oil then by all means.but if all that was not enough the scent of the item is reminiscent of the s mixed with sadness and old people and gives you enough pimples to make you feel like your again.the only person i would recommend this to is anyone with to burn and need a crappy moisturizer even then i would recommend they light it on fire then waste money on this product.",negative
"needed a new face wash. i have sensitive skin and this definitely exceeded my expectation. my skin is smoother, even and my breakouts are minimal. definitely will continue purchasing.",positive
"positive i appreciate that this does not have an overly chemically smell and the lotion spreads nice with no clumping or patchy spots. it does what it is supposed to, it is a sunscreen.negative i have sensitive normal skin. i used this on my face and i broke out. i am years old and never have had a break out before. i feel like it sinks into your pores compared to sitting on the skin. and although i received this free for my honest opinion, looking at the price tag i would not spend that. does it work... yeah, is it anything special... not really.",neutral
the face wash has a very strong chemical smell. leaves my face feeling kind of greasy.,neutral
"ok pros and cons pros- my face seemed very clean and not too dried out after wiping clean.cons- pads are very small and thin, needed to use could have used to get everything off.",neutral
it was okay. i tried this after using confidence in an eye cream which is a better choice for dark skin to camouflage dark circles. ok for moisturizing.,neutral
just in once use my under eyes feels super hydrated for make-up without or without an extra primer. i have lines under my eyes and some on the sides and this eye cream helps smooth the texture and give a little glow,positive
unfortunately i did not really enjoy this product. i am relatively new to retinol and have sensitive skin so i was excited to try this product out. it is marketed as a gentle retinol and comes as an oil. i mixed about drops into my moisturizer to reduce irritation but still experienced a bit of irritation when i first started using the product. after about a week i did not get any irritation anymore but even after using for about weeks i have not seen any brightening effects. the oil has a natural scent that i do not really like unfortunately. i may have to ramp up my usage to- times a week but i have seen brightening effects with other brands retinol using them- times a week.,neutral
"i really like this moisturizer! it is quite thick and moisturizing, but does not feel heavy or greasy! i have semi-dewy skin normally, so somehow this moisturizer balanced it and worked really nicely with the charlotte tilbury aff. i like using this more at night, since it is a bit more moisturizing than my day time one and because it is does not contain spf. the scent is semi-herbal and not overpowering. so far, i really like it and no breakouts!",neutral
"i wish they never changed the formula, this moisturizer used to be my holy grail",negative
"i was so badly sunburned after using and reapplying this product about times throughout the day. the oil feels nice, but this is not a good sunscreen.",negative
i am not sure if i am fully convinced with this product so i will have to buy a bigger size to give it another try! but so far it has brightened my neck given i have hyperpigmentation and it has firmed my neck a little,neutral
i have try a lot of victim c glow serum before and this one i just did not noticed any difference in my skin at all. i found it took a bit to absorb into my skin which i found nice when i use my face roller.,negative
"i really like this peel! my skin is normal to oily and i get acne around my period or when i am stressed. this has worked well for my skin and keeps it balanced. it had a stronger scent than some other peels but i like the smell of it, and it has a refreshing feeling too! highly recommend if you have acne prone skin and are looking for a new product to try.",positive
i love this product because it is gentle enough to use every day without drying my skin or irritating it. it has the perfect balance of exfoliant so i can still use the rest of my skin care routine and this too. love the packaging which makes it super easy to use and you do not need a serum dropper. definitly shake this product before using.,positive
"soothing and refreshing but it does not quite do much of anything else. just nice after a long day, or nice to enhance a serums effectiveness.",neutral
"pretty good moisturizer. even with my dry skin it feels like this takes a while to sink in and never fully sets down. i think because of this greasy layer that remains on top of my skin it just feels like maybe it is not really being absorbed and so it just does not feel very hydrating. it is definitely thick and feels protective like it locks everything in, but i still need a couple hydrating layers underneath. so i wonder if it is worth the price? or is it doing what any old thick night cream does? anyway, have not really noticed a difference in my skin and will probably not repurchase especially not the!!! jar going into summer. also, the pump cap broke so now i have to unscrew the whole top to access the product. which is pretty unhygienic and also very difficult with wet hand. unfortunately sephora customer service was unable to help at all with sending a replacement so i will just have to deal with the inconvenience until the jar is empty.",negative
i am still not sure exactly what this product is supposed to do. it did not add anything to my skincare routine but it did not hurt it either...,neutral
was hoping this would help with just mild congestion but after finishing the bottle i noticed no difference whatsoever. and the smell is horrid.,negative
"this was underwhelming for me and i will not buy again. my skincare routine is pretty solid and i think my skin is probably at it is peak, so not sure adding anything at this point is going to make a huge difference. but i still get excited about finding that one game-changing product though which is why i bought the mini version of this with the lapis oil.",negative

"i have been using this caffeine eye cream daily for about a month now... i was quite intrigued since i had never tried any products from the inkey list before and the brand seems to have good reviews on several platforms. while i would describe this eye cream as more of a serum because of its consistency, it does not change the fact that it absorbs into my skin beautifully and leaves my undereye area smooth and moisturized. it is super lightweight and did not give me any milia or odd texture like some other eye creams have. plus, this product did wonders for the puffiness i usually have when i wake up! it disappeared within minutes, leaving the perfect canvas for my concealer... as for my dark circles, this did not make much of a difference at all but to be fair, my dark circles are hereditary and i have yet to find an eye cream that actually helped visibly brighten them without some sort of cosmetic effect. overall, because of the price point, effectiveness, and how little you need for each application, i say this is a great eye cream to incorporate into your basic skincare routine!",positive
i recieved this product free from influenster for testing purposes. this is the first guerlain product i have ever used so i was not sure what to expect. this has a very water consistency and a little goes a long way. it is heavily scented which is a turn off. it is a very floral scent. this product is super sticky on my skin. it feels like it never truly melts into the skin. it leaves a gross residue that lasts all day. i think this will work good as a primer. i am going to this is pricey for the product. i have been using it daily for weeks and have not noticed a difference yet. i would not repurchase this.,neutral
this was gifted by rose inc. i am really enjoying this toner. it is the first liquid exfoliate i have used and it will be a staple on my routine. it has a slight scent to it but not unbearable and is slightly sticky but once other skincare is applied you do not notice it.,positive
"these little guys are amazing. i have pcos and awful cystic hormonal acne. you know the deep painful ones? yea, it sucks. but these spot treatments are heaven sent. i pop one on over freshly washed skin and let it work its magic. if i can i will leave one on throughout the day which has been pretty regular with work from home happening. they are a light nude color which covers the redness on my skin tone which gives me a little confidence in leaving the house bare faced. if i do not wear it throughout the day i typically will put one on and leave it overnight. they work to draw out all the yucky stuff and leaves my spot pretty flat which is great if i feel like i need to cover up. it takes about- days of using this product to get the spot flat.",positive
"i like the concept of clean makeup. however, i do not think this product does it for me. it has a whipped texture when you first dip your fingers but i am not fond of the texture as it spreads. it feels almost chalky and hard to spread. i have tried whipped moisturizers by other great brands that are easier to apply. it is not the greatest under make upbb cream. my nose was peeling after.",negative

"this moisturizer has a unique texture. it looks thick yet has a cream gel like texture. it feels very light weight on the skin and adds the tight amount of hydration leaving the skin very glowy. it has a menthol sort scent which smells refreshing and feels cooling on the skin but it does concern me since i do not prefer fragranceessential oils in my products. fragrance is listed pretty high up in the ingredient list and it has a few sensitizing ingredients like eucalyptus globulus leaf extract. overall, will use this moisturizer but will not be purchasing once i run out.",neutral

"this cream is going to be a great one for all you normal to oily skin beauties, in my opinion. i have sensitive drycombination skin with rosacea and texture. the first thing i noticed about this product was that it has a potent smell to it. not necessarily bad, just very strong think lemongrass. it has a silky, light feel to it, yet it is also hydrating. i unfortunately had red bloches on my face the next morning, and it did not hydrate as much as i need. if you have dry skin, i would add a drop of your favorite oil to it.",neutral
"this product was alright. i have been dealing with flaky and extremely dry under eyes for months now, and it is not a skin condition. i was hoping this would help, but no difference. it is also too thick for my liking for undereye treatments. i like something that glides over the skin easily because i swipe instead of tap...i had a hard time swiping or taping this product in. it is just so occlusive. if you just want general moisture and you do not have a condition to fix, this might be for you. i would recommend it to a teenager or someone in their early s with no dryness around their eyes.",neutral
"i love some of the other drunk elephant products, but unfortunately this one did not do much for me. it is refreshing and felt nice when sprayed on the face, so it may work well as a refresher on a hot day, or sprayed on a makeup brush before application. however, for the price point, i did not personally find much use for me to purchase. my skin is pretty dry this time of year, and i did not feel it added much moisture to it, or much of a change at all. i did not notice a scent at all super mild, indistinguishable scent that did not linger, so that is a positive. the spray was average. it has some great and interesting ingredients such as kombucha and fermented sake extract, that would hopefully help the skin over time. i am on the fence as to whether i would recommend it, as i think it would be useful for some skin types more than others.",neutral
i use two other creams from ole and this one caused a major outbreak after just on use. not impressed. returning. will stick with the truth serum.,negative
"a watery, milky-clay formula with fine gritty particles that serve as exfoliators upon rinsing. it does a good job of moping-up oils without stripping my skin dry. it can be kind of messy but my skin feels very smooth after washing.",positive

"i absolutely love this product. i strongly encourage consumers to do their research before purchasing. this formulation is a very fine l-ascorbic acid powder. you will experience a slight gritty texture and feel that is normal. tingling is also normal. this is a high potency pure vitamin c that works great for brightening the skin, combating uneven tone and texture. i use this as a part of my nightly skin routine every other night. i do not recommend using during the day or under makeup due to its consistency. make sure you use sunscreen always when using this product. do not use in the same routine as retinols, direct acids or niacinamide.",positive

"i have never rated a product on sephora before but felt like i had to. this retinol is amazing! i saw results after just time using it. i have very dry skin in the winter, am battling mask-ne during covid, and my skin can be super sensitive to new products. the first time i used this was at night. washed my face and did- pumps on my faceneck. followed up mins later with moisturizer and went to bed. woke up and my skin looked amazing! it also helped with some of the acneblemishes. i am so excited to have finally found a retinol that works!",positive
been using for about a week and a half and it has significantly reduced the blackheads on my nose! you can barely see them and i think they will be gone in another week or so. the weird thing is it has not really done anything for the pores on my cheeks and forehead. i think the smell is pleasant but i would rather it be fragrance free. i like that it goes on like a serum!,positive
"i am a big fan of caudalie, as i know their skincare is vegan, clean and free from ingredients that are potentially harmful to our body and environment. their container and packaging also focus on sustainable sourcing.i received this freeproduct from trywithtopbox, i love the light lemongrass scent from the cream, the smell is divine and i feel very relaxed by massaging my face with it. it contains patented resveratrol, hyaluronic acids, shea better along with vegan collage. this cream aims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles on your face, i do not see obvious results about these as i am not at that age yet. but i have to say it is really good for softening the skin, filling the skin with a delightful glow, i feel my skin become brighter and smooth.i enjoy using this antioxidant firming cream, the quality is great compared to other moisturizers in the market. i will highly recommend it to my family and friends.",positive

"this could not be easier to apply which if you are feeling lazy or on the go, this is great. literally so easy to use this even without a mirror. so it is going to be my travel buddy this summer. but i will say this for me is like a targeted product because even though it is twice the amount of the po retinol eye stick it is going to run out fast if you use it all over your face. i have not seen a lot of improvement yet but i love how smooth the formula is and the ease of use. have not had an irritation this far so it is good for someone new to retinol.",positive

unfortunately this cleanser did not work out for me. i tried it at a sephora location using their sink to feel texture and how the product feels. i instantly fell in love with it! problem is i got major break outs that i am still recovering after almost a month of me discontinuing to use the product. while using the product i got painful cystic acne. would have loved it but everything from tatcha seems to break me out.,negative

"this is a very mild-gentle scrub cleanser. in fact, i think it it more of a cleanser than a scrub. makes a fair amount of foam, but the scrubbing part is too gentle for me. i like how it smells, and how it feels, but i would prefer more scrubbing. so, it is gentle, smells good, and feels like it really cleans as many soaps would do, but not much scrubbing.",neutral
"i really wanted to love this because it goes on so smooth and looks amazing. the tint is not enough to cover anything, but it evens out tone and adds glow. worked amazing under foundation too if you are looking for more coverage. unfortunately this made my drycombo skin peel like crazy. took a couple days to happen, but then it was a flakey mess even in areas i do not usually have dryness. i think the mineral sunscreen was just not a match for me. as soon as i stopped using it my skin improved. i would highly recommend this for anyone with less sensitiveoily skin because it did look beautiful at first, but definitely avoid if you have dry skin!",neutral

"i was so excited to try this product, and while it is a good size for the money, it is the consistency of a hard glue stick, and it does not soften up from the warmth of your skin. this means that it pulls and tugs on your delicate eye area, which defeats the purpose of a retinol eye stick completely. unfortunately, unless they reformulate it so that it softens, i would not recommend it. so disappointed.",negative
"i was gifted by the outset their firming vegan collagen prep serum is a nice lightweight facial serum that helps to immediately hydrate the skin. it comes in a nice heavy glass bottle packaging with an easy to use pump dispenser that dispenses a good amount of product per pump.i really like this product. the outset firming vegan collagen prep serum is easy to spread on the skin, absorbs quickly, and hydratesmoisturizes the skin without leaving any residue or stickiness.i would venture to say that this is my favorite product from the outset and i would definitely recommend it.",positive

i really like this moisturizer! i use a vitamin c serum and then put this over the top. i feel like my skin looks so much younger i am and it really helps with the fine lines. i have noticed my developing crows feet are more difficult for me to pick out in the mirror even on days i do not drink enough water... which seems like every day. i really like this and will be purchasing again.,positive
"i loved this product the first few week. it help me with dry patches and redness. after about a month, i notice my t zone getting more shiny, and small bumps start to appears. i also developed a reaction as my face turn red as soon as i apply it. i kept using it as i thought is was hormonal, but now i am dealing with huge clogged pores and breakout. i think it may be too rich, i will keep it as an occasional night cream. will see how it goes.",neutral
"these little duos are amazing. they definitely help reduce pore size and blackheads. they improve skin texture and overtime give you a nice glow. the only reason for a star and not a is the price and they are drying. so i suggest just using about x a week and build with your skins tolerance. also, it is definitely more of a night treatment. i find it is too drying when put under any kind of foundation and can cause dry patches.",positive
"i absolutely love this moisturizer! i have heard of it before, but the price was intimidating however it is extremely hydrating and a little goes a long way, so the price is worth the value! what surprised me was that it was thick most night creams are but it is so buttery soft and applies very lightly on your skin without being greasy. my skin was so dull and after using this for a few weeks so far, my face is plump, bright, and a lot of my fine lines are gone. a miracle cream! i would definitely recommend this sleeping collagen! i received this for free, but my opinions are my own.",positive

"this is just okay. i seem to break out more with this one vs the ren toner. this leaves my skin pretty dry which might be better for oily skin but i live in a desert climate so this is a bit too stripping. if you have skin on the dryer side i would recommend the ren toner over this, plus it is cheaper!",neutral
this mask does soothe and moisturize parched skin. i think people who left negative reviews generally had high hopes for it being able to offer more than what a simple moisturizing mask can do and got disappointed. it is no miracle worker but it does the job and i like that you can use it around the eyes and on the lips.,neutral

"it looks and feels like vaseline. it is not the white creamy texture from photos, but hard and yellow. i am not sure if this is even the real cream. i am really bummed and if this is supposed to entice folks to buy the full size i cannot imagine anyone doing it. the problem is i still want to experience the product- this just cannot be it.",negative
"i have been using this along with the skin hydrator. i am not sure if it has really been doing anything for me since i do not really notice any difference and my hormonal acne has been worse. the vitamin needs to be taken in the am with food, so that may make it a bit difficult to take.",negative
i am kind of on the fence with this product. at first the scent is nice and then when your applying it it is kind of strong and not so great. i personally think it is way to thick and kind of heavy feeling. it also did not sooth dry areas. the packaging is beautiful though!,neutral
"i love summer fridays and was so excited to try this moisturizer! however, this just is not working well for me as a winter moisturizer. my skin is lookingfeeling dry mid-day and at the end of the day looks sooo dry. i have not had my skin like this in months and so it is a little disappointing. i would use a heavier moisturizer for cooler months but feel this would be great in the summer months!",neutral
"this product unfortunately missed the mark for me. the part design and double ear loops are unnecessary, cumbersome, and made application time consuming. the ear loops pulled the mask causing it to tent from the bridge of my nose to mid cheek, so i spent my whole time wearing it trying to push the mask and product onto my cheeks and nose. the mask also caused a burning sensation at first. i have experienced the same with vitamin c masks but i was not expecting it from what i saw on the the key ingredient list. on a positive note, i did eventually experience a cooling and refreshing feel and was finally able to relax apart from the constant pushing of the mask onto my cheeks and after removal, my skin was soft and glowing. overall- it was fine but i think it is highly overpriced. for a fraction of the cost, i have had relaxing spa experiences with other easy to apply single sheet masks that have covered my entire face, felt soothingrefreshing throughout, and have left my skin equally glowing and nourished.",negative
"i bought this product due to my damaged skin barrier resulting from my retinol. i have oily skin but i still appreciated how soft my face would feel after using it it is a tad bit greasy though. however, my skin became quite clogged and started to break out. looking up the ingredient list i noticed there were pore-clogging ingredients so it was not best for my acne-prone skin.",neutral
"i have been using this as a first step in my cleansing routine to take off my make-up and sunscreen. it takes off every last bit of mascara, does not sting my eyes and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, but not oily. however, i have to make sure to rinse it off really well as it sometimes stays stuck to my eyelashes. i have sensitive, acne-prone skin and have not been experiencing any breakouts or irritation in reaction to using this. overall, does what it says it will, and for a great price! just make sure you apply it with dry hands on a dry face!",positive
while the product itself appears to work well and does not because me to break out i have normal to oily skin. the reason i am giving this product so few stars is because of the packaging. it is terrible. you cannot control how much you get out and end up accidentally dispensing way too much of the cleanser without any way of putting it back into the bottle. so you are likely going to waste a lot of the product. i only have mini size now but i definitely will not be repurchasing because i have no idea if the larger version would be any better and for the price i am not going to waste my money.,negative
"i received the ole henriksen c-rush brightening gel creme complimentary for sampling purposes but all opinions are my own. i wanted to test this moisturizer out long enough before giving my opinion, i received it on and i am now leaving my review on, i figured days is a long enough timeframe where if the moisturizer was going to negatively affect my skin it would have by now. let me explain my skin type, i am early s and i have oily, acne prone, porous skin. often if i use a cream based product it will build up and i will develop white heads, since the start of using the c-rush brightening moisturizer i have not had that issue which is extremely exciting for me! i use the moisturizer every morning before doing my makeup, and i have come to the conclusion this product is the reason why my makeup has been looking amazing lately. i wear makeup for about- hours a day and i no longer notice my skin getting oily or my makeup becoming cakey, settling in fine lines, or breaking up throughout the day. also this moisturizer smells absolutely amazing, nothing overpowering so if you are sensitive to scents i believe you would still be fine using it. testing out this moisturizer has made me very intrigued to try out the rest of ole henriksens truth collection their vitamin c based line and i am hopeful that the moisturizer will positively impact my skin in the long run, overall i am a huge fan!",positive

"thick creamy moisturizer that is super good for hydrating, but i did not notice any other benefits. so for the price, i would not recommended it as there are cheaper moisturizers out there that will hydrate as well as this e.g. freshs rose deep hydration moisturizer. since it is a thicker moisturizer, it takes a few minutes for it to absorb into the skin- you can definitely feel it just sitting on your face in the meantime. does not bother me personally, since my skin is on the drier side, but it may be annoying for some.",neutral
i cannot even believe the price of this stuff but it rocks. it is light and you do not need much. it is very hydrating and probably better for dryer climates but i do not know since i have not used it in summer yet. it has a smell of perfume like powderflowers which is gentle and not overpowering.,positive
"it goes on nicely, very smooth, but it does not do anything for my skin. the packaging is really cute--it comes with a little spoon for application and the top of the jar is magnetic so the spoon sticks to it. it smells like a cheese plate, which may be good or bad to you depending on preference. overall though, for the price, you expect it to do something. it was not moisturizing and i did not see any benefit to it. it did not harm me in any way though, i sometimes get breakouts and that did not happen",neutral

a lot of hype for a pricey cleanser. i will stick with my la roche-posay gentle cleanser. i felt like it really did not clean. i do not think this is good choice for skin on the drier side.,neutral
"i have used this cleanser for a little bit over a month now, and for me personally it is just okay. i looove everything about this company and what they stand for, and i truly believe that this cleanser works for others. for me, i think it is just a tad too stripping as it makes me have that slightly tight feeling after washing my face, leaving my face wanting to be moisturized as soon as possible. i have never broken out while using it but i do not think it has done anything spectacular to my skin. i wish yttp would make a cream cleanser, especially for us living in places with extreme climates, esp extreme new england winters.",positive
"as a serum stick, i expected to use this all over my face like a regular serum, but i find that not to be the best use for it. it is not very buttery or emollient so it is not east to spread over large areas. however, i like having this in my bag for when my skin feels dry throughout the day or my makeup starts to look a little crusty. i received this complementary from influenster, but i think that for the price you should get more product in the tube than there is, and the packaging could be nicer",neutral
"this is a very fine mist and sprays out evenly across your face. as a refreshing spray to use throughout the day, it does feel nice and luxurious. as a toner, i find it much too drying. and as a setting spray it does set my makeup initially, but i do not see much of an impact in the longevity of my makeup. overall given the price point, this is something that is nice to have, but definitely not something you need. there are other refreshing sprays out there for a lower price point.",neutral

i love the consistency of this mask. its a pitch black paste that layers so nicely and evenly. it stings a little bit on application but it does not hurt. my skin looks so much brighter and smoother when i rinse it off. i love how my skin feels after this mask. i will continue to use this and buy it! my acne is not super inflamed anymore and my skin is smoothing out.,positive
"i personally have combination skin and got acne on particular areas of my face while some areas are super dry. trying this cleanser was awesome the first days, after that my skin was so so dry, my skin felt so dull and itchy that i had to stop using it, after days of applying extra layers of moisturizer my skin was normal again. i only recommend this cleanser for people who have very oily skin. ps my acne did get a lot better.",neutral
"i received this sample size of estee lauder revitalizing supreme youth power creme l for free from influenster and estee lauder in return for my honest review of the product. i adore the consistency of the moisturizer as it is thick and creamy. it absorbs quickly and spreads across skin flawlessly. i was surprised that it layered well under makeup considering it is thickness. not only does it layer well under makeup, but it works great as a primer. as far as moisturizing properties it works very well. i have combo skin for reference, and my usual moisturizer is belif true cream moisturizing bomb. as far as a difference in fine lines, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and elasticity, i did not see a difference. since it was a sample size, there was only enough product that i could squeeze two weeks out. the only claim i can confirm is hydration. the amount of product listed in the full size is incredibly small considering they are charging for. ounces. there is nothing special in the ingredients list that warrants that. the belif moisturizer is still better and you can get. ounces for. you are literally paying for the price when it comes to this estee product and it is highway robbery. if there was something in the ingredients or if the product worked magic i would feel differently but for hydration only, i personally would not waste my hard earned money on this product. there are plenty of other options out there.",negative
i do not liked. do not have nothing in my combination skin,neutral
"i love tata harper and use most, if not all of their products but this one was a bust for me. it left a film over my face that started to eventually clog my pores. i also did not feel like the beads were exfoliating at all. will be a fan of the brand forever, but this product was a no go.",negative
"the product was mediocre to good, it was thick and had a very soothing smell, so it was very luxurious to add to my sunday self-care routine. however, taking off a star because the color of the mask is a little much. it stained a few of my make-up removing towels. glad i gave it a try but not a product i am crazy about",positive
it is very hydrating and gentle. i love the scent! my face always feels soft and hydrated after use.,positive
"this sleeping mask is wonderful. i have dry skin, and this really moisturizes my skin. i wake up glowing and not flaky.",positive
i just started using this so i cannot say too much but i just came here to say they mad over dramatic about the smell comments. its not bad fr i smells good to me lol,neutral
i absolutely love the pink packaging it is so cute. i have been using it for about a month and it has significantly helped my skin. it layers really well and does not pill off like some skincare. i love the serum but not sure that i would pay for it if i had to buy on my own,neutral
"this treatment has a slightly runnier than syrup texture that is easy to spread and effectively exfoliated my face and neck. for the price and the ingredients, this is a no brainer if you are looking for a medium aggressive chemical exfoliant.",positive
"i have been using this for about a month now. i have tried a lot of eye serums. i must admit that this is one of my favorites. i would not have bought this brand, but i received this to try. honestly i will be buying again. great serum. it keeps my under eye area moisturized and smooth all day.",positive
this product is great. i originally got it as a sample and loved it as soon as i used it. it is very lightweight but it leaves your face feeling deep cleaned and smooth. the scent is flora-esque but the scent does not linger. great for a morning face wash.,positive
triggering to me that this bottle does not lock for travel. every time i go somewhere it squirts all over everything and it is annoying and a waste of the product that i actually enjoy. i have tried a million times to lock and it just keeps popping back up,negative
i have always loved drunk elephant and this serum has done wonders for my skin. only from a few weeks of use i have noticed a big change in my dark spots and texture on my face.,positive
i do not usually write many reviews for the things i buy but i have not been more happy with my skin in such a long time. this product is great.,positive
"this is a gentlelight cleanser- its a creamlotion consistency so if you are looking for foamingdeep cleanse this might not be what you are looking for unless you use the second cleanse method. the price point and amount of face wash you get in this tube is worth it. my only hope is that they consider making a fragrance free option because it has a slight perfumery linger after applying to the skin. my skin is on the more drysensitive side so it does leave my skin a bit tight but no breakouts or bad reaction, its not bad but not great... i think this face wash would be suited for more normal skin type.",neutral
"i always love the packaging of kora products and this one is no different though, the size of the tub to actual moisturizer ratio is a bit off and i would not mind the overall packaging to be a smaller size since i live in a small space. the texture of the moisturizer is light, but i am not a fan of the scent. in addition, i have noticed a slight stinging feel when i use it though it dissipates quickly and does not seem to cause any other adverse effects.",neutral
i was sent these supplements complimentary from moon juice and i really enjoy the idea of this supplement and some of the ingredients online are said to help with stress and manage cortisol levels. i have not necessarily noticed feeling less stressed but i have noticed i do not feel like i have to take nap mid-day as often. i do find these to be a bit expensive but if they work well for you than that is your opinion on price point.,neutral
"this is my absolute favorite face primer and one of my top five favorite makeup products ever. i wear this daily, even if i am not applying any product over top of it. it is so moisturizing and really helps foundation apply flawlessly over my extremely dry skin. first aid beauty- do not ever discontinue this product!",positive
"i got this as a free sample and used it for about weeks. it glides on smoothly and noticed it leaves somewhat of a sticky finish but smells really good. into the nd week, however, i started breaking out. not wanting to blame it right away as the reason for my breakout, i continued to use it but ultimately stopped after a few more days with no let up on the breakouts. i got tired of the sticky finish as well. i did not feel refreshed after my skin care routine like i usually do.",neutral
"i can not say enough amazing things about these patches!! they really do work wonders!! these are game-changing because if you have a zit that was just popped, you can slap one of these guys on and go about your day while they do all the work! they are also easy to cover with concealer so you do not need to worry about ruining a makeup look. just remember that they need to placed on a zit that has just popped. they do not do anything on a normal zit because there is not anything to suck out obviously. for how well they work, i think the price is worth it and they come in small pouches so you can carry them with you on the go. recommend!!",positive
"i have previously used a few estee lauder creams, they have never disappointed me. i was glad to get a free sample from influenster. i have combination skin so i used this cream at night on top of my el night repair serum. i woke up with soft, dewy skin. i would need to use it a longer time to see if it firms and does other things. i really liked it.",positive
my favorite summerfridays product! it is my favorite travel companion and always helps my skin feel so pampered!,positive
"i really enjoyed this product! the applicator was cooling and made it easy to apply the right amount of cream to each eye. the cream is not sticky and lays well on the skin. i have not used this product long enough to see its effects, but i do like the ingredients list and feel that my under-eyes look very hydrated in the morning.",positive
"decided to try this serum as i saw many good reviews and recommends. i was sceptical as i have used serums in the past that were highly regarded yet had a bad experience skin irritation or minor breakouts. so far, i have not had this experience with this serum rather the opposite. after only a week of us only using it x a week i noticed a visible difference in my skin- i was really impressed. i was started to get very fine lines on my forehead, and after using this serum i noticed a dramatic difference- they literally started to disappear! i do recommend but definitely start off with a little and then build up the amount you use.",positive
i thought i would really enjoy this product but honestly it gave texture into my skin. it was mostly around my chin and i just felt like it made my face feel really dull.,negative
"i really wanted to like this spray. i used it over my makeup and all it did was turn it into a greasy mess. even by itself, it is still really greasy. i have oily skin to begin with and was hoping it would give me a glow.",negative
"am i the only one who is formula is gritty? i like the way it moisturizes my eyes, but there are little grains in it that are hard to avoid.",negative
i have been using this for years and absolutely love it! i have very oily skin and this is a live saver! especially working in a medically sterile environment where i have to wear a mask and goggles all day this saves me from so many clogged pores and breakouts!,positive
the product is light weight and goes on clear but i saw no difference at all. it did not irritate my under eyes or feel greasy but it just did not do anything for me,neutral
"this stuff i thought at first was just blah. but now i think it is what is causing my awful breakouts. i think i will just stick to the cleansing balm which i have found to be much much better! i will not be using this anymore to test if it is the issue, but have found this product does literally nothing for my combo skin.",negative
not seeing much of a difference but love the cooling effect.,neutral
i tried this product for almost months. it did not do anything for my skin. i noticed after the st week my skin was more oily and i got little bumps. i do not care for textured skin so that was kind of a deal breaker for me. i love the fresh rose moisturizer but i will not get the serum again.,negative
"this is an okay essence, it is not very hydrating after it sinks in. i hate applying it with cotton pads or rounds because i feel like it is a waste, so i have it in a mister. i have noticed a difference in my overall skin glow and tone, i am noticeably less red, more even toned. i later this under a moisturizer and sunscreen usually. my main complaint is the horrible smell. i know the essence is fermented, but it smells so awful, and it is very noticeable. it makes using it unpleasant and i am struggling to get through it. i have other mists and toners much more refreshing and pleasant to use at much cheaper prices.",neutral
"this did not help my redness at all and it made me breakout. azaelic acid the ordinary brand is so much better, it helps my redness so much it actually has gotten rid of my rosacea and it helps acne so so much.",negative
"i have struggled with redness for a couple of years now and this product works really well, i am delighted with the results.",positive
"i love this cleanser, the first one i have used that does not dry out my face when i use it.",positive
"i really like this mask. i bought it over years ago, and i am still using the original tube. i intended for this to replace my previous exfoliating product which i still have not finished. i find this really works well for my acne prone skin my skin is also sensitive to scented products and it does not break me out. i find this does dry me out so i like to use a moisturizing mask on the nights i use this product.one of the cons of this product is it is abrasiveness so i would not recommend this to people with dry skin as it will not be good for you my acne prone skin can handle it, but i do not want to continue using this product after i finish this tube. after learning more about skin care, i would not recommend such an abrasive mask to anyone. i am planning on switching up my exfoliating routine once i have finished the stuff i have open.",neutral
"it didnt hydrate at all, my face felt dry and it looked dry.",neutral
"i have not used this in over years but looking forward to trying it out again. when, i did have this i would use it almost every other day it helps control oil and suck the oil out of the pores, controls shine and made my skin super soft. one of my favorite masks ever!",positive
"i received this serum complimentary from sulwhasoo in exchange for my opinion. the packaging is nice, it is glass. the product itself is a thinner serum that absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice calming scent which adds to the relaxation experience. after about days, i noticed more refined skin, pores and minor flaws looked smaller and less noticeable. my skin overall felt healthier and more hydrated. i really love this product and think it is a great addition to my routine.",positive
"the product works fine, but it is not a magic fix. but my one issue with drunk elephant is that they have literally the worst packaging. i do not like the aesthetic of it particularly, but that depends on the persons taste. what i take issue with is that it is impossible to tell how much product you have left, as someone who travels regularly over periods of time that last about a month i do not always have access to buy a new jar whenever i run out. and it is annoying to pack an extra just because you might run out. while i am writing the review under this product it is true for almost all their packages, including face creams, masks and eye products.",neutral
"i have tried many things from the herbivore line so far and this is my least favorite so far. i am not really sensitive to smells but boy this stuff smells truly awful. i really do not understand the reviews saying that it smells good and that makes me wonder if some batches of the product are turning bad. i have to cover up the scent by putting on some mario badescu rose toner right after. as far as balancingtoning benefits, i have not noticed anything worth writing home about. the stars are for the clean ingredients and packaging.",neutral
its a great sunscreen with no white cast leaves healthy glow but does not mix well with my mac studio fix foundation makes my foundation separate. only reason i am retuning it.,neutral
"have not noticed a difference while using it for almost months, and the pump is starting to leak from the sides- very messy",negative
"ok ok... these are my fave hydrocolloid acne dots, but i have a few addendums. first, have no idea how you use these without popping a zit... i have only tried it a handful of times, but never did... anything... and these are too expensive to waste so i cannot speak to that. so i use a tissue or something to gently pop a zit, then apply this immediately after. get all the blood and junk i can, gently, then put a sticker over it. but also... looks like many people have complained that these are too sticky hurt their skin. sounds very plausible but never happened to me since i oil cleanse with jojoba oil and then apply lotion... i am just like... all wet... lol in a good way seems to work as a night routine i wake up and my skin is pretty dry in a good way and always looks better than the night before. but so... my face is oil city... freshly oiled and moisturized and all wet before i use a clean cotton shirt or tissue to pop a zit--then i apply these acne dots. when i do all these things then these work way better than those unmedicated hero dots and these weird ones i got from another country. the tiny wound from popping looks way better--on those occasions where there was not much left, looks very not noticeable the next day--the times where there was still white junk in there, these babies are killin it, doing essential work pulling that out. may need to use another the next day for a big one after oil cleansing and moisturizing again but these really helped to get the crud out. so tldr if you going to pop zits which you should not... if you can live with them for- days they usually go away without scarring but if you have a zit at night and need it gone by the next day will leave tiny wound, but way more healed and not noticeable than if i popped and did not use an acne dot then most of the time this will work wonders. they are... very expensive.. but if you can afford it, real talk these work the best for me at healingtaking away inflammation from those tiny wounds overnight",positive
tried it twice did not see any difference the next day. first time i tried i thought i did not put enough so i tried it again two days later. nothing. i think i looked worst like i did not put on face cream and went to bed.,negative
what a waste of money! it does nothing. this is literally snake oil!,negative
"i used to love this moisturizer. they recently reformulated it, and made it less gel and but still not quite cream. my face is having small breakouts, it feels heavier on my face, and my skin is oily shortly after i put it on. i feel like i need to wait a few minutes for it to dry before i put my spf on. the new formula is definitely thicker and if you loved the product before because you had oily skin, then i would not recommend it. i tried to give my skin a few weeks to get used to it, but it just does not work for me anymore.",neutral
"do not quite understand this product getting any negative reviews. i hate stinky sunscreens that leave residue and are hard to blend into skin. this product has no scent at all. it does not because break outs on my dry, acne prone skin. i can use it like a highlighter ontopp of makeup for a glowy shine. sinks into skin while remaining dewy and protects my skin from the sun, what is not to love?!",positive
great product but if you do have extremely reactivesensitive skin the concentration of ha might be too strong for you. this product caused a stinging sensation for me because high concentrations of ha can make your other products penetrate the skin too deeply if you are prone to barrier issues. i would say this product is more appropriate for those with oilier skin.,neutral
i did not see much of a difference in i have been using this for a while.,negative
"this stuff is seriously amazing! i have struggled with acne, texture my entire life and this has truly helped! it does sting the entire mins but your skin feels so fabulous after",positive

"i never break out. ever. i am, however, plagued by dryness and dullness. this product somehow both broke me out and did not hydrate my skin at all. i have never once had a skincare product do this to me, and i consider my skin pretty non-sensitive.",negative
not worth the price at all. has a weird unpleasant scent. did not clear skin at all and very drying. tried using it every other day to reduce dries but still did not work.,negative
i wanted to like this product and i think it might do well for others however after using a few orinary products that i really do like. buffett side effect every single time is a migraine. it took a few times to narrow it down to the bufett specifically.,negative
i have oily sensitive combination skin and i tried this cleanser. it makes your face feel clean but if you take a cloth and wipe your face there is still dirt there.,neutral
i have no clue why this product has such a high rating. i have oily skin but i honestly do not feel this doing anything for my skin. it is like throwing creamy water on my skin. hahaha. luckily i just had a sample of it and did not want any money on it. worthless!,negative
very soothing and calming for the skin. it is smells not great and similar to paint or plaster. the scent lasts for a prolonged period of time which is not ideal. the texture is of a thick cream and it comes in a tube packaging. this was gifted by dermalogica for my honest review.,neutral
"i love that these products are straight up about their ingredients so you can make an effective regimen!! i have been using this for a couple weeks, so i am not sure about if there is lasting long term benefits.immediately after applying a few drops, the pores on my nose look smaller and my skin feels smooth but not tight and dried out! i would buy this again for sure!",positive
this is honestly one of the best moisturizers. it is so healthy and clean. definitely worth the price,positive
the texture of this eye gel is perfectly lightweight and feels slightly cooling. it absorbs fairly quickly into the skin. and it definitely does de-puff. after using morning and night for days i noticed my right eye had some little bumps under it. i stopped using for two days and they went away. i now use this eye gel every other morning with no issues. but maybe it is a bit strong for sensitive skin. i love the cool refreshing feeling it gives my eyes on early work mornings. overall i like it just not for twice a day use gifted by dermalogica,neutral
"i have used a whole tube of this now and it is okay.i like the texture and that it is not sticky as most gel creams can be. it does not make me break which is great, so when i do get the occasional breakout it is not aggravating it.i am just not super impressed with it. i also do not have sensitive skin which this product is geared toward, so maybe it works better for people with sensitive skin?",neutral
"the most middle of the road moisturizer i have tried to date. wanted something more affordable than my much-loved de la la retro for the winter, and since i am a caudalie fan, gave this a whirl.is it as moisturizing? no.is it good for daytime? no, the biossance omega repair cream is better.for the price, it does the job for night time hydration. but, it seems to make pores more prominent on my combosorta oily skin in daytime under makeup. will not purchase again. would be good for skin that is easily sensitized, as what little fragrance that exists is light and did not irritate my skin at all.",neutral
does it work? yes but you cannot really apply anything below or above... so what is the point? i may have missed something or wasted my money.,negative
"the ultra fine mist is great and hydration boosting was about average. the scent however was far too strong for something that is intended to be sprayed multiple times a day. it smells like watermelon candy, like a jolly rancher. the scent also lingers so everyone around you will also smell your watermelon candy scent. it is too juvenile for me, so i will be returning it",negative
"for my normaloily skin without any problems i.e. acne, scarring, etc i did not notice any benefit after using this product twice daily for a few weeks. if you do not have a specific skin problem, i would save your money and buy another less expensive toner or essence.",negative
on good skin days i wear this as my only foundation. it blurs imperfections and gives a natural look. it is a perfect blend of hydration and natural finish- not matte and not shiny.,positive
i love this product! i have bought it several times. it melts the makeup and sunscreen away without leaving my skin feeling dry.,positive
i have been using this serum for a week am and pm. it is been nice addition to my skin care routine. my skin feels smooth and nourished. too soon to tell is it helps with wrinkles and pigmentation. but my skin feels noticeable softer and smoother. the purple pearl finish helps with redness and mixes welll with foundation. the serum was complimentary for testing purposes.,positive
"this stuff is amazing! the first few times i used it i had some tingling and redness, but now it seems my skin has gotten used to it. my skin is so soft in the mornings after putting it on the night before! i would not recommend it to people with sensitive skin but everyone else, it is worth the price.",positive
"i have been using tulas clear it up cleanser for the past few years when i started getting breakouts in my mid twenties, but i wanted to try this cleanser out as it is much more affordable. unfortunately this product did not work for me. as others have stated, the consistency of the product is a little strange- it does not lather easily, you really have to work it to get that nice lather. also, it left my skin feeling very dry and it really dried out the area around my hairline and made it itchy. it might just be because my skin is used to the tula cleanser, but i have used other cleansers while traveling and it did not have that effect. i probably will not return because of the low cost, but i would not recommend this product.",negative
"i am disappointed with this product would not recommend it to anyone, i only used it times the bigger size came of the handle sucked!!! i am still using the small size. i would store my money for something better!!! if i could i would not rate this thing",negative
super overrated! i used it for over two weeks and it would tingleburn when i would put it on but thought my skin just needed to adjust to it. instead it just broke me out. i have pretty normal skin that tends to be sensitive at times and at the time was dehydrated and this product just made everything worse,negative
"this oil is thicker than other cleansing oils that i have used. it does not have much slip to it so i feel like i am always going back for more product so i do not stretch my face too much while i clean it. i was out of the cleansing oil that i normally used so while i was traveling, i purchased this one. it did not take my waterproof eyeliner off like i was used to. i will not be repurchasing this.",neutral
"texturefinish the first thing you will notice is how smoothing the serum is as the very first ingredient on the list is cyclopentasiloxane which is part of the silicone family, known to improve spreadability of product and smooth the skin. silicone is not a bad word to me- just noting here that the presence of it was an immediate observation. having said that, it spreads incredibly well onto skin and may even act as a primer replacement for your makeup routine in the morning but be wary that it does not play well with all makeup so you will need to test which product work well with it. my liquid blusher made it pill on my skin for example but my foundation was fine. scent smells very herbal, i like it but this depends on your own preference. packaging the bottle has a spatula wand but i wished they made it into an airless pump instead as it makes no sense that you would use the spatula on your potentially dirty hands or face and then insert it back into the bottle and letting any germs fester. for a product, this was an absolute miss. results skin did feel firmer and more bouncy but would this be worth a bottle? no. for the retail price though, i expected more thought would have went into preserving the product longer as mentioned under packaging. i was given a free sample in exchange for my own opinions for this review. product was gifted complimentary.",neutral
"i absolutely love this. i have sensitive combo skin. i was not sure after the first couple of uses because it burned, but i used an aloe mask and had no irritation after. tip hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! your skin will thank you after. my serums and masks have been way more effective since i added this to my routine. this even helped clear up closed comode acne and has been a game changer.",positive
i wanted to love this cuz i love my other paulas choice product. but i have been using this for a few weeks in hopes to get rid of my dark circles and am let down. i like the consistency and it feels very moisturizing but i have not seen any difference in my dark circles. for the price i would not recommend.,neutral
"i got samples of this and i really wanted to love it. after one week most people here talk about the smell, but i did not really notice anything. what i did notice is that it does not sink into the skin, it just sits there-- like at some point throughout the day i would touch my face when i had not put on make up for the day and i would feel it on my skin in the afternoon still just sitting there, grease box slick feel. for the first time in a year i broke out with little tiny white heads in places where i do not ever break out. for that reason i rated it poorly and i will go back to caudalie all day. never should have switched. i am now reluctant to try other products from the brand.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from farmacy beauty. this toner is absolutely life changing for acne prone skin. after literally one use, i woke up the next morning with my active, inflamed spots significantly smaller in size, i was floored! after using it for about a month, all of my active spots and trust me i had many flattened and healed. this is my new favorite toner and i am absolutely obsessed with it. the packaging is amazing, it is non-irritating, and so effective!!",positive
"thought i loved this, but got red bumps in many spots on my face. turns out this has coconut oil in it. very surprising as i think of farmacy as a very good product line. anything for the face should be non-comedogenic. if they remade this without coconut oil, i would retry it.",negative

"i am so so sad to write this review. i bought it having a very positive mentality that this product would help my skin. instead, it irritated it so much that i felt more acne coming up. i have normal acne when the time of the month comes or when i eat stuff. i do have oily skin. it was supposed to smooth my skin and remove dead cells. maybe i exfoliate my face enough that i do not need this? overall, i wasted my money. and this is not cheap. i regret buying.",negative
packaging is a. scent a. but the real tea for my combo skin is this. it felt like it did not soak sink into my skin. it made my nose tzone feel oily and heavy. on top of that it made my skin feel like there was product just sitting on it. almost greasy. i have cheaper moisturizers that do way better.,neutral

awful. i have oily skin but do not usually get blemishes. full breakout from this cleanser.,negative
"i really enjoy the texture of this product, being on the thicker side for a toner but not too thick. it absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. i honestly have not been using it consistently enough to notice if there is been any change in fine lines or pigmentation. this product is very heavily scented, so probably not great for someone who is sensitive to fragrance. however, i do not find that the scent lingers throughout the day. unsure if i would repurchase due to the heavy fragrance and price point, but will see if it is worth it once reaching the end of the bottle",neutral

"amazing!! i never write reviews on here, but i had to for this product. i have very sensitive oily acne-prone skin and this product did not break me out. it reduced the appearance of my fine forehead wrinkles and my hyperpigmented acne scarring. it definitely has a strong rose smell to it, but i actually really like it... i am in love. i will definitely buy this again when i run out.",positive
"this is the product i was not expecting to be the way it ended up. genius sleeping collagen by algenist is a super creamy and very thick night cream. it has very little in the way of smell or scent and when applied it feels similar to a smoother and buttery noxema. the texture upon first glance and application is luxurious. unfortunately, that, to me, is where the positive qualities of this cream ends. when massaged into the skin it is very oily and the residue is almost unsettling. nearly immediately i wanted to wash it off and instead chose to sleep in it overnight. after waking up in the morning the very first thought i had was to get it out of my skin. while there was no redness or irritation my skin felt very heavy. i am not sure if this was just my experience or the experience of others but this is not a product i could recommend. i would not go out of my way to purchase this product again.",negative
broke me out like crazy! i have used it for a week and it broke me out. let my skin reset to make sure it was the sunscreen. wore it again for a week and it broke me out again. painful clogged pores and i do take good care of my skin and remove makeup or even just sunscreen properly at the end of the day.,negative

"i have not personally noticed a huge difference when using this product consistently for the last week so i wonder if maybe i would need to use it longer to see any significant results. on the plus side, i like how it feels on my skin as an extra layer to my current skincare routine, so i think i will try it for longer and see how i feel about it. i was provided this complimentary from influenster to try and review.",neutral
has been really helpful with my maskne overall breakouts. with it being an oil i find it helps not dry out or irritate the problem areas but genuinely treat them with put dehydrated the skin around. for daytime use sometimes i mix a couple drops in with a moisturizer if there is others serums i am wanting to mix in! really enjoying the product will be repurchasing!,positive
"i love glow recipe- truly- so i was so excited when this came out. i switched out my tatcha cleanser to try out the blueberry bounce. there is nothing bouncy about my skin after using this cleanser. it has dried me out so badly and has given me weird bumps and texture that i have never had before. i tried to limit the use to see if that helped, and in times i was not using it, my skin improved. every morning after i used this my skin was tight, and my under-eyes look like they have aged years. i wanted to live it, but i will sadly be returning. i give it two stars because the packagingscent is nice but could be causing the issue- i do not know? and it removes makeup well. might be good for someone with ultra oily skin?",negative

"i noticed a difference with my blackheads after the second use! it is like they all came to the top of my skin and were easy to pop! i use before bed every night and my only problem with it is when i rub it in, it kind of reminds me of a cleanser but i do not care because it works amazing. i know it will last me a long time because a little goes a long way",positive
the pros for me was that it made my skin soft and i really liked the smell. other than that it did not really work for me. it just irritated my skin. if you have sensitive skin i would not recommend this.,neutral
it has helped with a mild case of dermatitis but i did have to seek out a prescription to clear up perioral dermatitis.,neutral
"if you do not like strong scents i would not recommend this, it takes off your makeup but a balm would be better than this. personally love the foaming cleanser but i do not really like the oil cleanser.",neutral
"hey beauties!! i am beyond obsessed with this watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer that glowrecipegiftedme!this fabulous silky glow moisturizer is spiked with ninty percent vitamin and amino acid-rich watermelon extract, plumping hyaluronic acid yes please!, and soothing botanicals like peony and jasmine extracts.this oil free cooling gel emulsion absorbs instantly to seal in hydration and prep skin for the day ahead, making it the perfect lightweight moisturizer for oilycombination skin. the antioxidants guard against free radicals and repair damaged cells along the way. when used in the morning and at night, it drenches skin in luscious, long-lasting moisture.first, i am so in love with this product. i absolutely adore the gel texture. it is so lightweight and smells great! this is perfect for florida weather. also, i am really enjoying this moisturizer as i just had oral surgery so it is quite refreshing and cooling on my face. you can find this fabulous skincare treat at sephora! this lovely product is cruelty free and vegan! products shownglowrecipe watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer",positive
"mediocre- while its not bad, its what you get for the price. i noticed a slight difference but nothing extreme",neutral
i actually like the cleanser. the issue is that it due to the thick consistency it is clogging my drain!,neutral
not the cream for me. i tried a heavier cream after moving to the dry desert climate and ended up returning it as it did not seem to keep my face moisturized for more than a few hour and i believe it was the culprit a few break outs.,neutral
"the face cream is very hydrating and light. i love that it does not make my skin feel heavy, and it works with my combination skin. my skin does not feel oily after applying it, and my dry areas are visibly softer. it does not really have a scent, and it does not really matter because the quality of the products high. definitely recommend!",positive
"would highly recommend this if you have dry skin. for oily skin, you should spritz lightly after makeup as i find it absorbs into your skin if you excessively spray and it undos all the baking to stay matte. however, i still use this to get that fresh, non powdery look. it gives a very dewy and glowly look",positive
received a free sample size with my purchase and i think i am going to have to give it to spend on a full size bottle. i am super oily around my t zone and i felt like this cream went on so smooth and made it feel nice and soft. a little going a long way. i definitely like.,positive
"ultimately i think my headline sums this up. i personally found that this product did not do anything extraordinary for my skin. i have used other hyaluronic acid serums my favourite being glow recipes plum plump and felt they delivered night and day changes. often times i think the cost of the product is reflected in the quality. there is absolutely nothing wrong with this product and if you have a small budget, i am sure it is great. but i think it is worth it to pay a bit more for better results!",neutral
"i saw this product named frequently by users on tretinoin forums as their holy grail. whatever, i can afford it so i bought it. i have a step routine in the morning and the last step before sunscreen of course was a moisturizing cream. i replaced it with this de protini. it went on well but by noon i saw dry patches and peeling coming through around my mouth, nose and lower jaw. with my cream i do not see any peeling or dryness until at least which is okay because i get off at. maybe it will work for those of you not on tret but for me, it was a big let down and not nearly moisturizing enough. i am sticking to vanicream.",negative
"i wanted to love this, reviews were so positive, but it did not work well for my oily skin. i am usually blemish-free, but i have been getting pimples on my forehead and cheeks since starting this, which i really did not expect. i usually use the clarins double serum which is way better.",negative
i have been using this consistently-x a week for about months now my skin is used to retinols and not sensitive and i see no changes to my skin in texture or discoloration despite also being religious about sunscreen. at least it is not drying or irritating...,negative
"i love face mists and have many many different kinds. i was excited to the might tatcha mist... it did not meet my expectations. it feels sticky to be honest and not refreshing at all. other products can do a better job at a lower price point, not worth it.",negative
"i cannot tell if i love this product or not, i was debating between a or but it does lean more towards a. it moisturizes so well initially and feels like a spa treatment but it kind of soaks up fast and dries up on the skin quick and no longer provides hydration atleast that is what it feels like, maybe it still does granted it does say hr moisture. but to the touch of my skin it will just feel dry. not that my skin is still dry, but as if i did not put on anything. i personally like to keep feeling the hydration on my face though, so maybe that affects my opinion. this product also never caused me to breakout which is a plus, but its such a simple product that i kind of worry that i should switch to something that has more skin benefits. i might try something else and come back to this product. its definitely worth to try because its genuinely nice, i think this is a great beginners moisturizer!",positive
"helped fade away my post breakout dark spots and helped even out my skin tone, one of the best vitamin cs in the market!",positive
"received this in a sample size in a sunscreen kit! was not a huge fan of how it felt on my face so i used on my hands, decollete, and neck because i hate wasting product. there is a pleasant fragrance not sure how describe it. left a shine to the skin",neutral
okay will totally admit to buying this because the name was cute but i actually love this stuff. i have super dry skin and this stuff is really hydrating. knocked off a star because it seems to pill slightly but not enough to be a deal breaker. only need a tiny less than pea sized amount so the value for the price is good. would recommend and will repurchase,positive
i just want to say- i never write reviews. also i am the cheapest person ever. but i wanted to try this mask--because of the reviews. truly i have never seen such a change in my skin so quickly. i have been using this mask for weeks and not only has my skin started to clear up but the texture has improved overall. i have never spent so much on a mask but it is worth every penny. i will be buying again and also checking out more of their products.,positive
"i do not use clay masks too frequently these days because my skin is now more dry and not nearly as acne prone as it used to be, and i find clay masks have a tendency to dry my skin out. this clay mask however, is not nearly as drying. i only applied a super thin layer on my face with more focus on the poresnon my nose. it was easy to spread on your face without getting super thick or heavy. washing this off was a relatively quick and painless process. i noticed my skin did not feel dry or tight afterwards and my skin felt smooth. my pores also felt a little less clogged.i think if you are looking for a clay mask that is on the gentler side and have sensitive or acne prone skin, this might be the mask for you! freeproduct",positive
"i got a small size of this in a set. i was excited because the reviews were so good. i have used it a few times, and it is so sticky on my oily skin. it spread fairly easily and did not leave a white cast, but it definitely did not absorb quickly. my face was still sticky long after application. maybe this is just because of my skin type, but i think it is going to be hard for me to use up. i will probably try to pass it on to someone with dry skin.",negative
i received this for free from influenster and wanted to give my honest review. all i can say is wow. this product is amazing! i have combo skin and this gives my skin the dew look without making me even oilier! if leaves my skin plump and ready to go. i have been using in the am and pm! definitely will be purchasing!!,positive
it smells like the icing from a dollar store gingerbread house.,negative
"great for your skin. works on oily skin, reduces acne",positive
"nothing, does not reduce swelling, or redness, or size.",negative
"this eye cream feels incredible on the skin! it is so silky nourishing without feeling cakey. i even used it under makeup my under eye looked so much more hydrated and had less creasing after use. unlike other eye creams, it did not break my skin out, i have very sensitive skin. application is simple- just pat a small amount under your eye all done! it does not take much. i received this product as a free sample, and i am so glad i did!",positive
"i have used this product for a long time because it lightened my acne scars and balanced my uneven skin tone. it seems like the formula has changed. the oil used to have a thicker consistency and was yellow-toned. the oil now is almost color-less with a watery consistency. this was my holy grail but sadly, with the formula change, the oil is not working for my skin anymore",negative
"it has a great coverage for a cc cream, but it feels so heavy on the skin, it is drying and it is really hard to blend.",negative
i agree w the other comments. this product is soooo oilygreasywatery. it comes out of the bottle as an oily consistency even after shaking it. i rub it on my face but cannot get it to absorb completely and it just feels like i am rubbing oil around my face. of course after wearing it all day at the beach i come home and shower and find my face covered in pimples. i will not be applying this product to my face again.,negative
it works well for double-cleansing. i do not wear make-up but i do wear water-proof sunscreen and this removes it no problem. it does not wash off that well so not my favorite oil-based cleanser but it is decen.t,neutral
"as a long term review reader and skincare junkie, but never having posted much about products, i have to say, this is the best oil i have used for a nighttime skin care routine. i have used sunday riley ceo, ufo, luna, as well as other retinol based oils from the ordinary, and biossance oils like the tea tree oil and the vitamin c and rose oil. all are great but pale in comparison to the effects of this oil, which is incredible considering the price. it is rare in my opinion to get this quality for this price for a product that has vitamin a retinol. as someone with hormonal acne, i notice that this is the only oil that never breaks me out, likely due to the high linoleic acid content! i keep trying other products but come back to this as my holy grail oil, on my third bottle. it smells like omega-, which makes sense because that is the fatty acid in the product, which has not been degraded by heat as it is cold pressed. if you do not like the smell, mix a drop with another probably less potent oil! lol. it also absorbs fairly quickly and i always notice my skin is glowing and clear in the morning. i use sunday riley good genes at night as well which is iconic on it is own, but have gone without it on and off so i am confident this product stands on its own.",positive
"i received this product complimentary of influenster. i always love trying new products for my face! i know a change in face products is usually a good thing because your body gets used to routine. i am always super weary of new oils though because i have oily skin and feel it might make it oiler. this did not do that. it felt like it melted right into my skin and and made my face feel refreshed. the only thing i did not really like is it has a little bit of smell. it smells like oil, like olive oil. i am not sure how to describe it. it is not overpowering but i got a little in my nose now that is all i smell",positive
"le produit sent tres bon, mais je nirais pas jusqua dire quil est different des autres savons doux que jai essaye...",positive
this serum has quickly become part of my day and night skincare routine. i have combination skin and it is the perfect balance of moisturizer and oils but lightweight enough that i do not feel like an oily mess. it just sinks into the skin and gives an all over dewy finish that looks so healthy and glowy. it wears wonderfully under makeup and makes my foundation look even more dewy so i feel youthful and plump. the rose smell is pleasant and not too strong. you only need a few drops in your hands so thing will last you a long time.,positive
"i want to start by saying how much i love de products. i have used the entire skincare line at sephora and none of it irritated my highly sensitive comboacne prone skin. however, when i realized that they are packaging is not recyclable i was devastated. how can a company who prides itself on ethicalsustainable sourcing not be conscious of their packaging?! every single de product-serums, moisturizers, eye-creams, a-passioni, scunscreen, everything-ends up in the landfill which to me is unacceptable. as such, i have switched my entire skincare regime to herbivore who use glass containers which can be upcycled. really hope de aligns their production ethics with their ingredient ethics.",negative
sad to say this one made me breakout big time. oh well! not all products are for everyone. maybe my pores need to be bigger to expel badness.,negative
"this eye cream is the most aesthetically beautiful eye cream that i own. the purple swirls are captivating. it also contains star ingredient bakichiol which is a retinol substitute. my skin is very sensitive to retinol so i was excited about trying this. however, after a few weeks use i did not notice a huge difference. my personal preference is creams over than gels, which this one is and i just do not love it unfortunately. i will keep on using it and see if there is a difference made!",neutral
the new packaging is really bad. the lid is flimsy and falls off easily. terrible for traveling with. i like the cream though.,neutral
"do not use it everyday!- times a week works, it gets everything out and leaves skin looking greatt!!",positive
i saw this on tiktok and wanted to give it a try. however this product was terrible. i do not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. this made me purge and breakout all over my face. this brand is overhyped.,negative
great product! i enjoy a thicker consistency eye cream and this one feels very hydrating without being greasy. i also love putting some around the mouth for those stubborn laugh lines.,positive
"i have been using this product for only a few days, i received it complimentary from influenster and i wanted to give it more than a day. it has a smell that i had to get used to initially, but ended up sort of enjoying. my skin felt super soft immediately after using and then went to bed and in the morning still felt super soft and my skin has been less oily than usual but somehow still super moisturized. incredibly impressed with this product and will definitely recommend to others.",positive
"the packaging is really cute, it comes with a small spoon to scoop the cream out. the smell is very subtle and floral like. i only gave it stars because of it being heavy on skin, very sticky and you know that there is a cream on your eye and its a minus for me. but after using it continuously, i can say that it really helps improve the fine-lines around my eyes.",neutral
"meh. honestly, i did not really see any difference after using this mask. it goes on really dewy and starts drying almost as soon as you apply it. the packet said wait min before washing it off. my face felt very dry after... i really wanted to apply a heavy moisturizer because my skin felt so dry and i have very oily skin normally.",neutral
"a must with microneedling. i cut mine in half to last longer as the pads are super saturated. moisturizes and calms. i only use these when i needle, which is only once a week for my sensitive skin. since i only use these to prep x a week, they should last quite awhile.",positive
i wanted to love this but i have not noticed any changes. it goes on smooth and feels hydrating but gave me slightly dry skin after.,neutral
i do not write any kind of reviews but... the bottle was half full and the dropper does not work!!!!! how will i be able to tell if it works if i cannot get it out of the bottle and to my skin!!!!,negative
"i bought a mini one to test because of all the hype surrounding this product. as any mist, it is the same as spraying water in your face, does not do anything regardless of beforeafter make up.",negative
"so i got the point first aid beauty kit at checkout because i have had good experiences with the cleanser and ultra repair cream. i was excited to try this out because i have only ever used scrubbing exfoliates. as soon as i swiped this over my skin, it got super angry and red. it definitely was not an allergic reaction, but my skin looked so ruined. it is been a week since i have used it the one time and the angry redness is still there. i am super disappointed and i am not sure what happened.",negative
i am super picky about the products for my face but this one is a keeper! the scent and texture are great. my skin feels moisturized and refreshed. it is my new favorite!,positive
"for me, this product does not do anything. neither good nor bad. my under eyes look just the same as if i used nothing at all. it does not seem to play well with makeup it tends to pill when i apply powder. i am giving it two stars because it does not burn my eyes and it does not have an intense smell like some creams.",negative
the texture is a mix between a serum and a lotion. fries sticky like most vit c serums. i think this caused some massive redness and tiny bumps around my mouth so i have stopped using it. i did like it other than that.,neutral
"honestly, this product is amazing. it changed my life. i have had pretty significant hyperpigmentation around my mouth and chin areas for a long time. when i was younger, i thought the more i scrubbed with grainy exfoliators, the better it was for my skin. i was dead wrong and my sensitive, prone to hyper pigmentation skin immediately started to darken to a greyish tone around my mouth and nose. i have fair skin, so it makes the hyperpigmentation all the more noticeable. i tried everything to get rid of the dark, greyish patches. i eased up on the exfoliating, which helped prevent it from getting worse but it did not get lighter. i tried lactic acid toners, ahas, bhas- everything that said it would help. nothing did- at least not enough for me to continue using them. i was cripplingly insecure because i hated leaving the house without full foundation on- and i am otherwise a person who regularly goes out without makeup. then, a friend recommended i use vitamin c. this product happened to be one of the first results i got after searching in sephora, and honestly i got so lucky because it worked and its amazing. this is one of the very few vitamin cs that is formulated to penetrate to the deepest layer of your skin not even the drunk elephant one is formulated this way. after applying twice a day for weeks, i have already seen a significant improvement in my skin! my chin and upper lip have already returned to their natural color, matching my cheeks. i still have dark, greyish strips around my chin, but i am confident those will fade completely with time, as they have already gotten noticeably lighter. it also lightened my dark circles, which i have always had super dark eye circles no matter how much sleep i have gotten. i can go out now without foundation and feel okay! it is amazing. you need to massage it into your skin and have the product be warmed up by your hands. this way, it will get fully absorbed, will not be tacky, and will not break you out.",positive
this sunscreen made my forehead break out in little pimples. i only use it on my body now. disappointing for a sunscreen. i have combination skin but my forehead is not particularly oily.,negative
"i have been using it for a couple of weeks now, the product feels nice, it leaves a sparkly finish, the applicator feels great on the skin but so far i have seen differences.",neutral
did not seem like it was that special. i did not notice a special softness or plumpness.,neutral
"i have super oily skin, but also aging concerns so in the winter i like a thicker but well absorbing night cream. this stuff still feels tacky on my face an hour after applying. a little does go along way, and it has not caused me any issues, but i just do not like the way it leaves a film on my face. many have commented on the smell it is probably a little stronger than you want for a face cream, but i am obsessed and i wish it came in the hand cream i would buy a gallon. a little citrusy and sweet. if it came in a candle i would be super stoked.",neutral
"i switched and thought to try these compared to the peter thomas roth cucumber patches but i prefer the former. it is very slimy and it is hard to pick up with the spatula and tears. i feel like it is very greasy and slides under the eye area i had to keep adjusting it. i did notice that my bags were lessened and my under eye area more plump and youthful. but i think i will stick with the cucumber patches when it runs out, which will take awhile because it comes with so many patches",neutral
"i like the formula of this product. it has a brightening effect and is not too greasy or too lightweight. however, it is not enough for me to repurchase as the packaging could use improvement. usually eye creams last me several months and this is the first one that did not. when i thought i had used it all up, i was still able to scoop out quite a lot more product hanging out at the bottom using a q-tip. the bottle needs reinvention but the cream itself is nice. there are plenty of eye creams on the market with better packaging that i would prefer to use rather than fighting with this one and replacing it so frequently.",neutral
"feels great upon application but face feels tight and dry after a few minutes. thought this would be good for my oilycombo skin but it was not moisturizing at all. i also thought this was a gentle, calming moisturizer but then realized this has lactic and citric acid in it, so it made my skin worse after i realized i have overexfoliated from a different product",negative
i love this!! i am nervous trying new products as i have oily sensitive skin so when i saw this was oil free i had to try and was really happy with it. its very fairly priced for the quality of product and lasts a while!,positive
"this feels great on the skin after washing your face or throughout the day, but i am not convinced it is doing anything beyond that. i have used it at least once a day got about a month.",neutral
"my skin just does not like it, i feel like when i use it- times a week i break out more than when i do not use it. it has nice ingredients just bummed it did not work for me.",neutral
"according to their website, there is a special routine you have to follow when apply this eye cream. i used it for months, but i did not feel anything.",negative
"i am almost done with my first bottle and i have to say that i will definitely be repurchasing. as long as i used it as directed, the appearance of my existing fine lines and wrinkles was softened and kept at bay. for reference, i have mild wrinkles on my forehead, under the eyes and mild-moderate parenthese around my right side.",positive
this product has made my skin amazing!!! i recommend to anyone i know who is into skincare! ride or die type of product for me!,positive
i really wanted to love this product. and i did enjoy using it!! i like this brand a lot! love the cleaner ingredients. but something in this product caused the skin in and around my eyebrows to break out badly. i cannot get this sensitive area to clear up- even after discontinuing use. unfortunately this product just did not work for me.,negative
i think this is a good product because it moisturized my under eyes and gave it a luminated look. i also like that it is a clean beauty product. i do have dark circles which i was hoping this would help with but i did not notice any improvement so because of that i would probably skip on this. it did not have any scent or leave a greasy feeling which was nice. i personally do not have puffiness under my eyes so not sure how this would help with that but for my big concern of dark circles this did not really do much. so i recommend this if you need a nice under eye moisturizerluminizer.,neutral
"its definitely does not irritate the skin and helps soothe, so a night time product would be good. however, i have combo skin so i feel like during the day it does not sit well under makeup.",neutral
"i have been using this facial cleanser for years now and i really do think it is the best. i do not really have acne besides a couple pimples here and there so i cannot speak on behalf of that, but it does clear my face up whenever i use it consistently. i am talking like porcelain doll skin clear. a little goes a long way, which makes it last for a long time. a bit expensive but definitely worth it!",positive
i received this product for free to test it. i am glad i did. i have used it every night before bed for the last two weeks. i just started seeing a difference. my eyes look and feel brighter. i love that the product is green and a cream. the colors helps to see where i put it and the texture keeps it in place. it does not drip all over. i plan to continue using.,positive
"i did not expect to like this as much as i do. my skin gets dry, flakey patches randomly and it is very sensitive. this is amazing for combination skin because you can easily use this in a very targeted way. it instantly relieves the feeling of tightness and soothes the area. i do not know what it does long-term, but i think it will last a long time. it is a favorite.",positive
i was really hoping to like this to replace a more expensive vitamin c i have been using. i tried it on my forehead alone for a week and i broke out with new pimples everyday. i removed this and went back to my previous vitamin c and the breaking out stopped. it has a very oily texture and will make your hair oily along the hair line. it also becomes very warm to the touch as you rub it into your skin. does not feel great on the skin.,negative
"as someone who suffers from eczema i was really excited to try this product. unfortunately this tube is essentially a trial size, it is so small. it would probably last me about a week. i would not recommend this to anyone who truly suffers from eczema because the value is not there and it is not a miracle product.",negative
"this sunscreen contains zinc oxide, avocado oil, and vitamin e. it lightweight and does not leave a white cast on my skin. it also fragrance-free and does not break me out. it is not drying, but it is not oily either. this works great on my skin, i do not have to worry about white streaks on my face.",positive
"i got this as a free sample, and i wanted to love it but unfortunately it was just not for me. the consistency was great, kept my skin moisturized but unfortunately, i had a reaction and periodically would get tiny red itchy bumps on my face. along with that, this would pill on my skin.i do think this would work for most people though, my skin type drydehydratedsensitive was not the best fit",neutral

i tried this item as a free sample and i absolutely love it! i am someone that does not wear makeup very often and i use this every morning once a day. i can truly see the difference what i love most is that it leaves a light golden color under my eyes that makes my eyes and skin really pop. again i only use this item once a day so i can only imagine what it will look like if i used it twice or more a day. a little truly goes a long way so the sample lasted me a week. i already placed an order for the ml bottle cannot wait!,positive

"amazing!. i do not wear makeup but do double cleanse at night to properly remove spf and this does the job well. i seemingly react well to squalane but would not hesitate to recommend this to someone with sensitive, acne prone skin as the first step in their cleansing routine. i often give my face a- minute oil massage with this to release oil plugs and it does the trick.do not get it in your eyes. if you have got eye makeup on go in with a wipe first.",positive
i applied it one time and by skin started burning. it may be to strong for my sensitive eyes.,negative
brightaway contest complimentary olehenriksen influenster so far i am enjoying this very much it has great packaging and smells amazing. it is not oily and feels good on the skin the only issue i had was it came out a bit runny but other then that i am loving it and if it work as good as i think it will i plan on purchasing it when i run out of this.,positive
"sticky, if i rubbed it in for too long it just started peeling off of my face. weird texture, felt like it just would not absorb i to my skin. i did continue using despite the texture did not see any noticeable results either. i have others from this brand that are awesome- skip this one.",negative
i had such high expectations for this after reading the reviews. i saw no change in my skin after months of using it.,negative
"overall not my favorite product. i have extremely dry skin and notice this to dry it out a lot more instead of hydrating it, which i need. the smell is tolerable but not my favorite. i have very sensitive skin and am always nervous to try new products, especially because my skin will breakout occasionally. i do love the aesthetic of the product such as the bottle.",neutral
i have lupus so i have to be really careful of what i put on my skin. when my skin is really irritated i put this calming relief cream on. it is fragrance free which my skin needs and there is a cooling effect. i keep mine in the fridge and use on all my sensitive spots. i have even used it on my legs!,positive
"i love the packaging of this product, maybe it is because my favourite color is green. this product is very smooth and cold feeling on the skin and it feels great on the skin. i love the fact it can be used both in the am and pm. i noticed my skin was softer after using it. it is formulated for combo or oily skin and helps diminish the look of pores. i could tell it really does instantly hydrated my skin after applying. i highly recommend this product!!",positive

amazing for taking away surface redness. i use it every day!,positive
"i got this product of the recommendation of a beauty advisor while picking up some other stuff. just finished the bottle and ordered a second! i love it-the way it feels when going on, afterwards my skin felt supple and smooth, and i truly see improvement when using consistently aka i had some nights where i was too lazy for my routine and i could tell the difference lol. definitely would recommend",positive
this was not for me though it feels nice. you are supposed to put it on before any other products and let it fully absorb for minutes. that was not great plus i was just shiny. also does not really go well on top of make up so hard for reapplication. i think this would be great for people with more melanin in their skin who do not want a cast or people not wearing makeup but for me their other products are much better.,negative
"bought this with my own money this is not a free review. i like the moisturizer but it definitely is not a long lasting hydrate. i usually use tatcha dewy and at first by the finish i would say this could be a dupe, but i wake up and my skin just feels so dry and i really do not even have dry skin. it is a nice thick texture but i would not repurchase and will be going back to my original",neutral

i got a free sample size of this eye cream and i am definitely coming back for more! my under eye area gets so dry when i use other creams but this one is very moisturizing!,positive
i was very surprised at how well this worked against my sensitive skin. it is normally difficult to come by a scrub that is not too rough and this one did just that! it was super gentle but did the work.,positive

"gifted by tower beauty. this serum claims to best for a compromised skin barrier. i try to keep my barrier healthy, so this serum is designed to help me maintain that. it is a light gel texture that smells a bit like sea water, which is actually very pleasant. it does not really feel soothing, but it is not irritating. i think this is best for barrier repair.",neutral
i received this product for free from influenster to test out. the scrub has a scent to it but it is not overpowering. i have to use this scrub twice to get the clean feeling on my face though.,neutral
"literally the best day cream ever. i tested like all the brightening and depuffing creams and this one by far was the best at noticeably reducing my puffiness and make me look more awake. its so worth it, trust me!",positive

"i used two samples a couple months ago and really enjoyed the consistency of the product as an overnight mask. it was heavy and sunk in overnight leaving my skin super soft in the morning.there was a slight tingle and peppermint smell that was refreshing. i bought the full size yesterday and was eager to use long term. however, the product is so lightweight now! it sinks right in and provides some softness and i guess will work as a good daytime moisturizer, but i really wanted this as a nighttime mask. plus the peppermint and tingle are non-existent now. pretty sure i will be returning, which is a bummer. really want the product from the sample. i have sensitive skin, but have not experienced burning issues.",neutral

"i received this product complimentary from influenster and jlo beauty for testing purposes. i used this with the blockbuster wonder cream for days now. the serum does make your face soft and minimizes pores. however, i have sensitive combo skin and i did experience itching on the nd day of use. i also started to get small rash like bumps around my mouth and cheeks. rd day the itching stopped but still had the bumps and discovered small red pimples on the tip of my nose. th day the bumps are still there but the pimples are gone and my skin does feel soft and plump. i used two pumps ampm and it does gives you a glow as it says. i love the look of the bottle as well. i do feel though that her products are for mature skin as it is meant to tighten and lift. it may be a little too strong for me but my mom loves this serum. also, there is no scent.",neutral
i am not really sure that this is doing anything for me. people say i have nice skin. i have been using it for months.,neutral
"the texture is very light and pleasant but takes a bit of extra rubbing in to sink into the skin, but nothing crazy. i will definitely keep this in my routine as i think it has made my skin look overall healthier and has improved my skin barrier, but i cannot say i have noticed any decrease in redness.",neutral
i got this in a voxbox and was not a fan of this. it made my skin feel tight and itchy but did not glow at all. i tried it with a serum after and without anything else afterwards. i did not like it either way. i was not a fan of the smell either. would not recommend this product.,negative
it definitely takes care of dark circles for me. i do not like eye creams that are too rich or light. what is the point of eye cream that absorbs instantly and leaving skin parched up? this feels perfect for me going on rich and smooth when applied then leaving the skin moisturized without greasiness afterwards.,positive
not sure if it is working or not but it feels refreshing to put every night,neutral
"this product is good, just not for me. i think this is more geared for people that wear makeup. as i do not really wear makeup day to day, i do not find that this product does anything for me. i use it at night as a first step with my skin routine and i use it while in the shower. i definitely recommend following the instructions and using with dry hands or the product with thin out.",neutral
"this cleansing balm is pricey, but it is so worth it. it smells citrusy, but it is not overpowering. it feels so smooth while you are massaging it in, and it lathers nicely when you emulsify. i have acne-prone skin and it does not irritate me at all. a little goes a long way with this product.",positive
"i recommend you buy the small one first to try it out. i am glad i did. my face has been really dry and peeling! so you know i need a good moisturizer. i tried this, and unfortunately it made my skin so oily! although my skin is so dry, it could not absorb how oily this cream is. it made me break out which is pretty rare for me. the texture is nice, the smell is pleasant, but for someone with combination skin i would definitely try the smaller version before committing to the large one first. additionally, if i rubbed it in too much, it starts to pill and clump. i have not used it under make up yet because of quarantine, but given the pilling i do not think it would work well.",neutral
"ugh- it pains me to say this but this was not a good match for my skin. i have normal to dry skin, little to no texture- and rarely break out- even with continuous mask usage hours a day i am a nurse i did not have any trouble with breakouts. just occasional hormone breakout that cleared over night. after using this cream twice- my skin went from clear to hot mess express- i had multiple breakouts- forehead, cheeks, chin, almost like cystic acne, i got large lumps under my skin that grew into yucks- i literally had zit stickers all over my face to cover them at work. i gave the cream a break- as my usually skincare regimen had not changed beside the omission of my normal cream for this, let my skin clear up and heal, gave it another whirl a week or so later and same thing happened- only worse, i had high hopes for this as it is an expensive product and usually with facial care you get what you pay for so when i had this issue i was so disappointed. my coworkers commented on my skin and how bad it looked and asked what was going on. i enjoyed the light fragrance and it was not heavy or greasy, however something just did not mesh with my skin. i would like to give it another go when it is cooler- fall winter- because my skin usually gets extremely dry does not everyone is and see if that makes a difference, maybe it is just too moisturizing for the summer months. this is just me- i am sure other people have had excellent results. i would have given it a one star simply because my face was so sore lol however i love it on my decollete- have not had any break outs or issues there at all and it truly is very hydrating and a nice feeling cream. a little goes a long way as well which is nice. love that the brand is clean beauty.",neutral
i did not hate this serum but i did not find it did much or benefited my skin much. it did not break me out so that is good. i would give it a try but to be honest the cocokind barrier serum is half the price and noticeably makes my skin feel more hydrated,neutral

i have been using this for about weeks now. it is just okay. i have not noticed any difference in my skin and i thinks it has an unpleasant odor.,neutral
terrible product. it does not remove makeup. it leaves a slimy mess. i am going to stick with origins frothy face wash. it is a stellar product in comparison.,negative
this product acts as a tinted moisturizer and sunscreen in one. i struggle with redness and discoloration and it instantly blurs both of these issues. i wear it alone or under makeup as it has a concealing effect. the only complaint i have is that it leaves my skin greasy so i would avoid if you have really oily skin.,positive
why must companies change a great product?? this was my favorite. used it regularly for a year. the texture of the new recipe is completely different and has a horrible smell!! it is a much worse product now. sad to say i will be returning and i will not be buying again. major bummer because the old stuff helped my skin so much.,negative
shocked at how effective this is! one little cotton round of it left my face feeling baby soft the next day. note this will dry you out if you are not used to aha exfoliant. do not use too often. i like to use this once a week and a more mild aha chemical exfoliant throughout the week.,positive
obsessed with this product. i purchased some months ago with still a ton left in the jar. price is great for how long it lasts. i have dry and oily skin and this gem paired with the lapis oil is everything my skin needs to glow and feel like a babys butt. be warned though i am not sure this would feel great on sensitive skin. i do keep it on for the full minutes but i do not have sensitive skin!,positive
"i was hoping for a less pricey alternative to my la mer eye cream. i got a generous sample of this, and did one eye la mer and the other tatcha for a few days. sadly the results with the tatcha were not as good. i made my husband tell me which eye looked better and he said one eye had two lines under it while the other only had one.i still love the tatcha exfoliant though. that stuff is awesome.",neutral
honestly the best mask i have tried! i like to mix abit with a heavier moisturizer creamadaptogen and i have almost hours of hydration! second tub here i come,positive
i bought this for my teenage daughter and she has seen a tremendous difference with breakouts. very impressed! this is an instance where the high price tag is worth it.,positive
"the packaging and the bottle are very pretty, and it definitely looks cute on my counter, but i am so unimpressed with this. i bought this along innisfree face wash and i find myself reaching for those times. this does not feel like it does much, smells pretty whatever, and left me pretty underwhelmed. i really do not think i will buy this ever again.",neutral

great deep cleanser. i am not acne prone but i do get random pimples occasionally. i use this cleanser two or three times a week to get a deep pore clean out. works great without stripping the skin.,positive
i have been a fan of this product for years and love the updated packaging... i love how i can wear it on says when i do not want to wear foundation and still feel like it is covering some of my uneven skin pigmentation... blends well and love that it has high spf protection!,positive
"it is so strange because the newly-reformulated vitamin c moisturizer in the ddg line i find to be completely non-irritating amazing at hydrating brightening my drysensitive skin. as much as i wanted to love this eye treatment as i do so many other products in the ddg line, this one was just not for me. it because the corners of my eye bottom of my upper eyelids to turn redinflamed with little tiny bumps. i can use it anywhere else though like my neck or hands without any irritation whatsoever- just not specifically around my eyes. they are insanely sensitive to most vitamin c products anyway, so i am not surprised. all in all, if you are not sensitive to ascorbic acidvitamin c, i bet this would be a great eye cream. i am still giving this stars simply because the ingredient list is top notch my partner loves it and has not experienced any irritation using it whatsoever.",positive
"i could see immediate results with less congestion in pores and smoother skin surface the night after i used it. however, i would not recommend this for everyone if you are new to using actives, have an impaired skin barrier, andor do not have a solid moisturizer occlusive to use after using this, i would say not to buy it. could definitely disrupt the barrier if used improperly. have not tried it as a spot treatment yet",positive
"i trust allure and this face wash was recommended by a youtube i really like which was why i switched from the biossance oil cleanser to this. there is no scent and i like that it rinses off with cold water but this caused my skin to become red and irritated. i have drier skin but not necessarily sensitive. this had me red until i realized what item in my skin care routine was causing this. in comparison to other oil cleansers like biossance and tatcha, i do not think this product is worth the hype or the price",negative

it is not a bad product it just did not do anything for me. i did not notice any results.,negative
"i was pretty excited about trying out this toner since it is alcohol free. however, i have not noticed it doing much for my oily skin in my month of use, other than causing some mild breakouts. i expect that with new skincare though. i took off a star because it did not control or minimize my oiliness at all. by noon every day, or earlier, i was having to blot my face. i was so oily i could feel it and be bothered by it. this product should not be marketed towards oily skin. i will say it is a very comfortable toner. it did not because skin burning and felt super soothing going on my sensitive skin. it dried pretty quickly as well. this is a pretty pricey toner for the amount received too.",neutral

"i have been using this for a few months now and i am glad i waited this long before writing my review. i first ordered the smaller size in august and fell in love with the product. mind you, the weather was hot and humid and my face was normal to oily, but heavily oily in my t-zone. on the parts of my face that were normal it just felt good on my skin, it did not dry me out or make me oily. on the oily parts, however, it did have a very wet look, but this was nothing a little powder could not fix. i did notice as the day went on, my face got increasingly more oily, but i just blotted more, and it was fine with me because i actually received compliments on how great my skin looked when i was wearing this. that small jar lasted well over a month and i purchased the full size before running out in october. since this product did make me more oily than others i have used, i assumed it would be great in winter, when my skin is much more dry. unfortunately, when winter hit, this product became unusable for me. i am a tretinoin user so my skin gets dry in winter and i have a few dry patches i have to moisturize heavily. no amount of moisturizer could prevent this product from sucking every ounce of moisture from my skin, which made no sense as when my skin was more oily the product increased the oil production on my face. i have tried dozens of combinations of moisturizers with this cream and it is just not something i can use when my skin is dry. it works really well on the areas of skin that are perfect and already balanced. but if you are oily, it will make you look more oily, and if you are dry, it will make you drier.",neutral
"if you actually wear the recommended amount of sunscreen on your face and neck to get full protection, this product is not for you. i did not mind the glow but the product looked super patchy and pilled like crazy. you could actually see the curdles of sunscreen on my face and neck. bummed out because i was so excited to try this product in hindsight, everyone i have seen use and love this sunscreen only applies a tiny pea size amount which at that point the sunscreen is hardly effective.",negative
love!!! i have used many nighttime products and this one is probably the best. my skin is brighter and clearer than its ever been. i am in my late s and i have seen better results with this than i have with any retinol product. highly recommend!!,positive
"i have dry, sensitive skin with no acne. this product made my face break out in small, red, hives. i am writing this review, so people who have only tried a lightly formulated lactic acid treatment should spot test this before going full face. this product is very potent.",negative
"if you do not have this product integrated to your skin care routine, you need to change that. the product itself comes in a grainy powder, with the slightest oat like smell. when using it, i place a nick size portion in the palm of my hand sprinkle some water droplets and rub in hands first. once i get it to the desired consistency, i rub on my face, starting with my t-zone and work my way outwards in circular motion. the remaining grains dissolve once rubbing in on my face. this exfoliator does not strip the oils off the skin in a harsh way, it does quiet the opposite. my skin feels rejuvenated and cleansed after every usage. i loved this product after the first use. i was skeptical at first simply because i generally lean towards grainy exfoliators. i thought that the grainier the exfoliator, the more effective. to my surprise, exfoliators do not have to be harsh to be effective. this product has honestly changed my idea of a great exfoliator.",positive
this product does not show any different to my skin,neutral
absolutely in love with this product! it instantly made my skin feels so soft and smooth the next morning. i only use the pads at night and then follow it up with my skincare routine. i love adding a face mask because i will wake up with beautiful glowing skin! my skin type is normal so i decided to try the universal daily peel pads. i tried the treatments and now i am going to get more! super excited by the results i am seeing! this is a must for your skin!,positive
"i bought this, grateful that there was an affordable moisturizer when i was on a fixed budget. but... it is such an odd moisturizer. it comes out of the tube thick and creamy applies the same, even if you have a nickel-sized amount hello, white streaks of excess product on my face!. yet, that thickness the effort rubbing it in do not guarantee me moisture all day. i have had to reapply with this in the winter and, having taken it on a beach vacation, had it feel too thick greasy. i think it takes a while to find the right balance with it for your skin needs you certainly can. if your budget is low, it does not hurt to try it find that balance. but if you can afford to spend more, there are other moisturizers with less effort similar if not better results.",neutral
"this was not the eye cream for me my undereye area is extremely sensitive and after about a week of using this every night, my undereye became extra sensitive and even putting concealer would sting. it is a retinol though so i will continue using it twice a week instead of every night! hoping i can see results that way and not have to worry about sensitivity because the beforeafter pics for this for others are amazing!",neutral
"i got this as a gift, and while it does the job okay i am glad i did not buy it myself. it is a little too pricey i am going to, and does not do anything spectacular for my skin so i will not be purchasing one when my current jar is done. i use it as my daytime moisturizer over hyaluronic acid serum, and it keeps my skin hydrated and i have no bad reactions to it. but it also does not do anything for my redness, no glowy-ness from it, no extra soft skin. it just moisturizes decently and that is that. i do appreciate that it is unscented, and did not irritate my sensitive skin further though.",positive
"i have had great results with every mj product i have tried, so anticipating the same with superbeauty! was really excited to see glutathione and astaxanthin included in this",positive
this eye cream is actually beautiful. it is hydrating and feels nice on the skin. the reason i am only giving stars is because about the second time i used it the lid cracked and after using scotch tape to hold it together it continued to crack and break so now the lid kind of just rests on top of the jar. for the price i would expect the packaging to be impeccable. while i love this eye cream i doubt i will repurchase due to the cheapness of packaging.,neutral
"i was really looking forward to using this product because it has such great reviews. i have been using it as a first step in double cleansing and it just does not get everything off like i want it to. i even took my makeup off with micellar water first, and then used this to get rid of anything else i may have missed, and then cleansed with a water based cleanser and still saw makeup rub off on my towel. so sad.",neutral
"this cucumber clean eye mask is messy and although it moisturizes the eye area, it does not last very long. i wound up having to apply my under eye cream soon afterwards.",neutral

i ordered online because i can never find them stocked in store! if you wear the recommended amount of spf this is a must! it is only and the only product that does not dry out my skin from double cleansing. plus it can double as a mask! very nourishing..,positive
i did not really find it helped the dryness of my skin. my skin looked pretty crusty after applying this,negative
i found this product difficult to use. it did not really spread easily and took a lot of elbow grease to work into a lather and get completely rinsed off the skin. it does work well to break down makeup but found it too cumbersome to use.,neutral
i have to admit this is a great product and has helped with my acne and redness. but this is literally a glorified saline solution that you can get for less than at any store. the bottle is nice with a good sprayer head but this is definitely not worth when i have basically already had this type of product in my first aid kit,neutral
"i love this serum use it in my morning skincare when my face needs an extra pick-me-up, for example, if i forgot to wash my face the night before, if i have been more oily or if i have had to wear my mask more often. in the full size, you only need pump to generously pat in all over the face neck, full pump if you are using the mini version. i use the bigger size to refill the mini bottle so that i can use the mini bottle when i travel. i also use the ole henriksen products in the same line with this, all the orange ones.",positive
"i have been on a search to try another self tanner other than my go to tropez and purchased this due to good reviews. the product does go on very evenly and does develop fairly quickly but the undertone is very orange. i would say i am pretty medium skin toned and tan easily in the summer. the color was a miss for me, very unnatural. the tan did last nicely for a couple days but then came off terribly. i rarely have patchy self-tan spots on my skin while fading but noticed my neck had splotches after three days. the unevenpatchy fading is why i would not recommend this product.",neutral

"this product was fun to use but was not anything special. it smells lovely and my face was very smooth after one overnight use, but i ultimately do not think it justifies spending. i feel like i could have been just as satisfied with a cheap one-use mask from target. i received this product for free in return for my honest reviews of the product.",neutral
horrible! it broke my skin out so bad. it has a fragrance and it is super oily. never buying again,negative
this cleaners surprised me. i have very sensitive skin. i was scared that this cleanser was going to hurt or dry out my skin. but it did the opposite it does not leave me feel tight or dry it just makes me feel clean.,positive
i absolutely loved this product at first. but i cannot stand the container. i am about halfway done and the texture of it is changing. it seems to be drying out and getting thicker. it does not go on as easy as it did when i first got it. they need to change the packaging! why not put it in a tube or something so that it does not drythicken up so quickly. it is a shame because when it was new it was fantastic! stars all the way!,neutral

"i purchased this since it does not have hyaluronic acid or sodium hyaluronate, two ingredients that dry out and irritante my skin. first of all, this smells fine, just like any other unperfumed product. i do not get the hate. regarding the pumppackaging issue that others have mentioned, storing it upside down solves the problem.as someone with dry skin, this is absorbed within seconds and leaves the skin feeling tight. i need to apply a heavier moisturizer or skin oil right afterwards to fix this. i do believe peptides are useful ingredients for long-term skin health, but the moisturizing element is so minimal here that you might as well use a serum if you prefer that kind of formula.if you have oilynormal skin, i could see this working really well for you, but otherwise i will not be repurchasing and will just receive my peptides in a serum instead.",neutral
feels great but so expensive and not worth that price. also my container came half empty which sucks,neutral
"i received this complimentary from influenster! i really like this brand, and the serum from the same line is great! this cream feels nice, and i like that it has spf which is always useful. it appears to be thick, but it is actually breaks down like a lotionserum, so it will absorb into the skin fairly quickly depending on the amount applied. i do not like that it leaves my face a little oily. i think the price is about average for the brand, and the container is pretty big compare to other sephora brands for ml. however, i am not super in love with this cream in comparison to other creams i have tried. the added oiliness to my skin is kind of a bummer for me. i think this is a good buy for dry to normal faces.",neutral

this product was gifted by murad. i have blemish prone skin and a couple times a month tend to get those deep under the surface type bumps that just take forever to go away. i was so excited to see this treatment and could not wait to try it out. this contains salicylic acid and i think that may not have been strong enough to work for me. typically that strength is what i use on spots that are already to a head or have already been popped and i need to reduce the redness and inflammation fast. i have found that for me a benzoyl peroxide works better for subsurface bumps. this one did not help to reduce any of my deep spots but did help to alleviate a couple minor bumps that were already up. if you have similar skin issues to me you might want to skip this one.,neutral
i got this sample already after one night of use my huge skin irritation from retina looks so much better i will purchase the largest size as my skin is extremely sensitive this might be my go to savior.note apply after a few serums but several hours before bed to be sure it is fully absorbed does not rub off on your pillow. that is how i used it it fully absorbed no residue came off,positive

i have been looking for ways to cut the cost of my skincare routine and when i saw hyaluronic acid for only i figured you cannot go wrong with at least trying that. i have used different ha type serums for hydration by other companies caudalie and drunk elephant and found them to be really awesome adds. they add so much moisture and bounce to your skin and help the products on top go a bit further. that was not my experience with the ordinarys ha. ordinarys ha tightened and dried my skin literally the opposite of what ha should do?!. and i could not put any products on top of this without the ha pealing and rolling off on my face with little chunks everywhere... gross.i firmly believe that everybodys skin is different so my experience might not be the same as yours. but i also firmly believe that you get what you pay for and i will probably just toss the remainder of the bottle as no stores are open to return to and is not worth mailing back a return.,negative
"if you are looking for a cleanser that is gentle, this one will do. it is not my most favorite, but it will definitely do the job of removing the remainder of makeup and dirtoil from the face. i enjoy the thick texture of this face wash as a little goes a long way. i am not particularly into the scent. i received this complimentary product to test and so far, it has not irritated my acne prone and sensitive skin, which is always a plus for me. i will continue to use it as it is gentle enough to use as an everyday cleanser.",positive
i really love how thick and moisturizing this is. it feels super nice on my skin. i like the tube packaging but the cap keeps shedding little plastic pieces into the product. i am also not a big fan of the scent. it is kind of smells like decomposing bananas to me. i also wish this did not contain coconut oil because my skin does not react well to it.,neutral

"i really wanted to love this, but if you have sensitive skin just avoid. my skin is red and irritated immediately after!",negative

"i have tried more than a dozen eye creams, so i was pleasantly surprised to see summer fridays make a game-changing addition to the category. never before have i seen an eye cream with natural light reflectors that give the cream a shimmery quality. i was initially concerned that it may look artificial on the skin and make it seem like i have spread glitter under my eyes, but that is not the case at all. it gives the under eye area a very natural dewy illumination. even though the eye cream has a thick, buttery texture and is very hydrating, it still absorbs quickly and does not feel heavy or greasy. it has a subtly sweet scent and a peach color that gives a slight tint to the under eye area, which is perfect for color correcting dark circles and looks natural even on my fair skin. it also works great under make-up, preventing concealer from settling into my lines and not causing any pilling.",positive
"i got this product free from influenster. overall, i am not impressed. i would not buy again because i have used better scrubs that are less harsh on my skin. if you have sensitive skin watch out and i would recommend only using once a week. i used this for a few weeks and it broke me out. it also made my skin really red. i was so disappointed that it broke me out i really wanted this to work.",negative

"this is just okay. it is pretty dewy, which is fine for me because i have dry skin. the alcohol smell is strong, but i did not find it drying. the major drawback is that you cannot put it around your eyes. i found that it ran into my eyes almost immediately, which i did not expect from a product advertised as a face lotion.",neutral
"irritated skin with tiny bumpsrashes all over face. i have extremely sensitive and dry skin and after uses i noticed my face was itchy and dry. then tiny bumps started to appear all over my chin, cheeks and forehead. i feel disappointed because i thought it would be safe for sensitive skin. someone left a review saying it might be clogging pores and that seems to be true.",negative

"i had been waiting for the release of this item with baited breath, and i bought it the day it came out. fresh hardly disappoints, and the words strawberry and scrub were just music to my ears. expectation was so different from reality however, as i found the product to be subpar from their usual offerings.this is one of those scrubs that leaves a filmy feeling on the skin... my skin neither felt polished or smooth. but more like every piece of lint in the room would attach itself solely to my face. i did not get much of a strawberry fragrance from it either, so i was a bit confused what i was really buying here.",negative
"i soo did not want to like this at all but i do now i am hooked on an expensive water smh...but it does work the hype is real. as a first step in my routine it helps so much alone and it helps even more for my other products to do what they need to do. i decided to try it really because of its limited ingredients and fillers. i figured, if it is only active ingredient works for me then its a good active ingredients as this product technically is water and the fermented ingredient.",positive

"i have extremely dry skin and ofcourse this is not the best product to use for dry skin. as my the person who did my facial at sephora, this brand products are not recommended for use on dry skin. it smells nice and leaves your skin feeling fresh and new, but it also takes away a lot of your natural oils that you need. so basically good for oily skin- not good for normal or dry skin.",neutral

"i bought this from pcs website, excited to try it, but it looks like it will have to be a no for me. i have combooily skin, i also have a tendency to get oily in the area right below my eyes. i use this product once a day on an average of- days a week when i am not being lazy and skipping my skincare. it did because me to purge which is to be expected from chemical exfoliants on my first couple of uses, however i began to notice one day that the skin around my mouth was dry and peeling. and this also occurred close to the waterline of my bottom lashes. there was no burning, just the normal tingling sensation but i would notice that the tingling sensation would continue throughout the day, sporadically, on small random places on my face, hours after i have applied the product. another con would have to be the feeling it leaves on my face. it does not really absorb all the way and my face feels a little tight or dry?, i do not know if this is partially due to the residue, people have mentioned, but every time i move my face i can just feel it.i cannot really say if i would recommend this or not because everybodys skin is different, so i will just say buy the mini first, do not commit to a full size like i did.",negative
was not hydrating enough for me. i am with combo skin and just needed more. this is light enough for daily use though i will say that!,neutral

"i began using this product almost months ago and i cannot say that i have seen a huge significant change in my skin but i think that another month or so would really be telling as to if this truly works as it says it will. i do like that it has left my skin feeling hydrated, i have very dry skin in the winter and i have not had to do the intense moisturizing i normally have to... but it does leave the skin feeling very sticky as others have mentioned. this both is and is not a big deal because when i use it at night it is not really a problem because i am going straight to bed... but during the day is a whole different story. it continues to feel sticky even when i apply moisturizer over it and i have to wait a long time before i apply my makeup which is kind of inconvenient. i will say i have noticed i have not had too much acne popping up on my chin and jawline as i had a few months ago i guess i will know if it comes back when i run our unfortunately the price tag is a bit high for me to say if i will purchase when i am done with this bottle based on the results i have seen thus far. not saying i would not recommend, but also not adding it to my list of must buys either. not yet at least.",neutral

"received this product as a sample, and i am glad i had the option to test it. i found the scent to be a bit chemically not super strong, but would likely affect those with sensitive skin. it took too long to absorb into my skin for a gel, and left my skin feeling sticky for awhile. not for me- will not be buying the full size.",negative

"i was interested in this toner since i heard it was alcohol free and it is a new launch. unfortunately it has glycolic acid in it, and that is too much for my skin. it turned my cheeks red, so i cannot continue to keep using it. the ingredients list looks clean, so i wish they would get rid of that ingredient. i received this gifted by rose inc.",neutral
"i was not at all impressed with this. i had been using it for almost months every other night and my skin was breaking out more. i looked up the ingredients not the smartest move looking them up after i would been using the product instead of before buying it, and the first ingredient is an alcohol that is regarded as bad by most of the skincare community. bad alcohols can be very irritating and worsen acne. i was thankful to figure out why i would been breaking out more but still annoyed.",negative

"i will start by saying that i hate roll on products. if you have any bacteria left over on your skin it is just going to go right back into that tube and then come right back onto your skin next time you use it. also, there is an issue with how much comes out. if you roll it evenly all over your face there is not enough oil and you end up pulling your skin to try to spread it around. but if you keep going you get too much oil and then it never settled in. i have never really cared for milk products and this is just another in a long line of disappointments for me.",negative

this does not break down makeup very well and leaves a thick film on the skin. for a cheap effective cleanser the ordinary squalene cleanser is far superior.,negative
i am glad i only bought the mini version. i broke out after using it and it is very drying.,negative

this is one of the best products for the price from the ordinary range. it has made my skin so much more softer. waking up nowadays to skin that has visibly changed. this along with niacin-amide and buffet completes my skin care for the am. on a recent trip my friends asked me for my skin care routine. that is how much my skin has changed for the good!,positive
"i know you are suppose to give skin products at least a month but i used it days and both days i kept on getting pimples not purging, pimples. i tried it alone one night and as a st cleanse the next night because i thought i had used product wrong and both times i broke out. i know it was this product because it is the only new thing i added to my skin routine. it helped with dry patches made my skin soft. but i was not willing to try it longer because my skin is just recovering frombad acne and i did not want to take a chance. i have sensitive combo acne prone skin.",neutral
"just ok. i have been using it for over months and do not see any difference. it is moisturizing, but that is about it. it more just sits on my skin and does not soak in well. i also find it kind of sticky since it does not soak in. way too expensive for the size. after seeing all the good reviews, i had high hopes, but unfortunately i would not repurchase.",neutral

i have been using this product in the am and pm on my forehead lines after cleansing and before heavier treatments and moisturizers. i think there might be a very small improvement but i am not entirely certain. it might be one of those products it takes a long time to see results or maybe it is not the botox in a bottle that it claims to be. but for the price it is worth a shot! the product is very watery so it takes a little bit of getting used to. i find tilting my head up and adding the drops directly to my face and then massaging it in is the best technique. i suppose it is worth a try but definitely it is going to take some time and patience before seeing results.,neutral
"i used the entire bottle and have seen no improvement, however i have read some reviews saying it takes more than one bottle before you start seeing results so i am going to try that. it is very hydrating and budget-friendly so i do not mind repurchasing. also the texture is nice and smoothing. but! make sure you allow plenty of time for it to dry before applying anything over it because it will pill",neutral
not as good as the one it replaced-- on the hunt for a new gel moisturizer.,neutral
this is one of my new favorite spf products! i received this from influenster in the mail a few weeks ago. i have been using this every chance i get! the cream is very hydrating and light weight on my skin. and knowing it has a high spf makes me feel confident that my skin is protected. i always use an spf every-time i go outside no matter how sunny or cloudy it is. i put this on my face and neck! i will definitely be repurchasing when this is empty. i have combo skin.,positive
i was not crazy about this cleanser. i thought for the price that it would be amazing but it was not. i have been breaking out and this cleanser is not helping me clear up the acne. i find it weird that you are supposed to use on dry skin and the product runs out pretty quickly if you are following the directions of using two to three pumps each time you use it.,negative
"i was able to try skinlongevity long life herb serum for free from pinchme. i only received a small quarter sized amount of this product to sample so it was not enough to really get a good idea of what kind of results i could get from using this product, i could only get one application from it so that is what my review is based on. the product is kind of runny so when i put it on my fingers it ran all over the place and through my fingers which was messy. the application was nice, it went on smoothly and soaked in well and did not leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. it has a nice light floral and herbal scent which i like. the ingredients are nice high quality natural ingredients which i also like.",neutral

"what is growing in these bottles is the harmless colony called mother, scoby, zoo-biotic mat, etc. it grows in unpasteurized apple cider, acv, and kombucha. i recognized its tangy smell when i opened my new bottle in february, so i decanted one ounce at a time into a smaller bottle, using that til empty, then refilling as needed. the dwindling solution in the oz container stayed clear until mid-july, when i started using the last ounce-ish straight from ytps bottle. summer heat and repeated exposure to air and the normal ambient yeast spores in it spurred previously-imperceptible organisms to multiply and gel-- just like inside a half-full bottle of vinegar stored in a warm place. if my container were still full, i would strain out the kelpy-looking clots through sterilized cheesecloth or muslin, then keep using the product but having so little left, it is not worth my effort.fermented food is good for our insides and skin, so i believe this particular funky-looking liquid is safe-- it is just no longer practical for me. if used unstrained, the kelpy bits are visible on my skin til rinsed awayotherwise-- it is a good product that has not caused any negative effects on my sensitive acne-prone skin.",neutral
if you do not have this product....what are you waiting for!!! this product is super moisturizing. i love the dual purpose of this product and both work together to lock in the moisture especially after a long day of slaying these makeup looks lol. if you do not build yourself up...who is going to do it?? it is so worth the coins...spend it!,positive

"i was fairly excited for this product, unfortunately it was a pretty big let down for me. the smell is great, and i love that it has spf. the biggest down side to this product is that it leaves my face feeling stickytacky after i put it on and throughout the day and by the end of the day my face actually feels gross and i honestly could not go to bed without washing my face first. another down side is that it actually smells like the goopy sunscreen i use on my kid that is like trying to put icing on your body. i have been using this for a month now and i will definitely not be buying it again i just ordered new moisturizer to replace this.",neutral
"i really did not like this product. really really. at all. first, let me say the packaging is beautiful and high quality totally tatcha. it is completely solid, ensuring no sunlight reaches the product. superb. the pump dispenser worked great. however... this is really watery, so if you pump on your finger it runs off you got to pump it in your palm. ok, no problem i prefer a little more gel in my consistency but no big deal. the absolute nos for me was. the finish. this product refused to be anything other than sticky all hours all day all the time. not tacky, mind you sticky. like i put this on before bed my face would glue to my pillowcase sticky. it was truly just an awful feeling like after you sweat a lot and it dries, you just feel dirty. any fuzz or lint would just stick and not come off. and nothing would tame it not moisturizer, nothing.. it just did not do anything but be sticky. i did not notice any difference in texture, discoloration, firmness, nothing. now, i gave it stars because of the high quality packaging and ingredients tatcha is know for. but beyond that- no, tatcha. no.",neutral
"i wish that this product worked for me, it cleaned my makeup off well and felt nice, but it breaks me out badly. i get huge deep disgusting zits that take forever to get rid of after i use this.",negative
"i was so stoked to try this product out, while it does work and removes all of your makeup even waterproof eyelinermascara it made me break out. i am not prone to breakouts but i have dry sensitive skin. i used it a few times and i did double cleanse but kept getting more spots each time. i returned it.",neutral
"i absolutely love this overnight mask. i use it more as a nightly moisturizer very couple of days and it not only moisturizes, but i wake up with really smooth radiant younger looking skin i swear! i got this in a gift set and even though its rather expensive its really worth it! a little goes a long way so that justifies the price! it also spellings mouthwatering.",positive
"i think it really helps my skin! the quality of the product is excellent so i gave it stars, but it is very sticky and drippy so it takes a little longer to apply. if that is something you might not like, i would recommend the marine hyaluronics instead",positive
i am so happy farmacy came out with this moisturizer for dryer skin types. i love the brand but honey drop was never enough for me. honey halo has saved my skin from the harsh dry winter weather. i also love that the scoop is magnetized so it stays put on the lid.,positive
"yes the protini is better, this definetely is not a terrible moisturizer but its not a good night time one or if you are acne prone. it does not dry properly and leaves a bit of an oily sheen on your face. great for primer before makeup as the oil mixes well with foundations especially matte finishes.",neutral
"no one needs to pay this much for a serum, but if you are going to, i might as well tell you how it performs. the formula is good. it absorbs very quickly and does not leave any residue or film on the skin. it does not feel super hydrating, but it does not make my skin feel dry or dehydrated very middle of the road hydration level. this serum did actually make my skin feel very soft and smooth after a few uses, so overall i would recommend it with the caveat that you can find serums that are just as good or better at a lower price. if you want to spend on a serum that will probably get you- uses based on how much i used before finishing my oz bottle, who am i to judge? but if you do not have that much disposable income, you will not be missing out on anything exceptional by not having this serum.",positive
"i like this product quite a bit but taking away two stars because the packaging is awful. while i initially appreciated the pump top for this type of product, it is a pain to twist on and off properly. today, my pump top came off entirely and i wasted product trying to sit it back onto the bottle. i love this product formulation but will not repurchase until the bottle design is changed- it is seriously that annoying.",neutral
"i got this in a mini in my play! box. i loved it. so, i went to my local store and i got a full size. huge mistake. i started noticing random pimples. i have never had acne prone skin. i am getting laser hair removal and super careful with my face as it is very sensitive. i spoke to my dermatologist about this...she read the ingredients...all oils!!! my pores were basically being clogged! it feels great on my skin but has caused so much damage and now i am treating hyperpigmentation and using acne medication to keep any inflammation down as i am still having flare ups. my skin is becoming extremely sensitive...back to what was working before!!!",negative
i used this for two weeks but decided to return it because it just does not work. my previous oil cleanser had no problem removing my mascara but with the sulwhasoo i had to rub and push my lashes into my eyelids to get it to start removing the tiniest bit. it also feels like it leaves a layer on my skin not the nice moisturizing kind even after using my second regular cleanser.,negative
"i love this product so far! i am only years old but i get really dark eye bags and my under eyes are very dry, thus i get fine lines. when i wear makeup, the area flakes and creases. this product is putting an end to that. i wanted to wait and make sure it was really make a difference before i posted a review. it is extremely hydrating and after using it, my makeup and skin look so much better. i am excited to incorporate this into my daily skin care! the skin cream is to die for a well!!!!",positive
this is a great supplement to a healthy diet. i am vegan and normally when you eat a diet focused on fruits and veggies you feel a lot of bloating because of all the good for you fiber. so i needed something with probiotics. this product helps so much. i have a lot less gas thank god and my stomach does not feel like i swallowed a watermelon whole after i eat a big veggie-filled meal. and it is vegan love it and will use it forever!,positive
it is quite good and it is very cooling and gentle on the eyes i would buy it again next time i need more,neutral
best facial mist i have used however the can i got sprayed inconsistently i think it may have gotten a little damaged in shipping but great for a quick moisture boost without smell i even sprayed it on a rash i got from nicotine patches and it soothed it immediately. the downside is it is effects arnt very long lasting being the vast majority of it is water.,neutral
received this product complimentary from summer fridays and absolutely love it! it keeps my skin hydrated and feels so so soft after application. my skin feels very smooth after use and the hydration lasts for hours at a time.,positive
"i purchase this moisturizer with the s.o.s serum on the caudalie website and i am in love. i have severe dry skin and rosacea... and these products help with both. i started seeing a difference after a couple days. also, it does not make me breakout which is great. the scent is also amazing. the consistency is a little thick so it may make your face look extra dewy in the summer with the heat.",positive
"i was disappointed with the patches. i have the cursed s between my brows. i placed two patches in the space where my furrows are, before bed. when i got up to use the bathroom at about, they had shifted and peeled back. i tried a second time, and had the same experience.",negative
"as an already oily-skinned girl, this serum leaves my skin so greasy. i would never be able to use this in the morningbefore putting on makeup, and when i use it in the evening, it just leaves me feeling greasy gross. no matter how much i massage it into my skin, it never completely absorbs. i will switch to the ordinarys other salicylic acid products to see if i have better luck.",neutral
"i wanted to love this, given the awesome reviews i thought it was practically guaranteed. i recently started using retinol and my skin has been dry af. like flaking and tight, and even when i would exfoliated the flakes off my skin still felt like a taut rubber band. i was recommended this in store and i tried it on my hand and loved how it felt. like other reviewers said, this cream is luxurious and melts like butter into your skin. but that is where my story stops, it sunk in my skin but after a week my skin was still tight and would flake even if i eased up off the retinol. for those that it worked i can see why they loved it, it just did not work for me.i would recommend trying it before you buy it. even if sephora has a an awesome return policy, it will just save you time if you ask them for a sample of all the moisturizers you are considering",neutral
"when compared to other facial cleaners such as noxzema, my face does not feel thoroughly clean. it does not get all of the product i usually put on my face off. it is okay that is why i gave it stars. i got to sample it from influenster. i would not buy it myself.",neutral
"i wanted to love this, i love a noticeable tan and have light olive skin, and thought this would be way easier than using mousse and a mitt so i added it to my moisturizer and added a generous helping of drops probably more than i have not noticed a difference at all the next day except for between my fingers that i clearly did not wash off properly... disappointing as it was pricey and just once use is about of the product.",neutral
this sunscreen has a weird smell that i cannot get past. the texture is nice but the smell is a real turn off. it smells like popcorn or cheetos or something.,neutral
