"considering the price... i thought would be a game changer for my rednessdry skin. i was wrong, it did not help my skin at all. it is a better moisturizer than some but clearly it is for very very mild dryness.",negative
"just tried this and it pills like mad. the bottle says serum but it has the consistency of toothpaste, and you can feel it become kind of grainy and abrasive as you spread on your skin.because it does not spread evenly or absorb into the skin, i have a hard time imagining it will be effective as a skin product. i will try it as a pm product and see wether it is brightening or not, but there is no way i am attempting to wear this under make-up!",negative
"my skin is a little oily t zone and dry around my mouth. i can feel tightness and tearing around my mouth after whole night heat. i use this along with luminous deep hydration firming serum. after one week i did not feel any relief to my dry part. i have to apply oil to area around my mouth like i used to do. i kept using these two products, now half way. i do not blame it for not helping my dry part as other products do not help either. but i do not see any difference on my other part of skin. these two products are heavy and sticky especially serum. i can only use it night time because it will make me oily shine if i used daytime. my sister in law in her s cannot even use it at night time which will make her oily shine next day. it does not make me breakout nor allergy. i do not feel the firm power claimed by serum. it does not help any of my skin issues nor exacerbate them. so to me, these two products are totally waste of time and money.",neutral
i got this as a free day sample with a purchase and was excited to try it as i am always looking for amazing skin care. i was able to stretch the sample to go day and night for weeks. however it did nothing ans i found this to be too greasy even for my dry skin. it smells okay and i am not saying it gave no moisture but for for the full size i was hoping for more. i think drug store does just as well. i highly recommend a sample before buying!,negative
"i received this complimentary from glow recipe. i love glow recipe products and look forward to see what they drop next. the dew drops are great! i love that they are multi use, i use this as a highlighter on my cheeks and as a primer. smells just like the watermelon juice moisturizer and sleeping mask. packaging is very nice and a lot of product in bottle.",positive
moisturizes but does not absorb as nicely as other gel moisturizers have for me. somewhat irritated my skinleft a hot feeling to it. not sure if it has to do with the fragrance. but was not great for my sensitive skin,neutral
"i got the chance to use try this product complimentary from supergoop. i like that it is easy to use and travel friendly. i do find that it is greasy and does not apply well over makeup. it tends to break up my concealer due to it being a little oilier. it might be best to use it on your neck, chest or when you are bare faced",neutral
"i have been using this for about weeks and there is slight difference. the serum smells really nice, it is very gentle on the eyes, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. i have also noticed that it plumps the skin and does leave a slight glow. i love that everything is natural, but i think it might be too gentle. the changes are really small and it does nothing for dark circles, but other than that it is fine. this would be great for teens or anyone with younger skin that just wants to give their skin a little pop. i would say if you would like a really big change, you might just want to spring for something else since you are paying this much anyway.",neutral
"it feels light on the skin, not heavy. i have oily skin but never felt it greasy. i did not see much difference in my skin but will continue to use it. works great under moisturizer.",neutral
it felt super oily and so heavy on the skin.,negative
"after using up the entire jar of this product i can confidently say that i enjoy this serum in cream product very much.i really love the way it wears under makeup or mixed with a little foundation during the day time. it feels very light on the skin and does not smear or wear off harshly. i also used it as a night cream and it played nicely with all my usual products. it helps to comfort dry and irritated skin. my skin felt soft and nourished while using it. i did not repurchase yet because i am trying out the dewy skin cream, which i got in my birthday gift and i really like that too. i wish this came in a value size like that one does. many people say they do not like creams to come in jars because it is unsanitary. i lost my scoop basically as soon as i got the product and i never had an issue since while i had it, it was the only thing i wanted to use. it took about weeks to completely use up. during that time i just do not see it getting gross, so i am cool with the packaging. i kind of wish it has the little spoon clip like other tatcha creams because that is cute though.",positive
"it definitely does what it says it does! it evens out my skin tone and reduces redness i have around my nosecheeks. however dry patches occur whenever i wear this, even when i apply a nice moisturizer below it, so it ends up looking flakey. also it can feel a bit greasy until it melts into the skin.",positive
so greasy! i got the deluxe sample in the spf sun kit and have been using daily for days. my face is so greasy after a few hours. i normally have dry skin. i usually use tatcha spf which is holy grail. i will be saving this for beach days only.,neutral
"this is a product that either fits your needs perfectly or is completely useless. i live in arizona and use retin-a so have extra extra dry skin year round. this will work great for me this summer. the facial oils i use during the cooler months create too much slick in the summer heat. i get random spots of flaky dry patches that i typically have to apply lotion to throughout the day, keeping a jar in my car. this stick is a fantastic idea and something i have never even heard of before i saw it. this works almost like vaseline in that it provides a moisturizing protective barrier to tame flaky skin but much more feminine and luxurious application and not nearly as thick. love this idea, very easy applicator.",positive
"i really like that it is lightweight and super moisturizing, but did like it that much better than other similar products at half the price.",neutral
"pros gentle on my somewhat sensitive skin, did not break me out or emphasize my texture like most bha products do, smells lovely, packaging is luxurious, good pricecons underwhelming in terms of results- i used this for several weeks with no change in my pores or skin in generali love this company and their products are amazing, this one just did not do much for me. i will finish the bottle but will not be repurchasing.",neutral
"i am going to only put three stars right now because i just started using the product about two weeks ago but i think its a good alternative to the clinique cleanser when i use the clinique one to get my eye makeup off it kind of leaves me with a blurry eyesight but this product is easy on teethe eyes and good at getting my make up off, i will say that this should be used as a makeup remover or a mask but not as a full cleanser if ones uses this you should probably use a gel or cream cleanser after to remove any residual product that could be left. but overall for the price point it does its job.",neutral
"i have cystic acne which has slowly been getting better with a consistent routinechanges but this product has by far shown the most difference. i only used it once from a sample i got in a previous order and when i woke up the next morning, all of the current breakouts i had shrunk by half and my pores look nonexistent. it also made my acne scars less red and visible! this is definitely my new go to!",positive
are usually use youth to the people serum but wanted to try a less expensive one and this really did not feel good on my skin. i felt so fake to me.,negative
"what i love about paula begouns skincare range is firstly the transparency. an explanation is given for each ingredient so you know exactly what you are putting ontointo your skin. secondly there is ample opportunity to trial the products via a sample size on the website. not to mention a good returns policy. the bha lotion was one of the products that i invested in full size along with a bunch of samples and funnily enough was my least favorite out of everything i ordered. it is not that it broke me out or disagreed with me in any way, it just did not do much for me. even after the first weeks of usage, gradually built up to twice daily applications, my skin still looked exactly the same as before i started using it. pores, blemishes, oiliness, you name it...zero difference! it is unfortunate, as i skipped the option of a sample pack, thinking it would not be enough product to give it a fair try. i was somehow convinced this bottle would be the answer to all my skincare woes not entirely sure what lead me to believe that!. the good it was not harsh on my skin like many bha products can be, and the application was well controlled, never too much or too little. and i have, after months of continued use seen a very slight difference to clogged pores on my nose less gunk when using the weekly nose strip but nowhere near significant enough to warrant a re-purchase. my sephora top must-have list my top must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at sephora. hair loss treatment divine herbal- hair oil. shampoo sephora collection- deep cleaning shampoo. face mask peter thomas roth- pumpkin enzyme mask. pigmentation anti-aging serum divine herbal- facial treatment serum. face scrub sisley- botanical gentle buffing cream. lip balm nuxe- reve de miel lip balm.lip liner sephora collection- rouge gel lip liner",neutral
i so wanted to love this moisturizer! the texture and scent are gorgeous and my skin felt beautiful soft when touched. unfortunately it left my t zone tight and dry so i could not keep using it. hopefully if you have normal or oil skin this will work just fine for you!,neutral
"i have waited to write this review till i finished the entire bottle. i had really high hopes given the price and all the great reviews, but this did nothing for me. my skin was not plumped, it has become very dry and since i stared using this product i have small breakouts in places i have never had before. what a shame.",negative
decent cleanser but does not help with acne. i found it cleaned the skin and got rid of makeup fine enough with the help of a remover but it did not really make a difference with my acne. if you have acne prone skin you might want a stronger cleanser. this would be great for sensitive skin though.,neutral
"for the price, i was expecting more. this product smells decent but it did not do anything magical other than give me more breakouts. i went back to clinique. then decided to give this product another try. i had the same effect as before. not worth purchasing...",negative
this has so much potential. the residue is a challenge. would love to hear from peter thomas roth specialist on application tips.,negative
i hated this. the smell is overwhelming. it is heavily fragranced and smells like verbena kitchen cleaner or bugspray. the texture is too thin for my liking and i felt like i had to use a lot to get all my sunscreen and makeup off. just really unpleasant to use.,negative
"dr. dennis gross alpha beta extra strength daily peel is a skin changer for the better. it is daily routine is easy, and well worth the results. my skin looked and felt renewed. the natural, supple glow that my skin experienced, left me without having to cover up with a foundation. i recommend this at home peel for anyone who loves doing your own spa thing at home.",positive
holy moisturizer! this is hands down my favorite drunk elephant product. the polypeptide moisturizer is the most nourishing moisturizer i have ever used. it absorbed quickly and is flawless under makeup. it is rich enough to use as a deep night time moisturizer too. there is no white cast and my skin feels so refreshed. i absolutely recommend this.,positive
"this product is okay. for my skin relatively neutral, leans dry in the winter using this as my moisturizer had the same effect using a drug store product. definitely will be returning.",negative
makes my skin so soft! great for my first cleanse at the end of the day!,positive
using perfumed products around the eyes does more harm then benefits. i hope i knew this earlier. look to some unscented honey skin care lines from kbeauty at a change of this one will save both your skin and bank.,negative
"so i have given this product stars not because i do not like it, but because i do not notice any difference in the darkness under my eyes. i am so i do not really have an fine lines to erase but i do have years worth of under eye darkness to erase. it provides a lot of moisture and smells amazing, so if you are looking for a product to take care of dryness this is it! however, i feel like the fresh lotus moisturizer yields the same results.",neutral
"i rarely write reviews, but this brand deserves the love. i am big on cbd and have tried dozens of brands and formulations. cbd face products are essential for my sensitive skin- i am less reactive when i use cbd regularly- less redness and inflammation. but this product is by far my favorite. a massive dose of cbd combined with super emollients and a rich texture mean i wake up not only with calmer skin, but also deeply hydrated. it is plumped my skin with all the hyaluronic acids, and my fine lines around eyes and lips have softened. it is true there is a kind of natural glow you get from this cream, which has almost a balm-like consistency. rub a bit between your fingers to warm, then press into the skin. a little goes a long way, so the price feels about right for the quality and the quantity. buy this, you will not regret it. and you are supporting a b corp!",positive
my skin has never been softer or more clear. after a few days of using this stuff my skin has cleared up and gotten brighter and softer. it works wonders for me. i put a couple drops on in the morning and i put some more on at night right before bed. this product has truly revived my skin. now do not wear foundation much anymore since my skin is so nice!!!,positive
"as a few others mentioned, this cleanser left a nice cooling sensation, but it did not help with decreasing breakouts. i have normal to oily in the t-zone skin with an occasional flare-up a few times a year during that time of the month. however, i have been using this for months now and it has caused me pimples in places i do not normally have them so i do not recommend for acne prone skin. as soon as i stopped using, my skin was clear again. it must be the alcohol and limonene ingredients which are two products known to cause acne.",negative
this is my favorite moisturizer! i have very balanced skin when i use this product. i have switched to other brands and noticed how great this particular product is for my skin. it creates a glowing yet matte finish and it keeps my skin feeling normal all day long.,positive
"i received this freeproduct with trywithtopbox and i love the way it feels on my face. i have been using it for two weeks now and i learned to use this in the morning time because when i use it at night i wake up with a greasy feel on my face, i love the smell and love how it feel on my skin and i have seen my dark spots brighten up. it has like a milky light texture and it is not too thick. freeproduct trywithtopbox",positive
"product was gifted in a lab sample size in exchange for my honest review. this is a quick minute peel that includes!! natural acids that exfoliate your skin to smooth and brighten. the texture is very fluffy and includes little berry seeds that are quite gentle in feel but also much finer granules as well which were more coarse than i expected but not quite like st. ives. they claim this is gentle enough to use daily but i would argue that it depends on how sensitive your skin is and how many other actives you are using at once. this is a double exfoliator, and the physical exfoliation part shows up when you are washing this off. again, i think this can be irritating to those with sensitive skin so i would not recommend this for daily use, especially for those with sensitive skin. also the packaging does not serve the active ingredients and this should be in an opaque tube packaging based on texture and what would be ideal given active ingredients.",neutral
"this did nothing for my skin. infact, it made my skin soo dry that i had patches of skin coming off all over my face and my lips. although, i always made aure to wear it under a moisturizer. would have returned it but could not be bothered because it was so cheap. it went to the garbage.",negative
it is a decent serum. probably meant for someone younger than me or a different skin type. i have combo skin so i focused on my cheeks and chin when using this. i am honestly not sure if this did anything different than the spray for me. and the spray is cheaper,neutral
this is a nice cleanser but nothing life changing. it is severely overpriced and does not last very long. i could not justify a repurchase because this cleanser is and it barely last a month. i would recommend if you have the coin to constantly repurchase.,negative
the same as marios drying acne treatment save you are coin and buy that one instead,neutral
"i have been using isle of paradise for years and do not like the smell so i thought i would give this a shot. the smell is good very mild, but my tan is barely even noticeable. i will have to return and go back to isle of paradise.",neutral
"had really high hopes for this spray for reducing redness and adding hydration. i would apply this under my yttp superfood moisturizer but it did not feel as if it added any extra moisture and only would burn my skin for a few seconds. i really like the key ingredients in this product but unfortunately it did not work with my picky skin. i would use only about- pumps at a time to cover my face and neck, so i think although it costs it will last a while.",negative
these did not really do it for me. they are hard to take off and in my opinion do not treat the spots as well as other patches i have tried.,neutral
it is very moisturizing but i cannot get past the smell! it is a very strong fishy scent,negative
"this product did nothing for any sort of bump, waste of money. tea tree oil worked a lot better for me..never again.",negative
"i do not know if it is because i have my mask on all day at work, but with the cream i been getting a bit more black heads. i like the feeling of it but i think right now is not the best time to try something new.",neutral
did nothing for my pores but does give me a nice glow,neutral
i like these glow pads but there are some flaws. the pads are not saturated enough and they are super thin so when i sweep it across my face it bunches up and then i have to unfold it again so it is kind of a hassle but it is still an overall pretty good product for the price.,neutral
"i was disappointed with this product. i typically love fab products, but this one left me feeling a little dry after using it.",negative
"absolutely obsessed with the glow this gives! so perfect for the upcoming summer months. the formula is great, it blends into the skin effortlessly and does not pill with any of the other products in my routine. i will absolutely purchase on my own, i am really fair so i definitely need the lighter shade but i found a way to make it work!",positive
"easiest facial scrub i have ever used! great fine, gritty texture...fun to use!",positive
"i compare this to drunk elephant protini moisturizer, it is okay. it is not bad but i was looking for a nice night moisturizer so i will not be buying this again. i ended up buying fresh lotus youth preserve which i adore.",neutral
not my favourite compared to other ordinary products because of the super water texture. made it hard to use.,neutral
"i cannot get past how thick and sticky this product is! it does not feel nice on the face- i certainly would not try it under makeup!!! it is ok to go to bed, but even then i am not adding any other serums or creams on top of this as it is so thick! it has a nice smell and i like that it is a clean product- why i am giving it stars and not. unfortunately, this will probably be the product that gets shoved to the back of the cupboard.",neutral
this overnight mask is literally so hydrating and leaves your skin so smooth!! redness has definitely gone down from using this!,positive
"i received this product courtesy of influenster. i loved how gorgeous the bottle looked on the outside. it has some weight to it since it is made with glass. however, i was surprised and disappointed to find that reishi mushroom, which was named as a key ingredient, at the bottom of the ingredient list. the application of the serum was fine but i did not not see the improvement after three days of use, which was also advertised.",neutral
"did nothing for my face besides make it feel smooth for a little bit after removal, other than that absolutely no change in anything else.",negative
"so i tried this product at sephora it looked light green, which is the perfect shade to cancel out my redness. however, when i tried to apply it to myself at home, i realized that when rubbed in, this product becomes very yellow. seems like a glorified, extremely expensive moisturizersunscreen with yellow capsules in it that burst as you rub it in?",negative
"average moisturizer, gets the job done and lasts for a while. nothing special though.",neutral
"i have tried this oil both morning and evening and have found that i like it better at night. it is a great oil that leaves my skin feeling super smooth and refreshed. also, the smell is fantastic. i like that it also has vitamin c in it on top of being an oil. i have noticed less acne since starting to use this product as well. i did not like the way it looked with makeup over it personally but that may be due to the fact that i have oily skin to begin with but i would definitely recommend this product. just find what works best for you.",positive
"i did not like the smell, bit pricey for what it does.",neutral
i have been using this eye cream for a few weeks without super noticeable changes. best i can say is that my under eye is less puffy but dark circles still bad and i do not see a difference on fine lines. it is lovely to put on my skin and a little goes a long way. i just wish i saw more dramatic changes. to be fair i think my dark circles are the kind nothing will ever fix.,neutral
i love this product and really wanted to give it stars but if your face gets at all wet like a quick run to the car in the rain and the product gets in your eyes it will burn.,neutral
"i have had my eyes on this products for quite a while and finally decided to buy the smaller version. after only days of use i have seen a great improvement on my skin! hope it only gets better with time! it is worth the price and the funny smell i use olehenriksen to wash my face, witch hazel as a toner and mario badescu as a spot treatment",positive
"i did not like this. i felt like it did just an ok job of removing my makeup, and did not really leave my face feeling clean. and it left my eyes cloudy.",negative
i wanted to love it but no. it made my eyes so dry and i am barely. i would put moisturizer and then lightly tap the oil around my eyes. it did not work and it did not help my eye bags. my dark circles did not change. instead i got so much dryness.,negative
"this moisturizer is absolutely wonderful. it is creamy, absorbs into the skin leaving it feeling so soft. the noni fruit in it is full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that are great for the skin. you will not be disappointed with this product.",positive
i got these in a value kit with other masks. overall underwhelming. the patches slip all over your face and i did not find that it did much for my eyes. would not purchase individually.,neutral
awesome product! this keeps your skin plump and supple.,positive
i do not know what is going on with this product but it did not work for me at all. left my skin really oily which made me breakout. i gave it a few solid chances and then tossed it.,negative
"it is okay, it does it is job. it is better than a lot of drugstore moisturizers, but it is not perfect. it takes a while to fully absorb into my skin and leaves like a pilly texture if i am extra dry and need to go in with an oil. if your skin is not super dry, then this might be fine. i do not have oily skin but i think it might go on a little thick on oily skin. i do not think i will buy this again.",neutral
"nice lightweight cleanser, good for every day use. love that it does not have a scent.",positive
i am giving it stars because i have not seen a difference yet. maybe its my skin or i just need more time. i will continue to use and see what happens but i will keep you guys posted. i received this product as a free sample.,neutral
"i did not find them super effective, and they dry out if you do not use them fast enough. i did not find they broke me out, but i did not find there was even enough product on the pads to create any noticeable change. however, i will also say after this i tried other glycolic acid treatments that ended up breaking me out very badly, so maybe it has something to do with my skins lack of tolerance for glycolic acid, but i have switched to lactic acid and it works much better for me. anyways, in terms of the product i feel like you get what you pay for in comparison to other glycolic acid pads. these maybe are a good introduction for your skin to glycolic acid peel pads, but i would not get the big size and maybe after trying them i would switch to more expensive ones if i found them effective.",neutral
"i had heard so many great reviews about this cleanser that i wanted to try it. after two weeks of use, i started to get big pimples on my forehead that i had never had before. so i stopped using it and three weeks later i can tell my skin is back to its natural state. that just was not the product for me!",neutral
my skin felt smoother after use but if i skipped a day it would look how it did before. do not want to dish out every few months to have a temporary fix.,neutral
i loved how my skin felt right after using this toner and i wanted to love this product so bad but unfortunately this broke me out in tiny bumps on my forehead and chin area where i barely get any pimples. ended up returning it,negative
"as someone with super sensitive skin, i did not enjoy this product. it is super sticky and it actually broke me out. i think it is moisturizing but if you have really sensitive skin i would be careful. kind of want to return it but kind of feel silly for returning so guess i am stuck with it.",neutral
this is ok by itself although very glowy but not great under makeup. i have normal skin but this made me look greasy as the day went on. it broke up the foundation around my nose and chin too.,neutral
it was just ok. i would not repurchase. i the hydration is there but i would not rely on it for exfoliation or tighten my pores. i think it under performed but that is just my experience.,negative
"this moisturizer does not because any pimples for me and there is no weird or potent smell either. this is a good product if you are looking for something simple to moisturize the face with. i think this will be beneficial in the summer as i get more oily because this product does not leave the face looking shinygreasy. overall, i like this product but it could be a bit more hydrating and this is coming from someone who does not have dry skin.",positive
"i received a sample of this and was excited to try, but after one or two days of using i developed small white heads on my forehead and little red bumps on my face. i had not used any other products on my face on this so very likely it was this product. i think it is the added fragrance they add to this oil as fragrance is a common irritant. my other pure face oils like argan oil for a fraction of the price is more effective and has never caused breakouts.",negative
"i was so excited to try this moisturizer- such a high spf and oil control! however, i was really disappointed. i used the moisturizer several times, but every time the thick formula felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin, never soaking in. i do not wear anything after moisturizerspf but just touching my face after using this caused the product to pill.. hours after it should have soaked it! it was the worst sensation, but i think it is too late for me to return it and i really feel like i wasted my money.",negative
"clears blemishes, definitely would but again! the only problem i have is it does get due in months so.... but over spectacular product",positive
was scared that the reviews were misleading and i am so happy to say they are not. this is a game changer. i have oilycombo skin that is sensitive and breaks out and this has calmed my flare ups and smoothed my appearance for makeup. it is now a must have for me.,positive
"do not bother trying this balm, i was so excited to try it but the texture is so thick almost like vaseline that it is impossible to get out of the tube. i always get liquid on my hands at first and then struggle to get any product out. it also smells weird and is impossible to completely wash off on it is own since it is so oily. i gave it two stars because it does get most of my makeup off. will not be repurchasing.",negative
due to the these products being vegan and so much inventory has been left stocked for months due to chain supplies this came out oily it should be creamy. i even tried a different location same problem,negative
"this is the best moisturizer for oily skin!!! make sure you but on you, t-zone last people always go on here first and that can make you a bit more oily. do not listen to any other review!!! this is what you need, please please buy.",positive
"this product is unfortunately not for me!! i have been using the ordinary aha bha chemical peel weekly for the past month and saw significant improvement, but then i added this to my routine and i feel like i took some steps back. it dried out my skin overnight and in the morning i had a few breakouts.",negative
returned purchase unopened after trying the sample for several days. applied a minimum amount dotted around the under eye area and found after trying gently pat it into my under eye area that my skin did not absorb the product and eye area was a little red. just not for my skin!!!,negative
"this is only good for normal or dry skin! will clog your pores because of the oil that goes as a rd ingredient in it. not only because of that of course, but if you have acne and clogged pores avoid any oils and alcohol up to th position",negative
"this was an amazing moisturizer, really thick and hydrating. i love tatchas hadasei- complex and found it helped plump and hydrate my skin. i initially bought this assuming it would work on combination- dry skin however i found it was too heavy at times and made my skin oily. i would recommend this if you have extremely dry or mature skin but maybe not otherwise. i also did not love the inclusion of mica and fragrance in the ingredients list even if it is in trace amounts- but a pretty solid product overall.",neutral
"i got this from the actual website but i am excited sephora carries the brand now!! so when i used this winter was on its way and i needed more moisture in my life. hyaluronic acid is supposed to be really good at helping the skin retain moisture by attracting water to the skin. unfortunately i did not notice a huge difference. i tried using it different ways, changing up when it was used in my skincare routine. everything was just meh. however, i feel like when i mixed it in with a very water moisturizer it helped my skin really soak in the moisture. also, it can be a bit tacky after application. layering my hydrators and moisturizers did not because much of a problem and the feeling mostly went away, but i know some people just do not like the feeling. so i give it because it did not do anything negative, sorta does what it claims, but not in any exceptional way.",neutral
"i like the consistency of the moisturizer a lot and how it smells! it also comes in a nice sleek glass jar that i love. my only concern is that it takes too long to absorb into my skin making me look dewy. so, it is not the best for my morning routine. i recommend using this one only at night.",neutral
"i received a sample of this, and i splurged for the full size. completely worth the money! i love the way this makes my skin look and feel.",positive
"easy application compared to lotions, but because it is a spritz it leaves blotches and streaks. not happy with this, love the sephora spray so much! bring it back!!",negative
really enjoying this product after the first few uses! it is very gentle and does not burn at all so i feel good about putting it on my skin. i also noticed a decrease in rednessinflammation of the scar once the pimple started healing. cannot wait to keep using!,positive
"i have not had a pimple for months because i am on acne medication, but this made me breakout right when i started using it...",negative
this cleanser is so well balanced. i have returned to this after years of trying other cleansers. only now i use it after my hanskin pore cleansing oil pha and its the perfect pairing.,positive
"the first thing i love about this is that it has an extremely minimal scent when first applied, and even after having it on for hours or sleeping it does not end up with horrible tanner smell close to my nose. the gel is refreshing and absorbs almost completely within the first minutes, so i am not worries about rubbing it and getting uneven marks. the colour comes out fine. i think there is a slight orange tinge after the product has been on a while and before it is rinsed off, but when rinsed it looks healthy. i build it up over- days before using it roughly every other day to maintain the colour. price point is great as well.",positive
"this is good...but i prefer the ordinary brand. i am not impressed with this as a resurfacing serum. it does not make my skin any smoother. i wish it did! it smells okay, not great. i am not a fan of how it tingles when you use it. i am not too happy about that. it does not remove any dead skin or cells that i have noticed. i do not like the pump bottle. i find it really annoying to close the pump if i need to travel with it.",neutral
"this product was too heavy for my oily skin, but i did notice it did even out my skin tone and my under eye area was less puffy. it just caused me to break out too.",neutral
"great product, easy to use and no mess. i could see a noticeable difference in about weeks.",positive
lightweight but does not really feel super hydrating- there are other better lightweight oil-free moisturizers that deliver much more of an impact. every time i have worn this i have felt like i need another layer over top of a different product to actually hydrate my skin.,neutral
"i do not normally write reviews before i used the product for at least a couple of weeks, but this- omg! the first night i put it on before bed, and then of course the side i sleep on wiped off before it got to fully absorb- in the morning i could see a dramatic difference between the side that wiped off and the side that did not! fewer small lines, more supple looking skin. after the second night i made sure to let it absorb before going to bed, the deeper lines smoothed out, after the third night my raccoon dark circles are less noticeable. the hydration is insane, this cream is going to become my staple for photoshoot prep. i have not had another eye cream with such fast and noticeable results!",positive
"i cannot express how much i love this toner. i have hormonal cystic acne and never has it cleared up as much as when i have been using this toner. i find that the combination of aha, bha, and azelaic acid is very effective for my oily, acne-prone skin. my skin has also been softer and is definitely more bright. i love ren and they did it again- get this toner!",positive
"i loved this roller, until it started to fall apart. several times when i was in the middle of using it, the jade part fell off the roller and i proceeded to scratch my face with the metal part. luckily, i never broke skin. fine, i thought, i will just put it back on and live with this.then, one day the metal part broke, so now the whole large roller end no longer works. i do not think i can glue it back together because it was flimsy to begin with. i can still use the small roller side, but it is not as good as the big side for the whole face. this was a gift and it is well beyond the return window, so unfortunately it is a loss. bummer.",negative

i usually put it on my nose.it may help for the bumps but it did nothing for sebaceous filaments or blackheads,neutral

"this just did not work for me. i used almost the whole bottle because i just kept telling myself it just needs one more week. i would use as part of my skincare routine every time i washed my face, so- times a day. the only difference i noticed was that my skin was more moisturized. my skin texture was the same and my skin was not evened out. i saw better results with my face oils. three stars for making my skin feel super moisturized.",neutral
"as a licensed professional this is one of my favorite treatments for acne. for other reviewers saying it is oily, yes...that is because it is an oil. if you apply too much it will leave a little bit of a thick layer on the skin. however i take a clean skin club towel and just pat my face if i accidentally apply too much. the smell can be a little overwhelming for some individuals as it does contain a very off smell. but that smell does dissipate rather quickly once it has been applied. this product is one of my true holy grails and my clients with acne prone skin absolutely adore this product and it has significantly helped reduce their breakouts. i will say that although it claims to help with blackheads, it does not. however that being said no product on this earth will help with blackheads. and if you are referring to those blackheads on your nose, they are not blackheads, they are sebaceous filaments which no product can help with either. this product is excellent for balancing proper oil regulation which makes it excellent for all skin types whether you are dry, normal, combination or oily as well as reducing acne and breakouts. but that is the extent of the results of which you should expect to see.",positive
"i like the coverage and color of this product. however, it really did nothing at all for my oily skin. in fact, my skin got more oily more quickly using this than with my typical foundation lancome. from this aspect, it was disappointing and i will not buy it again.",neutral

"i will start with the caveat that i do not really suffer from darkness around my eyes, but do occasionally get a bit puffy after sleep deprivation. this does provide some relief. i pat with fingers for a mini-massage when applying under eyes, and over crows just in case--",positive
in love! this has significantly reduced the blackheads on my nose and has shrunk my pores!,positive
"i used this product for about a month sadly i just did not see any of the anti aging benefits that it is claimed. i have combo skin since it is winter my skin is on the drier side. this actually made my skin drier. it has no moisturizing benefits at all so i ended up applying this, waiting a bit then applying moisturizer right over top. the serum also has a bunch of floral citrus oils in it which can be irritating drying to peoples skin. i loved the ginzing eye cream i got from them but this one is a pass for me.",negative
"this truly does seem to make a difference with dark circles. the texture is great- very smooth, not greasy feeling, and light. i was worried about my sensitive watery eyes being impacted and i have had no issues. i will definitely purchase again.",positive
"so impressed. the silk peony eye cream is instantly hydrating and smooths fine lines effectively. living in a dry climate like utah, i need something that moisturizes well and this delivers. i have tried other tatcha products and this is definitely on par with the dewy skin cream. i also have sensitive skin and this product did not because a reaction. works great as a primer under makeup and i love the silky consistency. it is a luxury product that actually delivers.",positive
this is my new fave cleanser. super moisturizing and smells good. love that it foams,positive
"did not like this serum. the texture is super thick and sticky and my face did not feel moisture after applying. but as for its price, i would say it is ok for body use but not for face.",negative
i was not a fan of this oil. i felt like it just stayed on my skin and never really absorbed. giving two stars because it did not burn or because redness on my sensitive skin.,negative

"first impression it is very good i love the idea of iterating a current bestseller to make it even better. i love that they found a way to make this product even more innovative. it looks exactly like the old one just with more enhanced ingredients. i will say the scent is a little bit funky it is mild but it almost was a bit plastic-like. it went on smooth, it felt refreshing dried down without feeling sticky. i have super sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all. i will say i think i still like the strawberry serum better- i think it works faster for me, however this is a great addition to my routine and i think that people are going to really like this.",positive
"i received this complimentary and was excited to give it a try. i love the flip cap in addition to the pop off cap to make sure there is no spillage. the product made my skin feel mildly irritated on use, but this was alleviated with follow up of a serummoisturizer. i did not experience any residual redness or irritation afterwards, and with continued use the texture of my skin is overall improved.",positive
"i really enjoy this gentle everyday toner. prior to this i only owned a stronger toner moon juice acid potion aha bha which i use about once per week. so it is nice to have something gentler for everyday use. i use this right after cleansing and it gives me such a refreshing and clean feel and my face definitely feels smoother and bumps are less noticeablesmaller in the morning. there is a sticky residue left when i apply with my hands which is the reason i took off a star. i have noticed it is slightly less sticky when using a cotton round instead, after waiting like full minutes to dry down. i also feel the price point is too high for this gentle of a toner, i would rather use that money or pay a bit more for a stronger formula. if you are looking for a gentle exfoliant new to exfolianta this is a win. but if you are a seasoned i would say pass.",neutral
"i cannot say that i love the way this caudalie vinoclean moisturizing toner with rose water smells, but i honestly love everything else about it! this toner feels so refreshing and my face is always left hydrated and smooth feeling! it also leaves my face super clean by removing any extra dirt, oil or makeup that my cleanser left behind. as i mentioned, the scent is not my favorite, but it is not so strong or bothersome that i would not use it. freeproduct trywithtopbox",positive
this is literally nothing more than fancy stinky water that does nothing for my skin and i regret having spent over for it. thankfully sephora has an incredible return policy and i was able to get my money back!,negative

"sunscreen is okay, i like the concept of a primerspf but it does feel like a layer on top of my face and i cannot imagine the tint is universal for everyone since it does not blend in all the way? the packaging is what really gets me- the orifice is super small and there are a ton of air bubbles in the formula so the product spits out a lot, i have to hold it away from me. i am also near the the end of the tube and need to crumple it to get product out, but there is kind of a significant amount leftover that it is been like this for weeks now. honestly, the entire experience was annoying enough that i will not buy it again.",neutral
i have given this cream so many tries. every time i use this cream i would flake. it is not hydrating at all.,negative
"i was a little nervous at first because it was a oil cleanser and my face is oily in spots. however, i will not be using another kind of cleanser. it is truly one step. it takes off all my makeup in one go, my eyes do not burn, my vision is not blurry, and afterwards my face is so darn soft! it is a bit pricy but a little goes a long ways!",positive
"it is....fine. can you find something better cheaper? yes. i cannot use it during the day because it does not perform well under makeup. using it at night definitely works better. despite this moisturizer feeling light it is very thick heavy on the skin it sits on top. to sum it up, this product is overpriced underwhelming. i only had a deluxe sample so i cannot speak to long term effects but i see nothing that makes this moisturizer special. to sum it up, this product is overpriced underwhelming",negative
"this was very moisturizing, it got rid of my flaky cheeks after just one use. however, it never sinks into my skin, and i cannot have something that sits on the surface of my skin because i wear glasses. i also noticed several new bumps after only uses not exactly acne, just incredibly clogged poresskin. it felt like my skin could not breathe. hopefully i will like the water cream better.",negative

"i received this product free in exchange for my review. as soon as i opened the box i was impressed with the packaging! it looks feels very high end. i used the oil on my face after my shower noticed my skin felt very moisturized looked smooth. the oil does however have a very strong floral scent that put me off, and i typically use scented products. i would not purchase again due to the scent.",neutral

"i really, really wanted to love this since it has a cult following. especially since of my everyday makeup products are tarte. however, in the skincare department, it is a no for me. it just did not work for my skin at all. it stung on application i use a retinoid daily so my skin is sensitive but not overly. i do not usually react to products and am even able to use chemical exfoliants just fine. this also had an unpleasant smell. not too powerful, but enough to say there is better products out there. sadly will be returning once stores in my area open back up.",negative
not for oily skin. clogs and leaves oily surface. did not remove dark spots. heen using it for a month,negative

"this is the first time i am trying any product from paulas choice. the niacinamide booster is a very concentrated formula. the serum feels a bit intense for my skin. i do not feel any tingle or burning feeling, but it is stronger than what i am used to. to reduce the intensity, i have been using the serum on top of another serum or mixing it in with a moisturizer. it is been working better like that. it has not broken me out. the serum comes in a clear liquidity form. overall, i notice a smoother texture in my skin. the appearance of my pores and the texture of my skin looks and feels smoother. this is not something i would use on a daily basis, maybe more like a treatment and not all over the face and just on concentrated areas. for me personally i prefer products that are not as intense.",neutral

it is okay. you get a lot of product but it is just okay.,neutral
this was not really worth the price to be honest. it was sticky and it did not really hydrate much. i will not buy again.,neutral

"it works fine with breaking up sunscreens and face make up, but it is not as effective with waterproof eye makeup like mascara. it takes quite a while to break that up, and it does sensitize my eyes after. when it used it a couple times, i had the formula separate on me came out half oil half balm, but it still worked it was just odd. i am not sure if other people noticed the little oat kernels in the formula, but that stuff got in my eye and it was definitely really uncomfortable. overall, it does the job at a low price, so i cannot get too mad at it.",neutral

"truth be told i have used self tanning products for probably years now and have truly tried so many brands. when i first seen this product i was very interested with it as it is not like the other tanning products i have seen. let us start with the pros. i do feel it is not a drying tanner as it is an oil, which is fabulous. i also really enjoy the color on myself personally, slightly orange toned but i am naturally so very fair that i likely should have gotten light medium versus the darker version. for the cons.. sadly, the smell was just not for me. in fact, even my six year old and husband both commented on separate occasions which is totally not normal as i have been self tanning weekly for a long time. i love the clear concept, but need a color guide. due to the lack of color guide and the fast speed of the oil coming out.. i officially look like a zebra. i mean, zebras are cute and i am not even angry but it is also march and i can keep most of that hidden because it is rather rough. i likely will not repurchase unless another version with a color guide comes out so i can see where i am putting it and in my opinion for the price the cons outweigh the pros. however, i will continue to use this, until it is gone. if i can master the application i used to do this professionally it could maybe be a star product! definitely one of those lovehate relationships! super amazing concept, with some flaw but nothings perfect afterall!",neutral
this c.e.o vc serum was gifted by sunday riley. i have been keeping using this serum during my morning routine for about two weeks and i personally love the product a lot. it absorbs quick without leaving oiliness. i can see that my face is becoming brighter and it helps out improve my dark circle under my eyes as well.,positive
"it smells really nice- citrusy and clean- which made it enjoyable to apply. it is oily because of the coconut oil? but absorbs into the skin quickly. i used the whole bottle over the course of almost three months so considering the price, the product is worth it. but i will not buy again because i did not see any signs of improvement. the ingredient list is really promising but my skin did not become any smoother or more energized looking. it did not make my skin any worse either, though!",neutral
thick like paste after several uses- even with a spatula! does not absorb into skin.,negative
i would recommend to anyone with oily skin. not only does it help manage oil but it helps with any blemishes along the hair and jaw line. also leaves the skin with a nice glow!,positive
not worth it. did not make a significant difference.,neutral
"nice that i can mixed myself and have a fresh formula, it was easy to mix and applying it for the first time my skin looked very bright i cannot wait to keep using this long term and get results. the smell is not bad and it does not make me break out that is a plus... i am already a fan of drunk elephant and really recommend this product!!!",positive
"i believe i was one of the unlucky gals who broke out do to this toner. i have been using it every day, twice a day for about months now, and i have had a steady set of pimples all over. more recently, it is been burning my face to put on. i just stopped a few products that i suspected was causing my breakouts and this happened to be the one. love the rose scent and how refreshing it is, but i did not notice anything really hydrating about it.",neutral
"not a fan, i have been wanting to try supergoop for awhile because i heard great things about it so i waited until my image skincare spf ran out to order it. returned it within a couple days and placed a new order for the same spf moisturizer i had just ran out of. this might be a good product for someone with dry skin or someone that only uses a pea size amount of spf product- which nobody should be doing. i have sensitive combination skin and i did not like the glow it gives, a little too shimmery for me. did not really work that well as a makeup primer for me either but it did not break me out so that is a pro.. but you do not get much product for the price point either- con. i will be sticking to my regular image skincare products for my spf needs",neutral
"i received the estee lauder revitalizing supreme youth power creme moisturizer sample from influenster. i enjoy this product. it was a nice moisturizer. it worked really well. i will say that the only reason i am not getting the product again is the price. it is extremely expensive, even the travel container. it is not in my price range. i will say if you have a sensitive nose, this product does have a fragrance to it. the fragrance did not bother me, but i could smell it slightly.",neutral

"i still have the old version of the gel cream, i love it and have been using it for years. i got a sample of this new version from sephora and tried it for days, it is heavier than old version. it makes my forehead very oily when i wake up in the morning. it takes longer time to absorb into my skin and also a little sticky. overall it is a better idea to change the fabulous gel cream to this cool gel cream! i wish la mer could bring back the old one. not going to purchase this cool gel cream!",negative
"i wanted to love this, i really did. i love fresh as a brand and am a huge fan of the eye cream and the vitamin c serum i use from the brand. this product though...hello cystic acne! i am not someone who has ever struggled with acne in any way, but since i started using this cream i have developed the worst cystic acne on my chin and jawline. i thought, at first, i was dealing with the standard purge that happens when you switch it up sometimes, but this has just ended up absolutely destroying my complexion. i gave stars because it did well under makeup, but good lord is my skin wrecked now after using it for a few months. it is going to be a long road to fix this mess",negative

"i used this moisturizer for years and it was my saving grace for my dry, sensitive skin!! they recently changed their formula for whatever reason the darker pink packaging was the formula i used and loved, and now the product does not treat my skin the same. i find not only does it not hydrate well, but it also leaves little dried pieces of moisturizer that flake off of my face. the old version of this product was thick and hydrating, but the new formula is quite watery in my opinion. i am incredible disappointed, and now am searching for a new go-to daily moisturizer.",negative

you know i was skeptical about this sunscreen. i promise you sunscreen makes me break out. i bought this about a year ago and noticed i would break out when wearing it but then opted to try it again this summer. i wear it without any make up or i put on make up then put it on and then touch up to cover the sunscreen.... without make up it can leave a glows finish but on make up it will ruin it a little bit and you have to fix it so you do not look like a ghost... moral of the story it makes me break out still but i think my skin has adjusted so it does not because the worst break outs i just had to kind of push through. it does the job,positive
"i tried this by way of a sample and i am impressed!! matter of fact i am buying a full size one now! i found it to be a matt finish, not oily or shiny in the least and the fragrance is light not cloying. if you are older, as i am, i think you will be very pleased with the results!!",positive

"first of all, i did not like the packaging of this product at all. second, i hated the smell!!! it is definitely not for me....",negative
"first of all, i love farmacy products in general so i was super excited to try this new retinol serum! retinol is a must in my routine and i am absolutely in love with this one! not only is it not irritating at all, after a few weeks of use i am already seeing improvements with my skins elasticity, brightness and some recent post breakout marks have faded! i love the texture of this and would definitely recommend it! gifted by farmacy beauty. opinions my own!",positive
this serum has saved my winter skin. superfood cleanser cactus oasis serum adaptogen moisture cream is my morning routine dream team. the oasis serum locks in moisture instantly and keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day. recommend!,positive
"love this! usually my dry skin cannot handle gel cleansers, but this leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. it lathers into a rich, creamy foam that my dry skin loves!",positive
i bought this big bottle after falling in love with the glow recipe moisturizer. but this toner did nothing for me. it did not help my pores or give a glow- nothing. it kind of felt drying and made my skin sticky. smells great though.,negative
"used this months ago, and i am surprised it has such high ratings. i have very dry skin and this did absolutely nothing for me in terms of moisturizing. also, the texture was awful.",neutral
"i am obsessed with this product. i am not sure what people are referring to regarding the scent, unless they recently added a scent because to me the fragrance is not bad at all. i have combo skin, break out easily, this is the only thing i have purchased from sephora that works and does not make me break out.",positive
"i have combination skin and i am usually pretty dry around my nose and on my cheeks. this stuff does a great job on keeping me not flakey before makeup application, and it smells so dang good!!",positive
"this is a lightweight vitamin ce cream that works well at a great price. i love most products by belif, one of the clean at sephora brands. if you like citronella candles then you will love the way this smells. it is moisturizing and brightening. because i have oily skin it is a little too heavy for me to wear during the day, but perfect for me to wear at night.",positive
"really good product. put it on at the start of a pimple forming and it almost always nips it in the bud. does not absorb very well, so you have to really rub it in.",positive
"mask felt good and skin felt soft right after, but broke me out worse than i have ever experienced. no product has ever broke me out before and at i have broken out worse than i ever did as a teen.",negative
"not sure what the hype is about? it is obviously not your skin that is pilling off lol!. i am someone that tries to be gentle to my skin which is why i choose to use chemical rather than physical exfoliators. however, the way this applies is quite rough on my face. smell is quite strong for a clean product.ultimately my biggest criticism is that after using for a month, i do not notice any difference.",neutral
"i found this just ok. gives a little bit of nice color after one application but most of the color disappears after washing my face at night. i have to apply this pretty much every night to keep my face the color i want, which sucks because this does not break me out and i like the tropical smell. i probably will not repurchase because it is a hassle to have to apply every night",neutral
"i have glycolic acid pads from the brand pixie found at target, and they work better than this. i feel more of a slight tingle with them and i do not feel anything with this. i have gotten to wear i do not even wash it off like recommended. i just use as normal toner and layer products on top of it.",neutral
"this formulation feels so good to put on. it is not heavy of an oil and makes your skin feel nourished! i can wear this during the day with makeup and at night. best oil i have ever tried by far, and the price is not that bad.",positive
"i do not break out from new products and i wanted to really like this one, but it completely made me break out with little red bumps. my skin texture was awful and very sensitive.",negative
i usually use a product like this from m.a.d but i decided to try this because it is basically supposed to be the same thing. it is not. it is not as potent. i guess if i had never used the other one then this one would seem to work but it really does not compare.,negative
"i received this product complimentary from tata harper skincare.the tata harper water lock moisturizer helps to keep my skin feeling moisturized and not dull. i have combination facial skin and with having to wear masks, the area around my mouth gets extra dry. after cleansing my face, i apply the moisturizer. it glides on smoothly on my skin and and absorbs without leaving my skin feeling sticky. another great thing about this product is the packaging. the moisturizer is contained in a capsule that you insert in the jar and top with the pump that will expell the moisturizer when pressing down in it. i thought this was really neat. once all the moisturizer is gone, you just have to remove the capsule and buy a replacement capsule. thus creates less waste since you are not having to buy a whole new jar.",positive
i got this product about months ago and when i first used it i felt the tingle that other reviewers were talking about and it freaked me out because to me it felt more like burning. i immediately washed it off. i decided after all this time to give it another chance and i do not know what happened this time that was different from my first initial use but this time it worked great. the tingling sensation was minimal and lasted for a few seconds and it is sticky to the touch but i did not feel it while laying down on my pillow. i woke up this morning and my skin looks like i went and gotten a facial. i do not know what is going to happen with further use but i am excited already.,positive
"so after watching many youtube videos about this product i was sold! i needed a makeupsunscreen remover for everyday use. used it day with my fenty eaze drop blurring skin tint and it removed it all easily no problem. it was very moisturizing minus the oat beads you can feel if you put it on your dry face. tip wet your face first before applying even if you are using it to remove makeupsunscreen. but i had a huge issue using this for my mineral tinted sunscreen. it took me so long to get it off my face. i had to use an expired balm i had saved in case this one did not work. my expired balm did the job! in like secs it came off. i do not think this balm should be labeled as a makeup remover at all. the fenty eaze drop foundation is very lightweight but if i use anything heavier then that it is a mission to get it off my face with this. it is a no go for heavy makeup, anything waterproof also, and it is horrible at removing mineral sunscreens. i really wanted to love this since it is so reasonable priced and the company has awesome products but this is not one of them.",negative
"really wanted to love this, but definitely does not protect like a typical spf would. i have gotten a sunburn almost every time i wear it, and it leaves my skin a weirdo combination of suuuuper dry in some areas and completely oily in others. i will not re-purchase.",neutral
this did absolutely nothing for my hyperpigmentation from old acne. i used another toner after using this and my skin felt so cleaner. this product literally did nothing for my skin.,negative
"this is a good product and i can see why its rated so highly it leaves your skin looking bright, clean, fresh, feeling silky smooth, and like you just got a facial...but beware if you have very sensitive skin this might not be a product to use daily even though it claims to be a daily exfoliator... it makes my skin flare up everytime i use it and takes a while to calm down but i still like the clean feeling i get from this product, just cannot use it all the time because my skin is super sensitive. overall, its a good product just not great for sensitive skin and also pricy!",neutral
"oh man, i broke out literally moments after putting it on my face, and i never break out from products. it is like it was pulling all the impurities up to my face which i do not want. i saw a lot of great reviews about this but did not do it for me.",negative
"this is a great physical exfoliator! i have super sensitive, acne-prone skin my skin flares up if i use a washcloth, but this cleanser has left my face clean and calm! my breakouts have greatly reduced, and my other skincare products absorb better after using blemish balm!",positive
"bought this on recommendation from a sephora rep. it does the job, keeps my skin from drying out too much, but i do not think it works any better than the bottle of rosehip oil i bought from marshalls. i know i could have returned this, but i am too lazy. i will finish up the bottle, but would not purchase again.",neutral
"innisfree gifted me this product for review.i really wanted to love this toner, but it simply did not work for me. i tried it times, and experienced mild breakouts each time after using it. i am not sure if it is the product itself or if it is not working with my other skincare items. i have combo skin and larger pores, so i was really hoping this would be a good match.i did have my teenage son try it he has oily skin and it is an great match for him. he is not having the same breakout and his skin has cleared up really nicely since starting to use it in his skincare routine.i will most likely repurchase for him, but for me, it just was not a match.",neutral
"good product, feels lovely on the skin and is nice to use as a once in a while mask. but it is in no way physically exfoliating.. which is the reason why i purchased it... the sugar melts almost instantly so there is no scrubbing effect.",negative
"this is a good sunscreen, it does not leave white cast and blends into the skin nicely. it did leave me slightly dry under my nose and cheeks though.",neutral
"love this product. makes my skin look so smooth, plump and glowing. i am quite surprised how this turns orange on some people- i do not get it because it is a cream that blends right into the skin and adjusts to your skin tone- it does not add colour. are you using the same product or is this something you purchased off amazon? it baffles me because it is not supposed to pull orange. i recommend this. i got a sample and purchased the full size right away- it is gorgeous!",positive
"best cleanser ever. it cleared up my skin like no other. it smells good, feels good, and amazing packaging. i am so impressed and so thankful i found this product because it saved my skin. i will never use another cleanser!",positive
"smells terrible. i have had several bottles of this in the past and my newest bottle smells like diarrhea or porta potty. i truly cannot keep it on my face. there must be a bad batch out there but when i went to return this, the one on the shelf also smelled the same.",negative
"i usually experience dryness around my eyes, cheeks smile line. this stuff is amazing! it going on light and does not because a white cast of pilling like similar products. i have sensitive skin, especially around my eye area and this did not make me red irritated or itchy at all! although this is product is on the pricier side, i would absolutely buy again.",positive
returned without giving it enough time to see if it was effective at evening out my skin tone. found the texture a bit too heavy for humid summer days in new england.,negative
"okay, so very reliable- i was purging, had sensitive and irritated skin, and this cleansed without stinging or making anything worse. it is beautiful and smells a little soapy it is light though, but i am kind of over spending so much money on a cleanser when there are comparable and cheaper options out there.",neutral
"it is so oily! it is not like my skin gets a little oily after a while...no. the product itself has the consistency of oil. face is super shiny right upon application. i work at home and do not wear makeup so i am keeping this one to go out on jogs. the vitamin c part i do feel brightens my skin a bit, but will not be buying again.",negative
"i received a sample of this and was so excited to try it. unfortunately the scent was overwhelming. as someone with sensitive skin, this made my hands and face irritated after using it. the scent is long lasting too which for me is not something i enjoyed. my skin did feel pretty clean after using it and it did an alright job of washing the makeup off my face.",neutral
overall you might like this if you have oily skin. it is a very lightweight watery texture. it sinks in quickly with no greasy residue and has a natural finish. i would prefer a bit more moisture for my dry skin. i also have to mention the fragrance....it is pretty strong and it lingers for quite a while. smells like floral perfume almost so it is not subtle.,neutral
"when i first purchased this product, i was obsessed. it is light weight, smooth on the skin and left my skin looking beautiful. however, after month of use, my skin is more dry than ever! i also purchased the caudalie spf moisturizer, too. i use them both religiously morning and night. yet, all in all my skin is reacting a bit funny and is very dry, tight, and some dry patches. sadly, i will not be repurchasing. i would still recommend because it is a wonderful product but not for my skin.",neutral
"i love this face cream, it gives me a gorgeous glow. i use it at night and wake up with beautiful healthy looking skin that glows. is not is a dream?! vitamin c is a must in my skincare, there is no way back once you try it.",positive
this eye cream definitely left a cast around my eyes due to all the shimmer. looked terrible under foundation as well. returned.,negative
there is more fragrance in this than rice derived ferments. burned my eyes i had them closed when washing my face. i did not like how the scent lingered,neutral
"i really wanted to like this product but it was just a total flop. it has the classic tatcha fragrance, but was much more toned down than other tatch products which was a nice change. however, it left my skin feeling so dry and tight, which is rare for my oily leaning normal skin. it also unexpectedly had a grittiness i was not expecting and did not enjoy. i do not plan to repurchase and would not recommend it.",negative
i got this as the free birthday gift. this product is definitely not for everybody. i breakout easily and the oily finish of this moisturizer does not help with my acne. it is also pretty fragranced and honestly does not smell great. the only reason i am giving this stars is because it feels nice and dewy and smooth when putting it on. i prefer the laneige water bank moisture cream or kiehls ultra facial cream instead of the tatcha one for sure!,negative
has not done much for me... i purshased it in attempt to fade blemishes due to old acne scars to puppleish help the color fade but did not do anything for me. have been using it twice a day for a month now.,negative
"i am in love with this product! i received a sample to try, and now i am sure ill be purchasing it soon. it keeps my skin clean but not dry. the scent is light and pleasant. i would recommend it.",positive
"its not a bad night mask but i am not a true fan of it just due to my skin being dry, it did not seem to help much with that but ill continue to use till its gone.",neutral
"super concentrated, a little goes a long way. it feels grainy",neutral
"made me break out!! and i never get pimples or acne and i blamed it on food at first but i truly think it is the cream. i have combo skin, a little more oily and i think this would work better with dry skin. love te feeling just not the results.",negative
"i have been using this product for about a year now, and it is definitely a repeat purchase item in my skincare routine.i use this product at nighttime and daytime right before my moisturizer.it does not pill when i use my sunscreen, and i can definitely tell that my skin is much brighter and radiant when i use it, than when i do not.a little goes a long way with this product, so it is worth it for the price!",positive
"this is a phenomenal oil for fading hyperpigmentation, for example acne scars. it brightens skin and blurs fine lines because it is a natural retinol. however, it is comedogenic meaning it can clog pores and because new acne to appear. i recommend for mature skin that is not prone to acne. i do not recommend for acneic skin or the acne prone because it did break me out. i purchased this item from deciem before sephora carried it.",neutral
"not good or bad, i have not seen any difference in my skin",neutral
i purchased this item because of the great reviews but this cleanser did not work for me. it did not remove my makeup after washes as my usual cleansers would and it does not wash off easily. i will not be repurchasing it is a no for me,negative
"i wanted to love this product as i really enjoyed the ginzing moisturizer but this eye cream is underwhelming. the cap is very hard to remove and when the product dries on the skin, it becomes patchy and flaky.",negative
i love the smell of the product and the fact that it is cruelty free. i have very sensitive skin and this caused it to break out. plus when i used it on my eyes it would make my vision blurry every time i tried using it. this product definitely gets the job done but it just was not for me.,neutral
it dried up almost right away.... i lover every milk product so this was really unfortunate,negative
"it is ok. i have dry acne prone skin and so far i have not been broken out, however, i did notice some irritation in my eyes when i rubbed them while having this moisturizer on my face. it reminds me a lot of the neutrogena gel cream moisturizer that you can get at the drug store. i would not say that this is extremely moisturizing and i feel that if you are looking for that then you should try a cream or something thicker. i do like that it is fragrance free and does not contain coconut like most clean beauty brands put in their moisturizers. overall it is a safe choice. i would recommend pairing a hydrating serum before applying it but that is just me since my skin is always so parched.",neutral
"i bought the whole line of glow recipe products because they were clean and met all of my requirements in skincare. my skin is usually combooily. can get dry at times, but not too much. this cleanser dried my face out so bad. it is extremely tight and not enough banana souffle in the world could replenish what this took away. not to mention i am breaking out terribly. i normally get- pimples a month but i have like in one day! i am always told to wait it out with new products, which i did. but it never got better.",negative
"so far so good. in addition to this i am also using the spray, so i do not know how this product would do on its own. but i have notified a significant difference in my redness and irritation since using for the last three weeks.",positive
"this product was gifted to me, but i was super excited to try it! not a hit for me sadly. it did not make my skin glowy at all maybe if your skin is oily? it also sheers out your foundation wayyy too much if you mix it like it says to. i also did not like it alone or on top of makeup at all. i think their plumping serum may work better for me, will have to try! this did not make my skin glow whatsoever",negative
"i do not love it. i have only used it once and have only had it on for about minutes and i already know i do not like it. my face is red, it kind of hurts, and it feels greasy. not going to wash it off as i do not want to irritate my skin more, but i definitely will not be using it again. i wanted to love it because i love the niacinamide serum, but i will stick with the ole henriksen truth serum for my vit c serum.",negative
this brand is incredible and this serum has become one of my favorites! i love to use it in the morning and evening before applying my moisturizer. my skin feels so much more hydrated and my foundation goes on a lot more flawlessly. gifted by farmacy beauty,positive
"i have never really been a toner person, i always found them too drying but this one has changed my mind! i apply it with my hands, it is not as watery as other toners it is thicker and that is one of the things i love! i have noticed my pores have gotten smaller and my face feels tighter and with a healthy glow! definitely a staple in my skincare routine.",positive
"received a sample of this, i will not be buying it. i cannot get past the turmeric smell.",negative
bought the full size after a trial but beware it can sting when applied too heavily!,neutral
"shani darden skin care retinol reformi was ecstatic to see that i was going to get to try this retinol serum. i received this serum free from influenster for my honest opinion after using. this had been on my wish list at sephora for a while. this is not the first retinol i have used but so far it is the best! i am and can use all the help i can get when it comes to fine lines and brightening my skin. i have been using for-x a week at night for the last months. i have had no issues with using- no irritation. serum is creamy light and absorbs nicely into the skin. sometimes i use a night time moisturizer along with it, but you do not have to. when i wake up my face feels extremely smooth. i have noticed an overall change in the texture of my skin softersmoother, brighterglowing and reduction of fine lines in my forehead and neck area. overall, i am thrilled that i got to try this and will continue to have this as part of my nighttime skincare routine!",positive
"this product is lightweight and absorbs well. it is not sticky which i am pleased about. skin seems radiant and smooth upon application. i have used this about two weeks and while o know this is not truly enough time to see anti-aging results, it seems i am getting bumpy, clogged pores on some parts of my face. i believe if you use this as a makeup primer it would be good because you get that radiant look to your skin. unfortunately was not the best for my skin.",neutral
"for me the drunk elephant products are.either impressive or big disappoinments especially considering the price, and the beste no. jelly cleanser makes it to the second category. the cleanser has an interesting jelly consistency a slightly liquid gel, with some sticky feeling. it barely suds, making a white lather, not actually foaming. the cleansing agents are indeed very gentle, but not actually effective. i just cannot see how this would remove spf, dirt, make-up or oil, for me it only works in the morning or as a secondthird step cleanser. it does not strip my combination skin and does not irritate my eyes. it is easy to rinse.",neutral
"absolute heaven! i have dry skin and i would been noticing more fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth. i tried this on a whim and fell in love. it is rich but light enough to go under makeup makeup does not slide. it smells like a spa, too. i have noticed my skin looks healthier and more hydrated. love this stuff!",positive
i got this a week ago and so far it has done nothing but break me out. i love the clean ingredients and what the company stands for but this product just was not for me unfortunately and i will most likely be returning it.,negative
leaves a white cast.. tried using different ways and still leaves a white cast on your skin,negative
the design of this product is terrible.... nothing sucks when i use the dropper. so i have to try to pour product out onto my palm to use it. maybe mine is just a malfunctioning one however the product feels really nice on your face.. i would try to return but the last time i tried to return something that the sprayer stopped they gave me a terrible time and i was not able to return a product that was over but could not use.,negative
"i love this product! your skin immediately looks luminous afterwards, and i love that it is more gentle than retinol. it does not tell you how much to use, but a little goes a long way. i used too much the first time, and my face and neck got red and itchy.",positive
"okay so this product is seriously amazing. i have tried fresh basic rose toner and a few of their lip balms before, but this serum changes the game! it has such a wonderful rose scent, that is not at all elderly, or too feminine of a smell! in all honestly i think men could even like this scent as well! it is the perfect balance of not too wet and not too dry, and it does not make your skin feel oily at all! and using a moisturizer afterwards like the directions suggest- is definitely the way to go! it changes this oil-infused serum even more than the extremely unique product already is!! i highly recommend trying this out!",positive
yes! my skin is so happy that i use this every morning. i noticed my acne goes away faster normally- days but now- days and there are no scars. definitely going to buy a second bottle when this runs out.,positive
did not do anything for my skin actually and the textures was wierdly sticky,negative
"love a good acne mask for my combination skin. just a heads up that this is only ml, so as someone who uses a generous amount of product, it will probably only end up being uses.",positive
"short-term benefits do not mean longterm results. as soon as i stopped using it daily to save some of the expensive product, it dried my skin out and broke me out-- red flags of cheap ingredients and quick-fix products that create a dependency on their specific products. definitely meets the mediocre standards, but for almost i kind of expected longterm benefits more than short term bandaids to issues with my skin i never had before i used this stuff.",negative
"ohh my!! i fell in love with this product instantly. my skin has been extra dry due to this winter weather, and my water based moisturizers were not cutting it anymore. this product was sent to me, and i typically stay away from thick moisturizers because my skin can get oily from them, but it has not. my skin feels super soft and moisturized when i wake up in the morning, and this product has made my skin feel and look so much better! highly recommend if you are looking for a new moisturizer.",positive
i have been using this product for a couple weeks now and have not noticed a huge difference in my skin. i love the smell! it smells like fresh lemons. it is a little rougher than other exfoliants i have used. i received this product complimentary for an honest review.,neutral

my skin broke out pretty terribly from this product.,negative
"made me breakout after hours-- do not recommend for oily skin, feels like the product clogs pores and just sits on your face",negative
"i am and my mother is. we are both using this product and have not seen any results. both of us do not really appreciate the consistency of the product which is similar to most other serums from this brand sticky, leaves a bit of residue on skin.",negative
this is really nice for dry skin. it does not strip your skin which is great for winter months. i like to use it in the morning the best. i feel like i do not get quite a deep enough cleans for the evening for taking off makeup even though i double cleans.,positive

i am half-way through this and i have not noticed any difference in my skin. especially at the end of each day there are small whiteheads on my forehead. i do not think it absorbs that well and there is a light greasy feel.,neutral
"over the years i have come to accept that nothing will cover my eye redness or veins, i tried this out on a whim and it really worked. i use it every time now.",positive
thus product smells nice and feels nice in the skin. i have not used it enough to see a difference in my pores but it cleanses and removes oils.,neutral
i have been using this for three months now and there has not been any changes. my skin looks the same.,negative
"the actual product works great. it removes all my makeup without stripping my skin. but it is soo runny. ir takes forever to squeeze out thick product, most of the time i get this weird thin liquid. it is irritating but it works well enough. i would not repurchase this though.",neutral
"i wanted to love this moisturizersunscreen so bad but unfortunately i had to return it. at first it feels really amazing going on the skin but honestly within not even minutes my face would look like i rubbed grease all over it. that made me feel so uncomfortable, i could not wait to go home and wash it off my face! i have normal to oily skin, so i do not have super oily skin, but even with that it, it made my skin so oily that by the end of the day i would notice a white head somewhere on my face. so it says it is lightweight and oil free and that it should not clog your pores but it absolutely does and it causes me to break out every single time i use it so i am not really sure why this is marketed towards people who have oilier types but if you have oily skin i would stay far away from this! the only reason why i gave it stars is because it does have niacinamide in it which is great for the skin and i love the idea of the packaging to reduce waste, but honestly that is it that is the only thing i liked about it",negative
"i love the texture of this product, the coverage, and how non-greasy it feels. it is perfect for combining with my other skincare products like borage oil or ascorbic acid from the ordinary and has not broken me out at all. it also really helps my skin not look shiny from oiliness and dehydration!",positive
i have used this product for a whole month and it did nothing for my acne and skin.... i felt like this product made my skin more shiny during the day i have normal skin which usually does not happen.,negative
"these patches are strange. first when i used them, my eyes looked worse after i took the patches off and i left them on a good min too! at that point, i was like ok, immediate return. but imagine my surprise when i accidentally fell asleep wo washing my face and nightly regime woke up the next day to no eye bags!! what witchery is this?! i am so confused. so the jury is still out and i will try one more time before i decide what to do.",neutral

i love this stuff. i am sensitive to chemicals and this one has never irritated my skin. it is light weight and shear and never pills under my foundation or primer. i have tried other cheaper spfs but keep coming back to it. it has hardly any fragrance either which i like.,positive
"not as harsh as some other brands, cleansing, but skin loses some of its softness.",negative
i very sceptical before using the product that it would work. but after using it i received compliments on my skin. it moisturize without feeling greasy. i already recommended to coworkers and friends. would differently buy again.,positive
love the vitamin c serum from summer fridays but this made me break out immediately!,negative
"i love the brand but this product unfortunately did not work for my skin. i heard this oil was lightweight and had many benefits, but it broke me out. i have naturally oily skin and this product just sat on top and did not sink in which caused me to break out. i do not recommend this for my extremely oily girls.",negative
"i bought this because it is been advertised to help maskne and eczema while also being dry and sensitive skin safe. when i sprayed this on my face a little bit got on my lips and burned them. it also made the dry patchesmaskne on my face burn and tingle. i used this right before bed and when i woke up my face was super dry, sensitive and sore. my lips felt like they were sunburned and had little red bumps around them. obviously it did not help my maskne or dry patches at all. this product is overpriced considering it is just salt water and not worth it. this is my second time attempting to post this review",negative
"i have only good things to say about this serum, except its too expensive for my budget. i used the trail size in one of the kits and my skin cleared up so much. but unfortunately i cannot pay to keep up. but if you can afford it, please buy it. it smells good and is light, its overall an amazing product.",positive
"firstly, the product is much bigger than i expected when it came in, so that was a good start. you also get a mini hydration cream which you can mix the retinol with which i love. like others said, do not do what i did and start immediately with a., maybe go lower than work your way up as your skin adjusts. using this product, i became instantly obsessed, it gave me a glow like no other when i would wear makeup or just have my bare face on, which is why i say to be careful, because i instantly blame addicted to this product and rather than applying it xweek i was maybe applying it every other day i ended up getting a glow but my skin felt so tight and dry my neck had a red rashburn in the arms i applied this product, retinol is a very powerful product especially at this concentration, so now i do xweek for a month then work my way up very month depending on my skin.",positive
"i wanted so bad to love this product but every time i used it, i ended up breaking out in the applied areas or just getting sensitive little red bumps all over my face that did not go away for a couple weeks. i tried this product out for a couple weeks too and my face was having such a bad reaction the entire time. i would definitely patch test before trying!!! i have used aha and bha products before but something in this specific product makes my skin react badly. i do really like the applicator though because it is super convenient to pump onto a cotton pad.",negative
i received this frominfluenster. i was excited to try a drunk elephant product. personally i was not impressed. you have to mix the contents yourself. and the serum smells bad.,neutral
it is okay. it adds some hydration but it does not dry fast enough so i cannot really use it during the day. it will not let my sunscreen stick. i have very dry skin by the way.,neutral
i received this from influenster for my review. i absolutely love this serum! the texture is so smooth but still very liquid. it is similar to their solid primer but in a more liquid component. very hydrating and works great under makeup. also smells amazing like all of their products. i would absolutely recommend!,positive
one star.. why? this is the second time in my life i have used a product that creates wrinkles or makes wrinkles noticeable in my face... i put it only were needed my cheeks nose and forehead. did not burn. dried fast. when i washed i saw wrinkles on my cheeks and forehead that i have never seen. a product from origins did this to me once before. i do not recommend. i am only and i want to keep my skin looking young not opposite. i attached a photo. kind of made my skin look funny and have fine lines. i hope this goes away i am scared,negative
uhmm... it literally does nothing for your skin. when i was using this i could not figure out why my toner pad kept coming out dirty despite using a cleansing brush and pre cleansing. when i switched face washes my cotton pad after toner was clean again.,negative
"i wanted to love this because you cannot beat the price point! i have been breaking out so bad since using this, i have stopped a few times and tried again and still breaking out. i have given this a little over a month to see if my face would reacted differently and it will not.",negative
i used these for weeks and noticed my wrinkles were slightly smoothed out temporarily. after a day or so they were back to baseline. note it says on the box they are not effective on deep wrinkles mainly fine lines. maybe they should change the name to peace out fine lines.,neutral
"i have sensitive skin and i keep stubbornly trying retinol and that does not work. i can use this without getting any redness or irritation. it is a tad drying, but the anti-age part works. i suggest using it underneath a moisturizer or serum.",positive
"received as a sample to test. feels nice on my face, however did not notice any difference with my pores.",neutral
"i have been a loyal shopper at sephora for years and have never felt so compelled to write a product review until now. sure, there are fan favorites and product must haves but this sole product has completely changed my beauty regime for the better. the summer fridays mask goes on like a thick, creamy moisturizer and you can literally feel it seeping into your skin as the minutes go by. i started using it primarily overnight and would wake up with baby soft, supple and subtly glowing skin in the morning. but here is where it gets wild.. i use this product as a primer, too! after washing my face i apply a tiny amount to my under eye area where i have the most creasing occur and my concealer goes on so much smoother and has a less cakey end result. i would recommend this to anyone with dull or dehydrated skin, or someone who just wants to give themselves a little tlc!",positive
"broke me out before could show any result.i have oily skin with some dark spots because acne that i would like to treat, so i gave this product a try.i tried to use every night before sleep. in the morning i always use sunscreen.the first night, i used and i felt a little itch but passed after some minutes. the second night i felt a little burn and in the next morning my face was feeling really dry.the rd night my skin was burning and really red. i used and needed to take out after some minutes. i stopped the use and tried to cool it down with some thermal water. on the th day, i broke out. a little different then usual, half allergy and half acne. skin still red and feeling a burn. i did not notice nothing better in my dark spots and scars. but probably because i could not use it for too long.anyway, i am not going to try it again any time soon.",negative
"i love the brand but if you have super sensitive skin you may want to avoid this one. i was using both this and the moisturizer and started to get some really nasty break outs so i stopped using both and let my skin calm down a bit. i did eventually try this face wash again but it made my breakouts even worse. i have very sensitive and more dry skin so if you also have that, i would not recommend but my friend with more normal- dry skin that is not as sensitive loves it.",neutral
"a delightful product! i have notoriously puffy eyes and while this product diminishes the appearance of teeny, fine lines, it did not do much regarding puff. overall it is refreshing and a nice treat that wakes you up and leaves you feeling refreshed on the grouchiest of mornings aka most mornings for me. i would recommend if you have drysensitive skin- my skin reacted fine and it is ridiculously sensitive.",positive
"i tried the smallest size just so i could compare with the farmacy cleansing balm definitely prefer cliniques version it is less greasy, faster, more effective in one tiny application with cotton ball to take off one eye at a time makeup removal! unscented too! i will definitely re-purchase bigger size the smallest size is best at gym, post-workout shower make-up removal for the day",positive
terrible pump on this cleanser. shoots out very aggressively and does not bounce back. it is the little things but it drives me crazy. overall product is just ok.,neutral
"if you have combo skin leaning oily this will work great for you! if you have combo skin leaning dry then this will not be hydrating enough over the winter. it is certainly not a bad product, but i am going to exchange it.",neutral
"i just want to start by saying the product is well produced and is not overwhelming in scent or tackiness in texture. my only issue was it was irritating for my skin, and so had to remove it immediately after putting it on. i had no adverse reaction after. i would still recommend it, just not to those with sensitive skin.",neutral
i have sensitive skin due to eczema and have had a hard time finding the right skincare products. i did not get any flare ups or reactions to this. i have been using it for a few months and it has definitely brightened and evened my skin complexion. love it!,positive
"i really wanted to love this product, based on the cult following. after using the product religiously for months, i guess i expected more than what the product delivered. i do love that it adds a lovely layer of moisture to my routine and the scent is heavenly! relaxing and certainly perfect for bedtime. i did wake up sort of glowing in the moisturized sense, but it did not do much for fine lines or texture. there are plenty of other products that are more effective, but i do like the luxurious, relaxing aspect of it at night. i am on the fence whether i will buy again.",neutral
"i really like this! while i feel i have other serums that really penetrate and transform my skin depending on current skin issues, this one does a really great job of hydrating and getting rid of any texture on daysweeks that i am feeling extra dry. the scent is pretty and clean, nothing bothersome or to blame if a breakout occurs. i noticed when i use this in the morning prior to applying primer, my make up has a healthier more hydrated look as the day goes on. i would say this is definitely worth the try and i love having it on hand to swap around in my beauty routine.",positive
"my favorite weekly staple. always leaves my skin smooth, pores smaller, and feeling cleansed. do not use on any open zits or cuts because it will sting badly. only con is the smell",positive
"so i got this as one of the offers when they had it with purchase. i am glad i did because i might have been lured in by the brand name marketing, sleek packaging, and promises of goodness inside. for those of you who feel like it is worth it to spend your money on this you earned it, you spend it. more power to you.the second star i gave this product is because of the aforementioned sleek packaging and a really nice consistency that sinks into my skin quickly and does indeed hydrate and make my skin feel good. the problem i have is the same as others??! you are literally paying for a brand name and purslane, for whatever that is worth. pls glass skin serum feels the exact same and has the same results with a lower price tag. i feel like i need to ration this serum. i do not want to feel like i need to ration my hyaluronic acid serum- i use that more than anything else and it makes my skin feel good without any risk of tearing it up. this should not be equivalent to gold in the skincare world.",negative
"i bought this as it has non-comedogenic and non-irritating ingredients, and from amazing reviews, but i am not in love. i feel like it does not effectively remove makeup just by massaging the balm in and rinsing it off is there such a product that does this? it definately works better when you use a wash cloth to remove the balm as the first step to a double cleanse. i have done a double cleanse with just my current face wash alone st step wiih a washcloth, nd cleanse without, and it yielded the same results, so this cleansing balm was not necessary. also, sometimes it dried out my face and other times it did not. as for packaging, i like how it came with a spatula and that is about it. i do not really care to judge it as it serves it purpose lol i will finish this product but i will not repurchase this because it is not what i think a cleansing balm should be. i believe a cleansing balm should effectively remove makeup without having to use a washcloth. i do reccomend it for light makeup days, but not for glam days.",positive
absolutely in love! it made my face glisten and look so nice. recommend. go to your nearest sephora and buy right away!!!! it goes great with the watermelon glow pha plus bha toner from glow recipe. i love glow recipe so so so so so so so so so much!!! buy it nowwwwww please,positive
"i used this product for a full month and it did nothing! i have fine lines and textured skin, all of which it is supposed to help. i actually think it made my skin look worse. i have very oily skin and the thick formula seemed to just make me greasy and settled in my lines.",negative
"cleanser does it is job, maybe a little too well. skin feels very dry after use. takes off makeup. not sure if it is the scent but it caused me to constantly breakout. discontinuing use.",neutral
not sure how good this is working i have been using it for a little bit. my skin had purged for a little bit but did not get rid of my acne. makes it look better in the morning nice and fresh,neutral
"the first time i tried this, i applied it to only one under eye so i could really see the difference between the two. i will say that because this is called a plumping eye mask, i was expecting it to have more of a plumping effect. with that being said, i was able to notice a brighter under eye when i used this product. it just helps you to look a little more awake. i will say that this product makes your morning skincare routine significantly longer because you need an extra minutes for this eye mask. if you have the time to spare, this may work for you. i did see some results, but it was not drastic. out of convenience, i still might reach for my eye patches over these. this is quite a pricey product, but you do get quite a generous amount of product for what you are paying.",neutral
"a day and night cream is an unusual concept to me, because while i can understand why it might be simpler to have one cream than can be used both day and night, the reality is i usually prefer something lighter during the day and something richer to hydrate at night while i sleep. this cream is somewhere in between a lightweight gel and a rich cream, and while others have been put off by the fragrance, i do not personally mind it. it does seem relatively moisturizing and sinks into my skin nicely.",neutral
"if you want to look like a bronze statue, go right ahead.....",neutral
turned my skin super red and made it very irritated. super bummed. it is still red the following day. i have sensitive dry skin and my whole t-zone is very angry.,negative
"when i first got this in the mail, i was extremely excited to try this out because i have been trying to find a good cleanser for months now for my ever changing skin type. this cleanser is very gentle and hydrating and washes off easily, however, every time i use it, the next day i will wake up to find small pink bumps scattered all over my face. i have been testing this product for a few weeks now, but my skin has constantly been reacting poorly so i have stopped using it. i think if your skin type is anything other than acne-prone, then this cleanser would be great, but for me unfortunately this was not a good product.",neutral
"like the texture and lack of scent. really really really wanted to love this product, however i found halfway through the day my skin did not feel moisturized anymore. need to apply the product a few times a day. wish it was a bit longer wear, more moisturizing.",neutral
this actually feels like it dries out my face instead of hydrates it. also this is the second product from the ordinary that i have purchased and not liked. good thing they are so cheap otherwise i would have been annoyed.,neutral
"nice product. helps a decent amount with firming. i would say it neutralizes dullness pretty well. i do not love the way it feels or goes on. not a very sensual part of skincare routine, which is something i personally look for. if you like something quick that you almost forget you put on, this is for you.",neutral
it is not bad but it is basically the same as ceraves moisturizer. do not think i will be getting this again!,neutral
"i have super sensitive skin and i have had no reaction with this. smell is very earthy, like laying in the grass as a kid. i think this is the little extra glow i have been noticing, and i am super pleased with this as i head into the big-.",positive
do not really like the smell but it does its job... you could buy a better cleansing oil at this price.,neutral
"takes off my makeup and skincare well without leaving residue or breaking me out. it does not take off waterproof mascara which is annoying and the formula clouds my eyes like crazy. this is a good cleansing balm, but i have tried better for less than half the price.",neutral
"i really loved this eye cream, especially during winter months. it is very hydrating and truly helps improve the appearance of eye makeup. my eye makeup would look smoother and my eyes in general would look younger and more hydrated. the reason i gave it stars is because it unfortunately gave me milia and eventually some small acne on my eyes, so i had to stop using it. i think it was because the product contains myristyl myristate, which is a very comedogenic ingredient.",neutral
love that i can add this to my regular fave moisturizer. also the smell is the least offensive of any tanner i have tried and it goes away within minutes. i will be a long time customer for this.,positive
"i got these tanning drops in a summer essentials kit, but was stunned how great they turned out. i have very fair skin and love to use fake tan but i could not believe how great the light shade turned out. very natural for a non summer look.",positive
"horrible smell, feels oily when you put it on and sticks to your hands, just the feeling is icky. i am trying to find an alternative to the supergoop serum which is magic since it seems like it is been discontinued, but this is not the choice. it does ultimately provide a nice base layer once you get over the strange texture and gross smell, but it is just not worth it.",negative
"i do love the tatcha brand, it is beautiful but at the end of the day, you can get the same results using the ordinary brand which is significantly cheaper and just as effective.",neutral
"gifted by dermalogica great cleanser. i love it, is a bit pricey but completely worth it! treat yourself it is great! it would be great for college students and really any age range, i recommend!! it is awesome!",positive
"considering this is hyaluronic acid, i expected my face to moisturized for days. it was not. this moisturizer reminds me of the neutrogena hydro boost, but much more expensive, and less hydrating. it is a decent product, but nothing to write home about, and definitely not something i will be purchasing again.",neutral
product is overall good. i enjoy the formula and saw my skin started to have a small glow after- weeks. however i find the price point high for the amount of product you get i used this up in months and i there are definitely products better at a cheaper price point.,neutral
"i absolutely hate the texture of this! it feels like i am putting on a primer, my eyes are super dry after applying it. i am not really sure if it is working i have not noticed a significant change in my dark circles. i have been using it morning and evening for almost months now.",negative
"if you asked me my favorite moisturizer... i would have said protini. i recommended it to everyone! it is everything you would want in a moisturizer light airy soaks in quickly. however, a few weeks in my whole chin and cheek area was covered in white heads. i stopped using everything and reintroduced and this was the culprit. after research i think it is the coconut alkanes... just a big fyi for everyone. also, poly peptides are great they encourage cell regeneration but also hair growth so my face was always more fuzzy than usual. i did not mind because that meant it was doing what it was supposed to. this just was not a good fit for me.",negative
"it smells really bad, like you are putting a curry on your face. it also made my forehead breakout. i cannot imagine using it regularly.",negative
"i got this at marios masterclass in la, it is basically the tacha dewy skin mist as a cream. it is not revolutionary but it is a very good cream. it is light purple which is nice, and the packaging is very cute. the little spoon on the lid is very cute and nice! use a small amount and as it is very rich try not to put it directly on acne spots.",positive
"i really do not get the craze for this. i found it to really irritate my skin, go quite red and the idea of rubbing it in after it was on was not even a consideration. perhaps it was just my skin type but i found it quite harsh.",negative
"okay i had such high hopes for this cream and got a small size, honestly i do not know how to finish it. it pills way too much. it ruins makeup and skincare no matter how i try to use it. everything comes off because of this moisturizer. would not recommend at all.",negative
"i have been using this every morning before moisturizer for only one week and my super oily nose now stays matte all day. my makeup stays on and does not slip off anymore. i used to have to blot and powder every hour or so but i went hours without any oil visible on my skin, even without an oil control primer. totally recommend to anyone with super oily nose.",positive
"in my opinion this product has been way too over hyped. for the price one pays for it, i would expect my skin to be devoid of all make up once i am done using it. however, there is always some smudges of eyeliner and mascara that get left behind and i have to follow up with a cotton ball and rose water.also, for a cleansing balm this product dries your skin out so much that it is actually worrying my face always feels patchy after using it. let us not even start with some of the alarming ingredients it has. i am gladly going to be sticking to my usual face wash which is about cheaper and much more effective. i think people tend to get excited by the tiny spatula, cute packaging and the idea of adding another step into their cleansing routine thinking it will make it more effective. do not buy into the hype. keep it simple.",negative
"this product is the only change i have made in the past few months in my makeup routine. it has caused me to break out like crazy, jawline, cheeks, chin, forehead. and i never break out, ever! i am so overwhelmed with how this stuff has destroyed my amazing complexion!",negative
i bought this because i have not came across a yttp product that i do not like. so i really wanted to try this. first i did not know it was going to be an actual scrub. i thought it would be more of a chemical peel but i went in open minded. i do not know if its the mix of the abrasive scrub particles and the ingredients but this stuff burnt my skin! my skin is very tough. i do not come across many products my skin cannot handle but this is one of them. ill only use this when my skin gets really bad and flaky. i am very partial to my chemical peel kind of gels so i think ill stick with those. if you like physical scrubs you may like this as long as you do not have sensitive skin.,neutral
"i received this in a play! box and am glad i did not buy the full size. while it did not irritate my face or break me out, it did leave my face feeling dry and taut. i was not expecting that since the yoghurt body cream moisturizes so well. i am not sure i would purchase this due to the drying effect on my already dry skin. i recommend for oily skin.",neutral
"i absolutely hated this product. could not wait to get rid of it after it was finished! the smell is gross, it is way too thick, and there is honestly so many better balms out there for the same price or cheaper! i do not know why people say this is so great i mean it just is not pleasant at all to use this! for reference, i usually use farmacy green clean or banila but thought i would try something new for fun especially since people rave about this! instant regret the moment this went on my hands...do not buy!",negative
"i really disliked the smell of this product. it smelled of bad coconut. it was too strong to have near my noise. it went on smooth and absorbed easily. i would be cautious in recommending this product to my family and friends because of the aroma. if this product did not have the strange smell, i would use it.",negative
this is my second tube! i am obsessed! feels very light on the skin and it smells pretty good.,positive
clears all the gunk out of your skin. every time i use this i also just absolutely glow. i love it,positive
i see absolutely no difference. i do not really have dark circles but i am yrs old so i am trying to avoid any signs of aging. i have used this every nightmorning and it does nothing.,negative
did not work. i felt like the stick was tugging on my under eyes even when it said gentle pat.,negative
"this broke me out horribly. it has coconut oil, which always makes me break out. their blue tansy mask is amazing though.",neutral
"i enjoyed this product so much. not only is it a great massage oil to hydrate your face, which leaves your skin glowing. but i also used this to help with my dry cuticles, as well as split ends which honestly just disappeared when i needed to smooth out my hair most.",positive
i think its a good night time moisturizer but it feels like a primer and peels when i put it on. i regret not returning this!,negative
i am and my skin is starting to get a little loose around my jawline. this has been absolutely amazing! the roller works so well and i noticeably feel my skin tighter than it was before i started using this product three weeks ago. i highly recommend it if you are looking for something to tighten and lift your neck and jaw line.,positive
"i am a big fan of facial oils and just about anything that aids my skin barrier! this oil was pretty good- i liked the ingredients a lot. it did smell a little fishy though, which i did not love. overall, i thought it was okay, but there are other oils out there that i like better.",neutral
"this caudalie moisturizer has been wonderful for my skin. it gives my skin a brighter, more even appearance while making is silky soft and prepped for makeup. i love that it absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling oily. it has a plant based fresh scent that smells very refreshing. the texture is light and creamy. overall, i feel this is a very nice moisturizer and have been using it everyday during my skin care routine.",positive
"this is perfect for when i want a make up free day while still wanting a bit of glow! i was a little worried that this serum was going to make my face look a bit oily, but it gives my face such a natural glow and hydrates! to me i think a little goes a long way, one or one and a half pumps is perfect for me. i love how lightweight this serum is and that it gives off a nice light watermelon scent too.",positive
"i use waterproof mascara whenever i wear mascara because regular does not hold my curl. usually i will use my makeup eraser fabric, but lately i have been realizing that by removing makeup mechanically via friction, you are also tugging at your lashes and skin. so i would been looking for some chemical remover that would meltwash the makeup first. i came across this, and after using it for a few months, i do not love it. it just gets most of the product off. but what is the point if it does not get all of it off? using regular oils and micellar water works better, and much cheaper too. also this product is drying, which i do not feel is appropriate for such a delicate area as the eyes. but then, why would i want to use a separate product for my eyes and my face? luckily i do not wear face makeup, but if i did, then this would be good for face, and not for eyes.and it is kind of expensive for what it is! i like the way it smells though.tldr, not effective on waterproof mascara, drying to eye area, may be more effective as only remove for the rest of the face.",neutral
"does not exfoliate at all, product instantly pills so you have to use a lot.",negative
"this product absorbs into the skin very quickly, and only a drop is needed for the whole face. this makes the product last a long time! it has a very faint vinegar scent, which is not unpleasant and and fades quickly.i have not seen a difference in texture in my skin, though i do feel like i am pampering it!i received this product as a free sample from influenster!",neutral
"this product is moisturizing and will help your eyes feel softer in the morning and less dull. however, my dark under eyes are not brighter at all- there are no brightening agents in this product. and i still have fine lines. i have been using this product every single night for months! if you want just a moisturizer its good.",neutral
"to be honest, this okay. in my experience mario bandescus drying lotion is better and works faster but this more affordable but takes a longer to actually work.",neutral
"i would not recommend this product to anyone. first of all, the applicator is terrible. it does not seem very sanitary to apply with that tip over and over again. also, this products burns your skin. your under eyes are the most sensitive part of the face, do not make the mistake of destroying them with this product.",negative
"does what it is supposed to do as far as making my skin feel hydrated and not dull. i use this after my serum and moisturizer to lock-in the moisture and it does that well. i, however, have not noticed any change in the texture or look of my skin as far as my pores, fine lines, wrinkles, etc. it just helps hydrates as it claims and nothing else. i would not really recommend this product as being a necessary element in your skin care regime but i like it as i have oily skin but after using this for the last months i have noticed that my skin is a little less oily this may be due to it being winter. i will say that this bottle has lasted me a long time. i have had it for three months and use it every night and i still have of the bottle left.",neutral
"got a tiny version of this from the rewards bazaar. it is alright, takes a little bit to absorb but because it takes a little i can massage it in. it was not irritating at all! however my main complaint is that it smells really weird. almost chemically mixed with a burnt tire for some reason",neutral
"i do not know, man. i am still not sure that this is not just olive oil. i liked using it to remove my eye makeup, though.",neutral

"it left a weird residue on my skin, leaving my skin feeling almost sweaty. because of the oils used in the product, i would not recommend this for anyone with oily skin because it will leave your skin feeling even more oily. it did help take my makeup off but there are better, cheaper ways of doing so without this product...",negative
"i tried this several times to give it a chance, but it did nothing for me and left my face red and breaking out each time.",negative
the smell of this is so bad. it is so fragranced and it is not even a good fragrance. it smells like free face wash you would get at a hotel. does not really make your skin feel any different.,negative
"pros it absorbs quickly, is not tacky which i find rare in vitamin c serum, the scent is pretty light. con i so wanted to like this one. unfortunately, after more than a month of trying, i can say that serum only caused me the biggest break out i had in months actually, normally i never have any break out in the summer time so this was a first. it was not a purge i gave it a shot for a long time and since i stopped using it, it also stopped. it also made my face super oily and i did not see any improvement neither the instant glow that vitamin c serum gives you nor the long term fading of acne scars.",negative
"i really wanted to like this,but it irritated my skin!!",negative
"to be honest, this is not horrible even though i am only giving it stars. my skin liked it, my wallet hates it. do not be fooled by the size of the container, there is not much in here! but also do not be fooled by that, as a little bit does go a long way if you warm it up on your hands first because it is thicc and does not spread well at all if you apply it right to your skin in little dots. i did not break out from it, which surprised me since it is so thick. there is virtually no scent thank goodness, but honestly it is just not worth dang near. elf makes a moisturizer that i like more and that is shrug",neutral
"used this right after washing my face and before adding my day or night serums. broke me out horribly. tried for a couple weeks, then forgot to bring it with me when i was on vacation. face finally cleared up and the only difference was not using this mist. i have acne-prone skin so i am not surprised it did not work for me, just wish it did!",negative
"i have been using this product for about a month now. pros i have super sensitive skin and this did not irritate or because me to break out which many other self tans do. cons the serum is on the thicker side and not easily absorbed. it also does not give me enough color. i am pretty tan on my body and was hoping this would help match my pale face, but it did not.",negative
do not buy if you have oily skin!!! this has made my skin even oilier! i cannot go over hours without getting shiny.,negative
"i brought this product awhile ago and am now almost done with it. it is a good product as it does not irritate my sensitive skin and it does leave my skin feeling nice and glowing afterwards. however, the results do not last long and the product is quite pricey. i would rather spend the almost on something else that has more long lasting result and that i would use more often.",neutral
"works okay... the dead skin it rolls into is just the product itself. i think the only exfoliating it does is blood circulation and a light cleanse. the skin feels plump and refreshed after, but not exfoliated like i would like. i have somewhat sensitive skin and it did not irritate me or because me to break out.",neutral
"does not remove well, and i am not even talking about makeup. not worth the price better off spending on garnier",negative

i got a small sample size to try out and i love the texture and the light airy feel and i might consider buying a regular size to try out for longer. it goes on smooth and leaves my skin moisturised and glowing. i normally use peter thomas roth water drench cloud cream or caudalie vinoperfect and i really think that it confidence in a gel lotion compares favourably to my water drench moisturiser.,positive
"i purchased this. it came in my sephora favorites vacay all day set. i like it, but i do not love it. i will use it as a body sunscreen as it is a tad too thick for my face. it feels like it is be a wonderful cream for extremely dry skin, but any other skin type may not be well suited for this formula. it feels like something i want in a hand cream which is something that does not disappear with zero trace of hydration. it really does not absorb and i do not know if that is good or bad. i am just waiting for my skin to react badly because i am wearing it right now and my face feels congested. you really will know you have something on your face once you put your mask on. this would be better suited for winter time usage in my opinion.",neutral
this product was super hydrating and glided around my eyes. problem was i broke out immediately after applying it. i do not plan to use it again.,neutral

"i am a member of the sampling program pinchme and the latest item i have agreed to try and review is dr. dennis gross hyaluronic marine melt away cleanser. let us begin with- it is for all skin types! that is so rare these days!! if your skin changes periodically, kind of like mine does, this is perfect because the cleanser evolves with your skin. some other positive attributes include it soap and sulfate-free, leaves the skin feeling soothed, hydrated and nourished, safe to use around the eye area, oil-free even dissolving waterproof makeup, allergy tested, cruelty-free and so much more! this new age formula goes on very smooth, with a fresh and clean scent making it extremely easy to take with you absolutely anywhere! i have to be honest, this is my first experience ever with any dr. dennis gross product and i am pleasantly surprised... especially when i am amazingly picky about any and every thing i put on my face. my experience with dr. dennis gross hyaluronic marine melt away cleanser was an extremely positive one as i enjoyed every step of the process. plus, it is always nice finding a company that actually does do what it advertises it does! honesty means everything when it comes to the brand! i will definitely buy this cleanser along with other dr. dennis gross items in the near future and i have already begun to spread the word to family, friends and social media about what a fantastic item dr. dennis gross has created. keep up the great work everybody over at dr. dennis gross skincare!",positive
"i have not seen any difference while using this, i do not find it hydrating and i am not sure if it was just the one i bought but even the slightest squeeze and so much unnecessary product came out. i have to squeeze it very very light so only a little bit can come out or it all literally just bursts out. it was very annoying.",negative
"this is a thick, gloopy clear serum that i had purchased directly from the brand website to help with occasional breakouts. unfortunately, since i get hormonal breakouts more than bacterial breakouts, i did not see a change after months of using this product. i also found that if i used this serum too many days in a row, i would find mysterious little red bumps in places i do not usually break out. once i discontinue use, the bumps go away. i also have a slight issue with this product pilling if i do not let it dry completely before applying the rest of my skincare products moisturizer, face oil or if i rub too hard. not a big deal, but does feel unusual. i will probably continue to use once or twice a week to use up the bottle but will not repurchase. i like many of the products from the ordinary but this one just was not for me!",neutral
i bought the travel size version of this. i have not really noticed any difference it is having in my skin but it feels really nice and smells really citrus-y which i like.,positive
this product has a odd buy pleasant smell to it. it is easy to distribute as well. i do not feel like it works at all though. it caused my face to break out and the fine lines were still there after several weeks of use. the price is too high as well.,neutral
if you are allergic to pine do not use. i bought this and did not realize it was make with pine. i returned after one use. i am sure it may work for others. and i absolutely love the ordinary.,negative
"the only pro to this mist is that if you want to tighten your pores after washing your face, it will do the trick, but i do not think the smell and the eye burn is worth it. the almost menthol-y smell is way too overpowering, and it follows you after your spray. i hold my breath and spray my whole face and neck and then try to walk away from the bathroom before inhaling, but the mist lingers in the air around your face like a cloud so you cannot escape breathing in the chokingly overpowering smell of the product. after a bit of coughing, the next problem i notice is that my eyes burn when i open them. i have to be very careful when i spray to avoid my eyes either by holding my hand over them or wearing a sleeping eye mask which is just a nuisance to have to worry about when applying a toner. this product is too expensive and simply not worth the hassle to use. i much prefer regular toners you apply to a cotton pad and dab onto your skin.",negative
dried my skin out and gave me tiny bumps. returned the next day.,negative
"i got this complimentary to test and review from influenster and i am so happy to be able to review this!! i love josie maran products so much but this unfortunately is not working for me. i have been using it for a week now by itself at night i have not worn any makeup for a whole week so i could give this a good review. when you apply it, it is nice on the skin and i noticed it does plump it up and its not to heavy or greasy. i have combo skin and it is taking my dryness from the winter away. however....it is making my skin break out so so bad which really sucks. i have not noticed a difference in my fine lines or wrinkles yet. but i am going to keep using this to see if it does anything with those i just wish it did not break my face out so bad. and like i said i have been using this and only this for past week so i know this product is what is causing the breakouts. i still like it as its the only product that is helping the dryness in my skin.",neutral
"i have used this product for a few weeks now, and i find it to be just ok. it is definitely hydrating but i did not see a noticeable difference in puffiness. i will say for a retinol product, it was definitely very gentle i had no irritation. i received this product for free for testing purposes.",neutral
made no discernible difference to the lines on my forehead.,negative
"i never write reviews but this is a terrible product. it separates in the tube, leaves a film on my skin, gives me blurry vision no matter how much i scrub it off, and does not remove mascara or eyeliner. it also has a gritty texture. i feel like i can make almost anything work or just deal with it until it is gone, but i literally hate using this.",negative
i received this product to try i loved it for the moisture on my face. definitely was good for putting on before my primer. i would definitely buy this.,positive
seems a bit over done some of these reviews like this is a miracle. you get a very decent sized jar for your dollar. the smell is nice. it is a nice moisturizer but it is not working any miracles. just another nice cream with a good smell. i have been using it about a month now and no my lines have not magically poofed out to year old me but i am sure it is helping as any night moisturizer will.,neutral
"almost all sunscreens irritate my face, except this one. i have severely dry skin and it is in the process of recovering. i did not wear sunscreen before because it would be painful and uncomfortable on my face but i knew that i needed to wear it because sun damage is real and can be very serious. so i tried this one because i like a toner from this brand and it was not expensive and it changed my life. this feels nice on my skin, and makes it so sunscreen is something that i actually enjoy putting on. also no white cast! my family and friends with dark skin use this too and never have a problem with a white cast",positive
"i really liked this product and i hate giving it two starts but i must have gotten a bad bottle because i could not get more than a half dozen uses out of it. i did not overuse it either, i am talking like a pea to dime sized amount each night and then it was empty. i would repurchase but i will wait a while for a newer batch and return this one. uses is not right.",negative
"i suffer from eczema and used this mask last night and my skin was clear, not flaky, and felt amazing upon waking up this morning! highly highly recommend, i know i will definitely be repurchasing this myself!",positive
"i like this product, but it has caused me to break out a bit. i typically have very clear skin butive seen a few acne buds sprout up since i have started using it.",neutral
"the only cleansing balm i have found that takes off all my make up, including my mascara! normally i have to use micellar water to remove eye makeup prior to using this product. but this takes it all off without leaving my skin feeling greasy or stripped of moisture after rinsing! definitely my new favorite cleansing balm!",positive
this was recommended in store and definitely misses the mark for me. it is incredibly drying and seems to lead to more breakouts as a result. skip this and go straight to the niacinamide zinc.,negative
"i have been using this for a couple of months now and i have not seen any difference in my oiliness or breakouts. throughout the day, i unfortunately become more oily especially on my forehead and chin after cleansing with this product and using my other prescribed acne medications. once i do not use the cleanser i do not wake up with an oily residue nor does my face become oily. i am just going to switch back to using ren cleansing gel. although, i must say after the shower and then doing my routine it does make my face feel somewhat cleansed when used.",neutral
i gave this stars because while i do think this is helpful for acne. it actually gives me headaches. i think it is the smell of the chemicals. i wanted to really like it though because i think it helps minimize any little bumps i would get. but after using it two times i got a headache. so that sucks. but if you try it and do not get a headache then i think it is great for the occasional acne on your face.,neutral
"barf. after hours the smell of self tanner develops and stinks your body completely. although the oil itself does not smell bad initially, it is deceiving. i used drops w cerave lotion on each area for two days. nothing happened. it made my otherwise normal lotion into a sticky mess that never soaked into my skin. sticky and stinky this product i would not recommend.",negative
"after reading many reviews saying that this sunscreen blends in easily and is not greasy, i felt kind of duped... what i got is very greasy looking and did not just sink in. i also had some pilling after trying to put very minimal makeup over it just light concealer. i will try again and update my review if i have a different experience with different products. i am just disappointed because for oz of sunscreen is not cheap. worst comes to worst, i will just use it on my body only.",negative
so drying wow. after using for a week my entire face started peeling and no amount of moisturizer is helping. in my opinion it feels as harsh on my skin as a hand soap would be.,negative
"i am obsessed with this cleansing balm. i just learned about double cleansing, and this is my first cleansing balm, but i love everything about it. i look forward to washing my face at the end of the day. i have little kids, so this part of my skincare routine just relaxes me and seriously feels like self-care. the scent is so soothing and i love the way the product feels as i massage it into my face. i have oily, acne prone skin and i credit this balm- and double cleansing- for really helping to clear up my skin. i had a lot of congestion on my forehead, and i think i was not getting all of my makeup off at the end of the day. this easily removes all of my eye makeup and sunscreen. and it easily washes off and does not clog my drain. after this, i wash with a gentle cerave cleanser. i just reordered. this stuff is seriously the best.",positive
i do not feel like these worked. i put them on nights in a row on the same blemish and it did not get better,negative
"i really just love everything about this sunscreen. living in the desert and spending a lot of time outdoors means i have to be committed to applying sunscreen of the time and i have found that many irritate my skin, sting or result in my skin feeling somewhat raw by the end of the day. such is not the case with the shiseido ultimate sun protector lotion! the smell does not bother me, it does not sting upon reapplication nor does it clump under my makeup! that last benefit alone is worth the steep price tag i am going to!",positive
"this particular product feels very nice on my skin when cleansing, although it made me completely break out even more than i did before. i have severe acne and i do not know what to do anymore.",negative
"i have sensitive skin with a patch of rosacea on my left cheek. i have struggled to find a moisturizer that will not because dermatitis on my face or burn my rosacea. this stuff is pretty amazing though. it soothed a patch of dermatitis the very first night i put it on. it is been five nights now and the patch is entirely gone, replaced by smooth, soft skin. i know it will not erase the rosacea, apparently nothing will except maybe lasers, but this does not irritate it like other moisturizers usually do. i have finally found something that keeps my skin from flaking without burning or itching. i am impressed.",positive
"i got this product as part of the set i bought. this is the only product i was not pleased with. only good thing about it is the smell. after use, it leaves my skin feeling sticky and oily. it seems as if the product never gets absorbed into the skin. i use it at night time after washing my face as a moisturizer, but even when i wake up, the product seems to be greasy and on my skin rather than absorbed overnight for its benefits. would not recommend. but their vitamin c serum is nice and so is their brightening eye cream which were the other two products in the set!",negative
i love this serum. it smells and feels great on myskin. i like to use it before my moisturizer and it adds an extra layer of moisture. the only down side is the packaging. i just with there was a better dispenser for this product.,positive
"i waited to leave a review until i finished the box, so i could bet certain that this product does not change anything. honestly, worst purchase ever. it is not worthy at all",negative
i am not sure if it helped with my skin discoloration. my skin is sensitive and even mixed with my moisturizer this formula was too strong for me to use daily. i used it daily for about- weeks and my skin became irritated with dry patches. i love the smooth texture and the mattifying effect before makeup application. great product for the price!,neutral
"i have never written a review for a product here at sephora. this going to be the first time. let me tell you this. this by far the best product i have used in my entire life and for sure would keep in my beauty products. i suffer from acne, red marks, and clogged pores. i bought the day sample. after just one use, i already could tell the difference! my face feels so smooth and soft. my red marks lightened up a bit and my face is glowing. what i also like about this is that it does not make my face red compared to retin-a that i was using before this. it was intimidating at first because of the name but you guys should try it!! it is worth the price and i am so in love with this product",positive
"bought this product as we head into the winter months i am in nyc hoping it would help defend my skin from the cold and wind. since i began using this mask, my skin has been so rough with dry skin. i have been exfoliating on a regular basis and using this to help my flaky, dry skin until i finally realized it is this product causing the roughness on my face cheeks and forehead specifically. there must be an ingredient in it that i am sensitive to, although i would not normally put myself in the sensitive skin category.",negative
okay so do you put drops in your whole moisturizer bottle or just every time you use it? mine is coming out patchy looking.,negative
"i really wanted to love this product, the packaging is so beautiful and i have always loved dior skincare. right from the beginning the smell is a bit strong but it does go away. it has a strange liquid to powder like texture so i was not sure how to incorporate it into the rest of my routine. i do not dislike it the product but i cannot say i absolutely love it. i continue to use it just in case i am missing something. so far i have been using it for about weeks and the only thing i can say is that it gives my skin a sort of soft diffused look kind of like a primer. overall i do not dislike it but i would not be able to justify paying so much without more benefit.",neutral
really love this!!! my skin looks more hydrated and feels amazing,positive
i am fairly certain this made me breakout. i have had clear skin for over a year- until i started sampling this cream. i was excited to try this because of the hype...it is all hype. incredibly overpriced for a very basic product. not very cosmetically elegant- it does not smell good and leaves a slightly stickytacky residue that sits on top of the skin. will not be trying or buying this again.,negative
"up until trying this product, i had not found a sunscreen that did not because me to have cystic acne or make me look like a shiny, greasy mess. this sunscreen has a ton of slip to it, feels more like a primer, and causes zero breakouts! i only wish it came with a pump, as it is a little hard to control the amount of product being dispensed. overall, a holy grail type of product!",positive
i tried this at an in-store facial session and fell in love. on the advice of the salesperson i cut each one in half. it really is enough and doubles the usage! i am with oily but dehydrated skin. i use this times a week and my skin is noticeably brighter and healthier looking. worth the price!,positive
these rose gold eye masks really hydrated my eyes. i left them on for about minutes and i could really feel and see the difference. bonus that they are super pretty!,positive
i love the way this feels on my skin. i had absolutely zero irritation and i have been applying it three times week. i have experienced some peeling but absolutely no breakouts since using this!,positive
"i love all dr.dennis gross products, this one, however, starts great but it dries up my skin and i ended using another eye cream on top of this one.",negative
"smells great, but does not work to help the redness from my rosacea. might work for others but sadly does not work for me.",negative
i will never be without this. it is the best at softening my wrinkles and brightening my skin.,positive
do not waste your money. all this did was exaggerate the texture on my face.,negative
waste of money. feels good on the skin but does not have any real results. another disappointment in eye creams,negative
"i purchased this product on a whim and i was skeptical as i have tried so many products and never saw any definitive results. but i am so happy i purchased this product. i am a black woman and my face is covered in years of acne scars, discoloration and hyperpigmentation and after only one month of use i am finally seeing results...real results. this productcompany was never on my radar but this is the real deal and i cannot stop smiling at the results. holy grail!",positive
"i feel like i am a traitor to the skincare cult because as much hype as this product is given, it just did not live up to it for me. i was super exciting about getting a mini size, confident it was going to become a must have for me and result in me forking over for the larger size......well i will not be doing that anytime soon.first, its a powder that you add water to. add too much and you have wasted it so be careful. once tou have the perfect paste, it works to exfoliate your skin. does it work? yes of course. are there products that work just as good if not better for less than half the price? most definitely. there is nothing special about this, not special. and the smell or lack there of maybe is just gross. i know that makes zero sense, but it has a smell to it that reminded me of dirt. if you are looking fot a good exfoliant that is not harsh, i promise you can find the same results at a much cheaper price point.",neutral
"it is a very drying product that clung to dry spots on my face even with combined with moisturizer. it also really washed me out, made me look very pale and i could feel it on my face all day. even foundation does not feel that heavy on my face. it did remove the slight redness i have but i do not know if that is worth it.",neutral
"applying this serum in the morning is problematic, since it is incompatible with other products and makeup. anything you apply over it pills like crazy. i am debating whether it is worth keeping for nighttime application only, but since it is intended for twice-daily use, presumably the benefits would be less. really disappointed.",negative
"worked great for the first few months but lately, i have noticed my skin is too dry despite summer in florida kicking in. i am breaking out not because of oil, but because my skin is too dry. super light weight cream and heaping it on does not change level of hydration. water cream is a great name for this product as it has about zero hydration. i have combination skin.",neutral
"i really wanted to like this makeup remover since i love so many of fabs other products. this was a no for me. i do love the pump and the consistency. although it removed my face makeup just fine, it does not remove my waterproof mascara. i have to double cleanse with this and it is still not removed. i have noticed my eyelashes fall out more when i use this product i am assuming it is because i am more abrasive than normal since it is not easily removing my makeup. i am sure it is fine for non waterproof mascara but i do not recommend for waterproof peeps.",negative
"i have only been using the niacinamide serum for a couple weeks, but so far i am pretty disappointed in it. i have not seen any positive changes in my skin. i have also had new breakouts. i am going to use it for another week to see if there are any improvements but as of now i would not recommend this product.",negative
this is great for the price. i use it nightly and i look well rested. the consistency out of the tube is different- can be creamy or goopy.,positive
"i was super excited when i received my influenster vox box with a drunk elephant product!! this facial mist is everything!! it is perfect for this time of year, it sinks into the skin nicely with out any yucky feeling and you actually feel moisturized. i recommend this facial mist!! thank you influenster for allowing me to test this product out!",positive
"i wanted to love this, i only wash my face at night. i love the scent but made the skin around my nose crack and the skin under my lips and chin peel. i used for weeks and it kept getting worse. within days of stopping the use my skin cleared up, and quit peeling and cracking.",negative
my all time favourite toner. makes my face feel fresh and clean without ever feeling tight. keeps breakouts away and heals them quickly. buy it.,positive
"i would say this is probably a better option in the summer, but i received a sample of this in a sephora sample bat in the wintertime. it is got a bit more pf a gel consistency, but i found it insufficient. it was way too drying on my skin, but otherwise, it did not do any damage.",neutral
"what i love about this product is that i feel like it is basically serums in one. i have been looking for a dark spots serum for a bit now, i get a couple sun spot patches during summer, and have some slight discoloration on my cheeks. plus, it is almost guaranteed that after a zit, there will be some sort of scar surface level or deeper. however, i already use a vit c serum and an aha serum, and i feel like there are just stubborn spots that are not going away. when looking at the ingredients here, i love that it is tranexamic but also blends in a high level of ahas. most, i feel, are tranexamic or ahas and i was definitely interested in the combo of both. i have been easing it to it by using ever other night, and so far i can definitely see an improvement in my skins brightnessradiance and overall texturetone. i have a couple dots that i am monitoring as the true test, but so far, i like this.",positive
"i received the product free for testing purposes. i went into with little expectation for this product and i am glad i did. this scrub is average. i used it twice and did not notice anything extraordinary. while i appreciate the ingredient list, everything else fell flat for me. the scent was too much and i am not sensitive to smells. i believe there are better products out there. fyi, all the white stuff you see is actually the product, not necessarily your dead skin.",neutral
"this product is amazing! i received this product using a free sample program and let me just tell you, it is a fantastic product. i have been using it for a few weeks now and it leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed. it has a very nice, sweet smell that is not too strong or overwhelming. it is a rather large product but a little does go a long way, as it lathers very well and very easily. if you are thinking about purchasing this product, do it!",positive
"like other reviewers stated, these are not drenched in product. i do not think that is actually a major issue. they have enough product to do the job, as i feel most pads are soaked with more product than i can use in a single sitting. these glow peel pads are not harsh, i do not have any major negative reactions to them. that being said, they do not have a strong impact with only-week has either. i have not yet tried daily use, but will update accordingly.",neutral
"it feels amazing on my skin, leave it feeling super hydrated but smells awful i hate the smell of it but love the product! i would definitely recommend though",positive
"i am usually a huge fan of farmacy products but this one missed the mark for me. it is not as moisturizing as i would like it to be. i have to put on multiple layers in order for it to feel like it is actually moisturizing my skin. would be good for someone with oily skin and perhaps in the summer but not the best for dry winters. the tub also is not the most user-friendly. i wish this had a pump or dispenser on it so it was easier to use daily. on the plus side, it has a really lovely fruity smell and is very light on the skin.",neutral
"this product was extremely disappointing. i like the consistency of the cream but that is it. i do not love the unscented scent. i also am blown away by the packaging, the pump did not work there is so much unnecessary plastic and plastic? for this price- disappointing. i ended up returning, could not justify it. sticking to clarins hydra-essentiel cream",negative
these eye gels are amazing. my under eye is more hydrating and not as saggy. these eye gels are easy to put in the fridge and wear cold. not greasy or heavy to wear.,positive
"i absolutely love this cleanser. its definitely in my top three next to tatchas rice cleanser and keihls calendula cleanser. it lathers not too much, it is moisturizing and gives your skin probiotics. also does not make your skin feel tight or dry after using. definitely recommend.",positive
i felt this clog my pores. smells funny. i love most of the ordinary products. i really had high hopes for this but it was disappointing.,negative
"reason i am giving this a star is because of the horrid packaging the product is in. the product is on the thicker end and algenist created a droplet styled bottle?? makes absolutely no sense. i am losing so much product because the dropper simply cannot suck up the product. after spending. on this, i would at least hope to be able to use all of the product. a lot of the liquid collagen is stuck around the edges of the bottle and i cannot reach it. i will definitely not be purchasing this product again.tldr horrid packaging extremely wasteful.",neutral
"very strong smell. moisturizes ok, takes a little long to absorb into my skin. really i just do not like the overwhelming smell.",neutral
"this stuff is so good for dry skin. every winter i deal with tight dry skin, that as of yet has not been remedied by any moisturizer-i have tried them all, from cheap to stuff i had to sell a kidney for. nothing worked for longer than a few hours. not only does this truly hydrate and moisturize your skin, but it also leaves it feeling so smooth. and i can finally wear foundation again without my skin looking dry and cracked. absolutely worth every penny. saved my skin!",positive
"i really like the smell. it is more of a masculine musky type. it is too strong for me to sleep with but i do like wearing it or even taking occasional deep inhales. i do not however, notice any calming effects or overall changes in mood",neutral
"i really loved the water cream but for the winter i noticed my skin was dry so i purchased the dewy skin cream and it seemed good,and very moisturizing,but after about a month i noticed small breakouts around my chin and jaw i never thought it would be this,but as soon as i stopped using it my skin slowly started to clear. i am so sad. i gave it stars because it is very hydrating and clears up dry patches,a little goes a long way.",neutral
"i have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks that bothers me. after using this for months, i only see slight fade. i will keep using it, and update if anything changes.i received this as a free sample.",neutral
"i am a fan of this eye cream moisturizer! it glides on effortlessly and rubs in really well. this absorbs quickly and makes my skin look supple. i love to use this under makeup as it provides a great base and never makes my makeup cake up, total fan!",positive
i really wanted this to work but it always stung when i applied it!,negative
you really needs to use it with another serum at first but after its perfect.,positive
this stuff is amazing. totally helped with my uneven texture and just so nice and lightweight on the skin. my only complaint is that it is not available in a larger size because i went through it pretty fast.,positive
"there are soooo many asian, european, and australian sunscreens with great ingredients for less than. why this one is oily and almost is just shameful.",negative
did not like this one mainly because it made me break out. my skin was soft but not the worth the breakouts.,negative
i wanted to love this since i have oily acne-prone skin but it leaves my face tacky and after a few minutes oily. maybe i am spritzing too much product?- spritz. but i like it for when i wash a mask off. i am torn.,negative
"i am a verified purchase, did not get this as a gift. i have to say it is a larger bottle than i thought. the smell is really bad, it takes about-seconds to fade and smells like some sort of fermented pickle plant. it has a nice feel but after a couple of weeks of daily use, i am not sure it is making a difference on my dark spots. with the smell, i am only using it on the sides of my face where the spots are because it is strong. i normally do not mind fragrance in products, and love perfume, but you need to be prepared!",neutral
"i have never really loved a product instantly until now. this cream is outstanding. it is not greasy, and is the perfect balance between lightweight and heavy cream- by that i mean it was the perfect amount of moisture, while still leaving my skin feeling naked in a good way. it felt like my skin absorbed it immediately. it is been a few days, but i definitely feel like my skin overall looks healthier. excited to see even more results after more time.",positive
"i received a free sample of the inkey list mandelic acid treatment from pinchme. i myself have had a good experience with the sample i was given. i suffer from acne, so i have a lot of pigment discoloration and scaring. it does take a bit of time, but my skin looks more even than it did before i started using it.",positive
"i thought this was suppose to help with puffy eyes, but instead i work up in the morning with even puffier eyes!",negative
i gave it a good test. i bought and used both. noticed no changes in my skin. right after i used it my skin was hydrated. but mins after it was back to being normal. it has a greasy residue. not worth the price. also no noticable anti anging properties.,negative
it is very hydrating and moisturizing. i have not been using it long enough to be able to tell a difference in my skin. the reason i am only giving it starts is because it smells awful. i do not know how more people are not commenting on the smell. it makes me not want to use it.,neutral
"toner is not a necessary part of skincare for me or for anyone else. so it takes a special product to convince me to spend money on it. we are all so use to ahas as a chemical exfoliant, and for us dry skin babes, it is gospel. however. i have recently discovered that my face became much more sensitive after using multiple aha products. i found that using the ordinarys peel, which is a must once a week, piling in more aha was sensitizing. i tried the glycolic toner from to and after a month, could not beat the stinging and sensitivity. i decided to try this out, as i do not cleanse in the morning and like to use something to gently wipe away night masks and heavy oils. it is so gentle. it is so moisturizing. and it gives me a clean feeling. i have noticed a more even texture to my skin, and it is even a bit brighter. i love the lightness of the formula and the ingredients are clean and excellent. farmacy is fast becoming one of my favorite lines overall, and i am so pleased with this launch. i rotate it with glow recipes toner and i absolutely attribute my glow to these products! for the price point also, cannot beat this excellent toner!",positive
color does not look natural. has an orangish color to it. i will probably return this product.,negative
i had a bad reaction to this product. it has such a heavy fragrance and my skin is sensitive and i suffer with acne. i broke out so bad and it took me a couple weeks to recover. if you are good with heavy fragrance it smells wonderful. i did not like the little beads that exfoliating the skin. it felt like different size chunks and it was scraping my skin.,negative
"i do not usually write reviews but this product actually changed my skin. i have dry skin and i was so flaky with really enlarged pores that i could not even wear foundation without feeling really bad about myself. i went to sephora looking for a peeling and ended up buying this which was the best purchase of my year! i have been using it for almost a month and my skin is extremely better! my pores are back to normal, my skin does not look dull at all and the fine lines that insisted on appearing beside my lips are gone. if you use it with a good vitamin c then the results are even better. now i can finally wear make up without any worries and i will definitely purchase it again because it is a miracle for your pores.",positive

"i received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. i wanted to love this so much. the bottle is beautiful, it feels really nice going on, and i did not mind the smell like some other reviewers did. however, i broke out horrible on my chin after a few uses. i have relatively dry skin so i was surprised but could not continue using so gifted to my aunt.",negative
"i honestly cannot say enough good things about this cleanser! i have combination skin and have always struggled with blackheads around my nose and chin, with dry patches around my cheeks. it took about a month, but all of a sudden i looked in the mirror and noticed my blackheads were gone and my pores were so tiny. just a pea-sized amount rubbed into my face with my hands, and it gets my skin clean without stripping everything. saved my skin for sure!",positive
"i was able to try this product and i was only mildly impressed. first it does take a while to absorb, my face looked a little shiny for a while. i found it best to use this serum at night before bed or first thing in the morning. it did help keep my acne down and cleared up my face. i did not notice any difference with lines, but i do not have many. this product is good overall, best for continued use!",neutral
"this is a very balmy cleanser. i bought it to use as a makeup remover and it did not do a good job. so now i have been using it for about months as a cleanser, also not great. as a balm, it is challenging to squeeze out of the tube and sometimes oil spurts out like the balm melted. sure this is a pretty cheap cleanser but i do not like wasting extra product that squirts out. overall, not a good cleanser for my combooil skin and i will not be repurchasing.",neutral
"this tinkles in a good way when applied to the eyes, and helps to wake me up in the morning.",positive
"it leaves my face sticky all day, it never seems to soak into my skin. ugh, feels like a waste of money.",negative
perfect tan to build but stay natural.... never used self tan before and it worked perfectly! great for rookies and veterans of self tan!,positive
the best makeup removing balm i have used! does not strip the skin and does not sting your eyes. also comes with a little spatula so you do not get makeup in the product.,positive
"truth be told, i have yet to find a dr. jart product that really, really excites me. i keep getting them in boxes and things, and i just have not found one that really excites me. that being said, i purchased this because of all the hype on social media. i liked the idea that i could use it to tone down redness and get that no makeup look without makeup- which is how it is advertised. unfortunately, i was not wowed. at all. i do not love the smell. it is not what turned me away from this product, but it is worth noting for others who might be sensitive to that kind of thing. i do have some redness, but not a lot. when you apply it, it becomes more beige... and it was not a great look. i found that it was hard to spread, like i really had to work to move the product on my face, but adding more felt like overkill. it felt thick and heavy on my face. the best way to describe it would be like those unfortunate moments in life when you need makeup on short notice, so you dig through your car and find an old, barely moist, cream to powder foundation and try to make it work. you grind it into your face. and it feels like you are wearing a mask for the rest of the day. it did not really match my skin. it looked heavy and kind of powdery. it settled into every line on my face. not love.",negative
"yes it is a good eye cream but the bottle is so awkward that i do not reach for it. it is got a very small neck, it comes with a spatula but....if you lose the spatula your left digging this out with your fingernail.",neutral
better than any hyaluronic acid i have ever used. one of the few skincare notmakeupy products that i feel gives me the glass skin look,positive
i always wanted to try this product because i had heard great things when you used products they offered together. i have normal skin that does not typically break out so i am rather lucky. the moisturizer is thick and creamy and will go a long way. my skin felt very smooth after using it. the smell is not overwhelming at all. i look forward to seeing long term results. i am very happy with my short term results and how it left my skin feeling after using it. trywithtopbox freeproduct,positive
"i struggle with this because i really like the color it gave me, but it is very runny. i have had to put a nd layer of my regular lotion on it halfway through the day because my skin is so dry. so, great for color, but not for moisturizing!",neutral
i switched to this gentler face wash when i had a bad head injury which resulted in a lot of stitches. it was great for washing the injured part of my head during that time. i will be switching back to a different face wash though for anti-aging benefits.,positive

sooooo orange and extremely difficult to remove. would give stars if i could,negative
"this is a decent oil and it worked fine with my skin, but i cannot give it more stars because i will not be repurchasing. it has a distinct sweetfloralchemical smell that i cannot stand. i cannot really describe it, i just know that i do not like it. given the price, i recommend getting a sample of this before committing to buying.",neutral
i received this from buzzagent to try and love it. it makes my skin look smooth covers everything but still lightweight. great color match too,positive
i suffer from bad undereye problem and i have used a lot of high end brands. i kind of like it. will not say it is a miracle in a bottle but it has helped me to smoothen my undereye. i like using it. has reduced my dark circles,positive
everyone should read the ordinary do not mix chart on their website before using any other product with this one. at first i was scared to use this product since i have combination skin and this is a oil formula. it kind of sits on my skin so i apply this at night time after cleansing and i do not use any other product with it because i am worried it might counter effect. after using it for weeks i have noticed the couple of dark spots that i had on my face started to fade. i will continue using every other night alternating between the buffet which i love.,positive
this serum is pleasant to use but i have not noticed a crazy difference. what is really annoying though is that the tube on the pump is so short that once you get under half the bottle it barely works and you have to unscrew the pump.,neutral
waaaay too glowy for my liking. it makes me look too shiny and not in a natural way,neutral
i bought this as it had been recommended as a good oil for sensitive skin that will not break you out but i had white heads pop up overnight upon the first use. smells nice though so i just use it for my scalp now.,negative
"i was very excited to try this product. it has an excellent texture, and it beads up nicely to exfoliate. however, it is loaded with fragrance, and after using this a couple times, it broke me out. if it did not have the fragrance, i would probably have given this a stars.",neutral
i received this for free thanks to influenster. i am not a fan and did not notice a difference in my skin at all. i do like the bottle but will not be purchasing this product in the future.,neutral
got a rash from this product plus the dispenser broke after second use,negative
it does neutralize redness but it is just too greasy feeling for me. i am going to pass on this.,neutral
"easy to apply and dries quickly, and i did notice the couple blemishes i had went away more quickly than i normally would have. reminds me of a clay face mask i have used in the past, which i also loved! my only challenge was that once it dried, the paste fell off pretty easily, but maybe that was user error!",positive
there is not much in this tube and it does not smell good but it works. i had acne on my forehead i could not get rid of possibly fungal acne and this worked after one time.,positive
"i do not work for sunday riley. so, you can actually believetrust this review. it is an okay product... i guess. i have been using it faithfully for weeks now and i cannot see a single improvement. my skin has not worsened, so that is a plus... i guess. but it sure has not improved like even in the slightest. and, for the cost of this product it wouldshould have been at least slightly noticeable. spend your money elsewhere i am going to. the cost does not justify mediocrity.",negative
"i originally got this as a sample size with my sephora insider points. i typically have sensitive, oily skin but now use rosehip oil on it which has really balanced it. however, i feel that it also has left my skin looking a little bit dull, so wanted to try a moisturizer on top to try to brighten up my complexion. this moisturizer smells incredible, and i love the way it feels when it goes on. i definitely noticed my skin looking brighter and more dewy as well, almost instantly. it also seemed to calm my natural tendency towards redness. unfortunately, after a couple weeks of denial, i had to admit that it was making my face break out. i stopped using it and everything cleared up. i loved it so much that i decided to try it one last time and almost instantly, noticed blemishes and blackheads pop up. i hope you are luckier than me, because this was amazing in every other way!",neutral
"this is the serum version of tower beautys facial mist. it was what i expected it to be. it is a simple hydrating serum. it feels lightweight. it is not sticky. ideal for anyone with dehydrated or sensitive skin. i was not blown away by it but it is fine. main con is that it smells like pool water. i prefer the spray form, but if you prefer serums over mists this may be worth a shot. gifted by tower beauty",neutral
"i would describe this as more of a treatment than a moisturizer. it does not feel very moisturizing at all, so i have to use my regular moisturizer anyway. it might work better for people with oily skin. other than that is has a very strong medicinal scent, which is expected with tea tree oil. i know tea tree has benefits for the skin, but this is a pretty high concentration so it feels kind of overly strong.",negative
"did not do anything for me, i did not notice any change after using for two weeks.",negative
bought this and thought i loved it. then i finished it and started to use the clinique version and i quickly realized how much i did not like this product. it is way to thick and found myself pulling on my skin to get it clean so much more than when i used the clinique one. the clinique one is so soft and moisturizing. this one feels like rubbing cream cheese on your face just thick and unpleasant.,neutral
"i think this is a great product that just did not agree with my skin. the consistency is heavenly and unlike any sunscreen i have ever used. unfortunately it did make me breakout, maybe due to the essential oil. great product otherwise.",neutral
"was recommended this product for my dark spots at the sephora store so i bought it. after months of almost everyday use i have noticed barley any difference in the color of my spots. they became slightly less dark and more red but that is it. however this product does contain ahas which is not only supposed to help with lightning the hyperpigmentation but also improving skin texture. so thus this toner acts as a chemical exfoliant due to its ingredients and if you look at my picture it does that well. i do not know why my skin looks lighter in the after but i took both pictures in the same place and around the same time of day. if you look close you will see a lot less skin colored bumps, especially in my chin area. also i like that it does not make my skin dry after applying which other toners do. all in all this toner does work to better texture but not so much for dark spots...at least not for me.",neutral
"i have been using this product on and off and it made my hands turn orange and smell like metal! i thought it was a medical problem, because it happened so frequently. turns out the vitamin c oxidizes on the hands which is why it looks like there is fake tanner on my hands. the product did not even help my skin.",negative
"do not normally leave reviews. broke out into tiny, hive-like zits all over my face and neck where i applied it. yes, i am sure it was this serum- after the first time i experienced the breakout was using a new caudalie moisturizer from the same rewardsample, i took a months-long break from it...then kept my entire routine the same except for adding this serum. same breakout!! i do not consider my skin to be sensitive, so everyone please be wary of this product!",negative
"so oily! this is not intended for someone with oily skin. it smellllls soooo good, but too oily. this would probably be perfect for someone with really dry skin.",neutral
"helps a little with smaller inflammations, but in no way this is an effective way to treat acne",neutral
i want to love it but it made me breakout so much. even in places i do not normally breakout.,negative
the texture of this sunscreen is great and i love the tube it comes in. i was really excited to try this product out but it was way more glittery than i expected. the glitter also transferred onto my clothes and my couch i sat on while wearing it. my teenage self would have been all over this but my late s self was hoping for more of a sheer glow and less gold glitter.,neutral
"this product smells great and feels great on the skin but it does not really do much. i bought it so it could help some acne scarringdark spots, but after using a whole bottle it did not change anything. for the price, it is over hyped.",neutral
"i found this too heavy for my skin. i would not reccomend this too people who are oily like myself. i always looked and felt greasy and i was only using a drop. however, my bf has dry skin and it works good for him.",negative
"i would have love this product if it does not burn on my skin. i put it on just fine but the next morning, i see red spot that feels like sunburn. i think the glycolic overnight cream is just not for everyone.",neutral
"this product feels nice and thick when you put it on, but does not absorb into the skin well at all- ends up clumping and is very visible",negative
"i was really excited to try this when i saw it launched and got a mini size in the farmers market bundle farmacy has. i normally use tatcha water cream in the morning and it provides my skin moisture without getting greasy at the end of the day. by the end of the first day when i first used daily greens, i was really oily and shiny. it was not terrible and i am going to use it consistently for a few more days to see if it gets better, but i was really excited to try this and was let down.",neutral
"look- this product is ineffectual, but not harmful thus the stars. shortly after applying it sloughs off in those weird chunks since it clearly does not penetrate into the skin but remains on the surface. it feels good applying but within min is rolling off and skin feels dry. i am naturally very skeptical of any topical product that lists collagen as an ingredient as collagen molecules are too large to penetrate the topical skin barrier. i wish i could say that in all caps but i do not want to yell. if collagen is listed on a topical cream as an ingredient... here is your sign to be wary. this is also a newer product which sephora and other beauty boxes are clearly promoting hardcore... i wanted to like it, purchased at full price from an in-store recommendation, but immediately hated. the basic drugstore cetaphil moisturizer has better effect!",negative
i used this regularly until the bottle was empty and while it was nice and gentle i did not notice an improvement in my skin redness and texture. it was a nice way to start into the chemical exfoliation though and get my skin used to it,neutral
"oh my godthis is my favourite oil and i am sure that i will purchase this again.my skin never felt and look better.this gives me glow,hydration and my blemish situation is a lot better.i love love love love this oil.i am using this with kiehls ultra facial cream and this is my favourite combo.",positive
this product did not impress me as much as i thought it would. i feel like this mask is overrated.,neutral
this product is magic! it has really faded my dark spots. it is not drying to the skin at all. i was worried it would be but i follow up with this product with a good moisturizer and it does me well. would recommend.,positive
received this for free for a fair review. overall i think this is a nice supplement to an existing skincare regimen. i love this on days my skin is feeling extra clogged- mainly after hiking all weekend and using lots of sunscreen. i use this on my t-zone specifically and then followed with a light extraction. worked well.,positive
it is drying on my combination skin and my cheeks feel tight and dry. good thing i tried the small size first. i like the texture and the subtle scent but i will look further.,neutral
you get what you pay for with this product. you will have to double cleanse but it does leave a nice soft feel after. the biggest let down was the smell. it is too strong and not great.,neutral
"i feel badly rating this low because i should have considered that it is a cleansing balm and not a typical face wash, but as others here have mentioned, it leaves a residue behind that does not wash off. it does take makeup off well, but i would not recommend it personally",negative
so i have very acne prone skin and have tried a lot of salicylic acid products. i received this full size cleanser in my summer fab fit fun box. i honestly liked it in the beginning. it was good for summer time when my skin tends to be more oily and i did enjoy the hint of tea tree oil scent most of the time i find this scent too strong in products that have it but after awhile i became bored and it did nothing for my pores. was not good for me in the winter time either. i am glad i have finally used the last of this product and i will not be rebuying. does not compare to my go to good morning cleanser from cosrx,neutral
"i tried a little free sample packet with a purchase i would made on sephora. i was glad for the sample as i would had this product on my wish list and might have purchased it, otherwise since i was so impressed with this brands all-in-one moisturizer.the little free sample packet lasted at least- applications on my face. a little goes a long way with this lotion and it spreads on nicely. i did feel like it also made my skin look quite nice and glowy once applied...which made me even more prepared to give this product a positive review and maybe even buy a full size...however, i was not a big fan of the scent. not being picky with scents especially since you only really smell it when you are first applying it and it was not so offensive that i could not tolerate it, this was not a deal-breaker for me. what was a deal-breaker, though, was that i did not feel like this moisturized my skin for more than a couple of hours. after a couple of hours, my skin was starting to feel a little dry and thirsty again. this was very disappointing considering the surprisingly good results i have had with the all-in-one nourishing face cream!for this reason, i will not be making a full purchase of this product, after all, and have removed it from my list.i see there are still sample packets available with a purchase at checkout. perhaps i will give it a second try...if there are no other samples that interest me more! but for now, i cannot fully endorse this product. maybe it will work well for some other skin-types, but it did not provide the type of hydration my skin needs.",neutral
one of the main things i like about this toner is that there is not any alcohol but i however could not get past the sticky feeling it left on my skin. i initially thought it was due to me using too much but when i tried less i still experienced stickiness. aside from that is hydrating so that is a plus!,neutral
"i received a deluxe sample bottle in a sephora play box. while i like that the serum is easily absorbed, i cannot get past the smell. its not only offensive, but strong and long-lasting. they were better off making an unscented serum rather than this smelly stuff. it needs to be reformulated!",negative
"i really enjoy this product! i apply it when i get up in the morning and let it sink in before makeup. feels very cooling, brightening, and soothing on my sleepy eyes!",positive
"natural.. beware! breakouts!! i do not know, i normally do not have sensitive skin but this mask caused almost hive like break outs and bumps on my skin. do not purchase unless you have tested this on a small area. i am never buying anything from this line! my skin was very irritated see pic and there is something that is in this product that triggered it.",negative
love this stuff! goes on incredibly smooth and it works as a nice moisture barrier in the high desert. great alone or mixed with a bb cream for a little coverage.,positive
"great product, especially for the price. will buy again. my face feels so clean after use, and the smell is not all that bad, almost like apple cider vinegar. the only thing is it can be sticky afterwords, which might feel a little irritating.",positive
"this serum is so nice, i keep it in my skincare fridge so that it keeps the vitamin c from going bad. this vitamin c serum does not smell like regular vitamin c serums and has added benefits other than just vitamin c. i put this on before bed under the new tatcha dewy skin cream and i love them both! i wake up with such soft bright skin that i could see a difference the very first morning!",positive
very lightweight. no overpowering scent. like that the black and white package design. very business like. you just know this product will get down to business.,positive
the product had too much of a watery substance inside the sealed packaging. the patches do not stick well,negative
"takes off my makeup well, love the smell, feels luxurious and does not irritate my skin at all. i usually use it as a first step in two step cleansing.",positive
i love this product i finally found the product that is match in my skin. i have very sensitive skin and prone to acne but from the first time i used this product my skin looks brighter and healthy. the only downside is the price.,positive
"i was hesitant to buy because of the plastic container, since i abhor plastic and usually go to great lengths to not buy anything in plastic. alas, i was desperate to keep my face from flaking off. many of the reviews said it was great for dry skin-super thick and moisturizing-so i bought the large container when it was on sale. i was hoping it would be a relief for my usual dry, but winter ravaged face. it worked really well for about weeks, then the black and white heads showed up on my nose, around my mouth, and cheeks. omgoddess! i had not had a blackhead since i was! and i had not changed any other face skin product while using this, so it had to be the because. sure glad i did not pay full price! it does, however, work super well on my cracked heels and dry legs and was not a total loss of purchase product, but when empty, add another pieced of daed plastic to the trash bin.",negative
this acne treatment is a non-drying treatment which i did not care for because i was not sure if i was supposed to rub it in or leave it to dry. it goes on without color or residue so i was able to use it during the day under my mask. i saw it was most effective on white heads versus under the surface pimples.,neutral
"i was excited to try this toner because i have dry acne-prone skin and i liked that it was mildly exfoliating and hydrating. however, i found it kind of drying and astringent, and i did not notice any positive impact on my skin breakouts etc. it was fine, but i will not be buying it again. i can see this being a great choice for someone with oily skin.",neutral
"i purchased the set, which included this serum. a store employee suggested this to me for my hyperpigmentation. she said it really helped her so i bought into it. when i first started using it, i was using too much and it made my skin very oily. i cut down the amount i was using and that remedied the oiliness. i finished the bottle and did not notice much of a difference on my hyperpigmentation. it did make my pores appear small, and have some sort of glow. i repurchased the kit because my mom liked the glow it gave her skin. we have both moved on from this product now and will not be repurchasing it.",negative
"i wanted to love this, the colour develops quick and is beautiful, i recommend to start with less drops! however i have large pores on my face and what i did not love was that each little pore had a tan dot in it. i have used other self tanning products that did not do this. i liked the idea of mixing it in my lotion, that made it a flawless application but for my skin i did not like how it sat in my pores. i would recommend if you do not have large pores.",neutral
"the ct magic cream is a good face cream which moisturizes without being too heavy, in fact the lightness of the product is one of its most appealing attributes. it is not oily feeling per se, but it has the positive attributes of an oilier cream in that it glides onto the skin and feels like it penetrates into the skin. that said, as someone with dry skin, i personally prefer something more hydrating and so for me personally this cream is s but for many of you this would be a four or five because it is a good cream and is probably plenty hydrating for someone with normal skin. i also think the hydration level is probably fine for someone with moderately dry skin or in the summer when you do not need as much producthydration. personally i think the best use of this product is for prepping your skin for a full face of makeup and if it was sold solely for that purpose i would rate it higher stars. my only issue with this product is that i feel it is pricey for what it is. it reminds me a bit of ponds coldcream both in texture and in it is scent. that said it is a far better quality in that ponds cold cream is one of the few products that will give me a breakout and this product kept my skin clear and healthy looking. so overall it is a good product, especially for skin-prep for makeup but i got mine for free from infiuenster snd personally would not have purchased this type of product for this much money. fyi i use drugstore face cream in the a.m. and high-end pricey products in the p.m. so i am open to both drugstore and willing to spend on high-end. this product just does not feel like s high-end product to me and therefore is not worth the high price-tag.",neutral
gifted by dermalogica sampling a bit harsh especially the first time i was like woah i recommend trying to mix it on something rather than just the hands so you can really get a paste. also if you have more sensitive skin like myself i would not recommend using every night or even every two nights to be honest. definitely in moderation. but i do think it exfoliated my skin well and it purged a lot of things out.,neutral
"i was excited to try this product as i have very large pores and subsequently, lots of blackheads. i have only been using the product for weeks not but so far have not seen a difference in my pore quality. the scent is also a bit off putting- it smells exactly like listerine!- and it is a bit difficult to apply evenly to the face given the consistency. however, weeks may not be long enough to see the positive effects- will update if i notice any improvements.",neutral
make me feel so sticky after using it and make my face looks so shiny! so disappointed,negative
"it is cute. it is a great concept, but it does not hydrate my dry skin enough for the nighttime alone. it glides on nicely, and i do see my acne scars going away and heeling quicker than before use. however, this serum does not make my skin glowy or bright. for the price, it is a little gimmicky, but i will continue to use it until it runs out and will not repurchase.",neutral
"i was so excited to receive this in a play! box and try it out with good genes. i had heard the hype and i love good genes so of course i thought this would be the next step toward skin perfection. i know it is an oil. and i know my skin can be acne prone. common sense would have told me to not try it. but i did it anyway. i tried it for two weeks, alternating one night retin-a and one night luna. i stuck it out, even though it smells like a rancid, greasy corn tortilla. yes, i massaged it in. two weeks later, my entire face is covered in acne pustules. i can only blame myself. seriously, if oils make you break out in pimples, this is not the product for you. during the two weeks i tried luna, i did not notice a difference in the appearance of fine lines or dryness yes i have dryness or redness. my face did not look brighter and my skin did not look less dull. for those reasons and not the breakout, which is my own problem, i give it stars.",negative
lile the light scent and texture and love the brand overall but unfortunately it was not enough for my dry skin even mixed with a serum. not their fault. will work for oily or normal skin!,neutral
this stuff is my holy grail! it literally so easily just melts my makeup right off and makes the process so much less of a pain!!! i see other reviews about it leaving a film and i do not have that problem. i have no complaints about this stuff! if you want to make your life easier get it!,positive
was super excited to try this. always looking for a good sunscreen. overall i was not really impressed by this product. the packaging makes dispensing a little weird. it is really watery so you have to shake really well. i liked that it is a mineral sunscreen and has pretty good ingredients. did not like how it felt on my skin. felt greasy and it did not absorb into the skin. could not wear under makeup for that reason. it would make my foundation all slippery. used it for a whole month and did not notice any positive changes in my skin.,negative
it was a bit too oily for me. the formula was a little gritty as well,neutral
i got a complimentary sample from influenster and i am so thankful i got to try this product not only it is gentle but i feel that my skin is always so fresh and clean. it smells good too! i have only used it about times but i can feel my skin smoother. i will definitely keep using and see if this is the product i have been searching for! will definitely recommend to my friends!,positive
"i have severely dry skin, and this does not really sink into my skin, it more so sits on the surface and does not absorb. on a not as dry day, i find that this works a bit better. however, it is overall not a bad product, i just personally need something a little more hydrating!",neutral
"smells great. does not irritate my sensitive skin. however, it has not drastically changed my skin for the better. i have very textured skin and i was hoping this exfoliant product would help, it has not.",neutral
great colour and easy to apply but it does not seem to last very long!,neutral
"been using this serum for years now, and i would not dream of using anything else, the way it feels when you apply, with the different chains of h acid in this serum you can feel it penetrating the layers, and not just sitting on the surface like some cheaper serums, it leaves you feeling hydrated and that feeling lasts all day, it is a life saver before eye cream it fills in the lines with hydration so you need to use less eye cream, and long term in very happy with the anti age property in this serum, people always comment that i do not age! like that way my bare skin looks using this product! fresh and healthy",positive
i like using this product on no make up day order my eyes in the morning but only feel the cooling effect for a minute. it leaves a balm-likethick coat that ultimately leaves me feeling less refreshed. it definitely would be better if it were thinner and more hydrating.,neutral
"i seem to be in the minority, but i did not like this product. i am a clinique fan, years ago i had sensitive, oily skin with breakouts and cliniques dramatically different moisturizing gel was the only lotion i could use. i now have sensitive, combo skin that turned super dry for the first time this winter. this product seemed like the perfect fit, because as much as i really need moisturizer, too much can still make my face oily. when i first went to put this on it had a chemical smell masking fragrance? but that went away quickly. the cream felt nice and was mostly absorbed in a minute so it seemed promising. but then an hour later my skin was dry and tight again crying out for more moisturizer! i would not recommend this for dry skin. i also would not recommend it for oilycombo skin because at for.oz i feel like there are better options out there for less, including from clinique.i received a free product for my honest review.",negative
really think and creamy cleanser literally like putting lip balm on your entire face.,neutral
i decided to try these after seeing a box in the store and reaching good reviews. they did absolutely nothing for me besides wax my cheeks. the pimples did not shrink or change at all and i already used of the stickers over night on different size pimples.,negative
i am not sure why i am having such a different experience than everyone else.. but i do not feel like this oil does much. it kind of sits on top of my skin. i have layered it all different ways. it in turn does not absorb and leaves my super sensitive skin still feeling very dry. i liked the kora organics oil better.,neutral
i stopped using this because it just was not moisturizing enough for my skin. i have dry skin with rosacea. i was using this combined with their serum and my skin broke out and was left feeling dry.,neutral

useless. i followed the instructions exactly placed it on a wet nose and nothing. it removes nothing zero difference!,negative
"i work in healthcare and i love applying this as the last step in my skincare where i would be wearing a mask all day. this is a maskne blocker for sure. i have not gotten any since i started doing this. i do not wear any face makeup over this though, so i would not count on this review if you do because i am not sure how it would set.",positive
worked great in clearing up my acne. i have struggles with acne since. i would get cystic acne which would leave dark scars even if i did not pick at it. i have been using it for almost weeks now and definitely notice a difference. i use this in combination with several other to products to fight acne and clear up my hyperpigmentation.,positive
fair price with a fair product... do not even think about remove your eye makeup. not strong enough for a heavier face makeup. also too thick as a cleansing oil. i prefer cleansing balms from clinique and pharmacy. if using a cleansing oil it is better be light and smooth. only good for very light makeup. one pro on this product is it is friendly to sensitive skin. i would not buy it again though.,neutral
"amazing product! after using a retinol wrinkle cream on my face, i broke out like crazy i also have consistent mild adult acne and for weeks after i stopped using the cream i was still seeing bumps all over my face. this stuff worked in less than a week! the first few days of use i found that a lot of the bumps were surfacing and coming to a head. by day, my skin was smoothing out and clearing up. this product also reduces the appearance of pores--by that i mean that, when i applied it in the morning and then put tinted moisturizer over it for the day, my pores were not nearly as visible. i would not say that it actually makes pores smaller i do not think any product can do that, but this stuff seems to act almost like a primer in smoothing out your skin when applied.",positive
"i first used this during my mid twenties when anr was still the original formula- before it underwent god knows how many reincarnations. back then i used to find it would help a little with the odd acne mark that would appear every few weeks but did little else for my skin concerns. i was primarily using it in the hopes of some sort of defense against future ageing, but i cannot say whether or not it achieved anything, as once the bottle ran out i started using other products and then recently thought why not give it another go?so onto the latest version synchronized recovery complex which i tried earlier this year. i do not know if it is the fact that tocopherol acetate vitamin e has been pushed down to th place on ingredients list used to be th, or whether it is because retinyl palmitate an ester of vitamin a has been completely removed from the new version, but this one did not do anything for acne marks whatsoever and i used it for over a month. it makes sense as both of those ingredients, especially vitamin a in any form, are known to help fade marks. add to that a whole host of new and unpronounceable ingredients and that probably explains why if anything i would experienced even more breakouts when using this...although which one or more of the many new ingredients is the culprit i could not say! not sure why they just could not let a good thing be and have to changeruin it? my sephora top must-have list my top must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at sephora. hair loss treatment divine herbal- hair oil. shampoo sephora collection- deep cleaning shampoo. face mask peter thomas roth- pumpkin enzyme mask. pigmentation anti-aging serum divine herbal- facial treatment serum. face scrub sisley- botanical gentle buffing cream. lip balm nuxe- reve de miel lip balm.lip liner sephora collection- rouge gel lip lin",neutral

"i can see this working for someone with dryer skin. however, this is not for normal or combination skin. it is so greasy, does not absorb into skin just sits on top. i like the skinfix serum that has done wonders for my skin, i thought this would be just as light, but it is a heavy cream.mousturizers like this are not for me.",neutral
this broke my skin out so bad and that is all did for me! such a regret buying this. every shiseido product i have bought gives me pimples and i never break out. i will stick with sunday riley i actually get results with that and zero breakouts,negative
"not sure this mask accomplishes the task of resurfacing. there is no scent, which is supposed to be a positive but i was disappointed. the charcoal dots were only plentiful on the top so that it looked like cookies and cream upon opening...the majority of the container was the whipped white mask. i will not be buying it again.",neutral
"i am on the fence with this product... it does what everything claims it will, it really smooths your face. silky smooth skin is awesome.however after many weeks of use i notice that i tend to have more acne when using this than not.add in the plastic packaging and crappy pump, i am not that impressed.",neutral
"i was looking for a moisturizer and i have tried the peace out acne spots and loved them, so i decided to try this. i did not see any difference when using it. it is lightweight and lists a lot of wonderful ingredients, but the second ingredient, neopentyl is alcohol. on the bright side, the shelf life is months, so you have a full year to use it before it spoils.",neutral
"did not notice a change in my skin wether good or bad. it left a residue the first few times i used it. not a bad product, but i would not repurchase it.",neutral
"i do not write reviews often but i just had a horrible experience with this and i think people need more than the endless star reviews. even though this was pretty pricey, i fell in love with the idea of this product and biossances mission and everything. i got a sample of the squalane tea tree balancing oil that i liked so i thought to splurge on this full size as i wanted a vit c in my regimen. i do not have sensitive skin and i have only had mild acne growing up. while this felt nice upon application, my cheeks broke out all over in giant painful blemishes overnight, and not just unsightly blemishes but the giant painful ones that a teenager might have. i have never even had acne on my cheeks. i did not change anything else in my skin regimen-i know it was the oil, once i cut it out-my skin started calming down but it took weeks to return to normal. i have heard vitamin c in general can break your skin out but this was just horrific. i would say if there is any potential of having a history of blemishesacne-pass and look for something else. i am using mario badescus vit c serum now with no problem and it is half the price.",negative
"i really like the idea of this. but the packaging does not work properly... big headache. also, once you do get it to come out it does not blend well with makeup. not sure if the spf coverage is any good... i returned this item.",negative
dried my skin out. i love the makeup removing balm and the honey moon glow serum. i thought i would like this but i hated it.,negative

omg. i thought this was a perfume i had to double check the label. this strong of a fragrance does not belong on the face.,negative
"not bad, hydrating and easy to apply, but i did not notice any difference in my hyperpigmentation. you can give it a try, it is affordable and maybe it will work for you!",neutral
"boy do these miss the mark. for one they are a bit complicated to apply given they are all stacked together with sheets of protective film, and the serum is heavily dyed and will stain everything is comes in contact with. so unnecessary for an otherwise basic, functional eye mask.",negative
"i used this moisturizer last winter and my skin dryness and blemishes started going away. i repurchased it this winter and have been using it for months, it does not break me out at all and leaves my skin with no dry patches. i have a combination of oily and normal skin and it leaves my face looking soft and dewy all day. i also use the olehendriksen glowoh toner at night and my dark spots and acne scars seem to be fading. overall really like this moisturizer.",positive
i like that this is a thicker cream with no fragrance but i am. sure this product gave me perioral dermatitis and with more research i have now learned that the ingredient phenoxyethanol is an ingredient that has high chance of making you develop dermatitis so i will not continue to use unfortunately..,negative
"i have not seen any change from this product. i do not like the feel of it on my skin, its very sticky when applied. all in all i was not pleased with the product but there were no bad side effects.",neutral
it is liquid highlighter mixed with sunscreen. i looked like tin man after putting it on my whole face. i will continuing using it as highlighter and as a glowy body sunscreen but will not repurchase. it is a fun product though.,positive
this is the true makeup melting love of my life lol sometimes i use it even when i am not trying to take off my makeup just because i love the texture and formula lol,positive
i wanted to like this product when i received it as a sample however its much too oily for my skin and caused me to break out badly after one night of use. if you have super dry skin this will be a great product though.,neutral
"this product is okay, but i definitely do not think it lives up to the hype. it does correct redness pretty nicely, but it is super greasy and never feels like it absorbs into my skin. my foundation does not sit well on top of it, so i mainly use it for when i just need a little cover-up without makeup. i will not repurchase.",neutral
i have oily to combination skin that is been a bit on the drier side lately. i absolutely love this as a nighttime moisturizer! it is very thick so i take a tiny amount and warm it between my fingers before patting it in. i love it! it is a bit tacky for about min- hour after applying so i do not wear it under makeup.,positive
just got it delivered. the jar is mostly empty? the whole middle and part of the side had no product. is that normal for the minnie jars?,neutral
"for reference i have oily, dehydrated, acne prone skin.on paper this sounded perfect. however i think that the enzymes were maybe too much for me as it left my skin feeling more dehydrated and even a little flakey. not for me.",neutral
saved my skin! i have dry skin and hormonal acne! this helped a lot!,positive
this is a great product. makes your skin feel soft and moisturized. con the container is not full. air bubble where of the product should be. i will only buy again if this is address. and full. oz is given.,positive

intense scrub where? used this on both dry skin and wet skin did not make a difference either time. my skin felt exactly the same as before i used this.,negative
"this actually works cannot believe it. i was always struggling to find an eye for my black circles. i spent so much on expensive brand names and nothing worked. i was soo frustrated as nothing was helping me. i walked into sephora saw this product that i never heard about. i thought why not try it knowing that i would return it for sure, i was even debating if i should get it from the first place. i gave it a shot last night and the results are amazing. i did notice a huge difference under my eyes, it is almost as the dark circles has gone away completely. it is also very gentle and my under eyes feels soo smooth. i am in love with this product, worth every penny. the only thing is i wish they change the packaging to make it easier to apply. other than this product is a must",positive
"i enjoy trying new serums so i was happy to test this one out from influenster. i cannot speak to its effects because the samples sent were not much and did not last long enough to see results or not. i appreciate some of the ingredients in this serum, but fragranceparfum is high up on the ingredient listing and boy can you tell. the serum has a fairly pleasant scent, but i tend to lean towards fragrance-free skincare so this serum made me feel like i was wearing perfume to bed! there are so many better serums for your skin in my opinion. i would not pay the high price tag for this product.",negative
"this is certainly not worth the high price tag. the stars are for the product aside from price. it is kind of thick going on but does not feel greasy or heavy. it left a protective layer but i did not feel that it moisturized long term as well as products that are a fraction of the price and the texture is glue-y. french drugstore brands are far more effective. this also has a paint smell which i am surprised not more people have mentioned. it is celebrity endorsed and somewhat unique feeling i suppose, but it is pretty ho hum to be honest. if you are going to throw down that kind of cash you could have multiple high quality actives as opposed to a bougie face cream that is not really amazing.",neutral
"it says in the description oil-free but there are multiple oils listed in the ingredients. it caused major breakouts on my skin, so bummed",negative
"amazing!! this made my skin so plump, soft, and bright. i absolutely love this",positive
"this serum is amazing. i received this product to review from influenster, and honestly i am in love. i have used it for weeks now and my skin is glowing, not in the oily sense. my skin feels moisturized, plump, and happy, and i have noticed less fine lines. i have combination, acne-prone skin yay adult acne! and this does not break me out nor make me more oily. will be purchasing once i run out. great product!",positive
best night cream i have ever used! i have used it for past few days and i love it! i am noticing a huge difference in my skin. my skin is starting to look more hydrated and glowing!,positive

"i reeeeally wanted to like this toner. i have oily acneic skin and i thought this would be a good exfoliating toner to keep my pores clear which it does but my face does not like this at all. i do have relatively sensitive skin and i think my reaction may be from the citrus oils in this. that being said, i would still recommend this product to people who do not have sensitivity issues.",neutral
"i am on my second tube.... not sure i would repurchase though. i had high hopes that it would make a big difference but it has not had that much of an effect on my breakouts. i like that it is gentle, it leave my skin very soft, feels very clean after each use. i do not like that after each use it brings more acne to the surface than it clears.... maybe that is a good thing but it is mostly annoying because then i have more breakouts to treat. my take away is this it is just ok. it is not a miracle worker by any means. might work great for some and not for others.",neutral
"i loved the initial results from this product. it gives a nice level of exfoliation without being stripping or drying at all. however, long term the ingredients did break me out so overall it is a no for me",neutral

love this brand and i knew this sunscreen would be amazing! the packaging is super cute and fits perfectly in a purse. there is no scent which i enjoy. the formula is nice and thin and can easily been out overtop makeup or under! gifted by supergoop!,positive
the packaging is the worse!!! as the last product used at the end of the night- to deal with opening the lid is impossible without tweezers or small scissors i love all of the other fresh products but this one,negative
"this is my go to day moisturizer right now, i layer it over sunday riley good genes during the day and it gives you a great base for your make up, it looks amazing together!!!!",positive
i have such mixed feelings but i still keep repurchasing. if my skin liked the gold standard for vit. c- ascorbic acid- that is what i would choose. unfortunately my skin hates it so i am always trying to choose the second best. thd ascorbate looks promising and i trust sr to formulate it properly. i like ceo but it is too waxy. i use it when we are having cooler weather or on no makeup days. i do not need moisturizer afterwards and wait min. before applying sunscreen to give it a chance to hopefully absorb a bit. i use oh truth serum as a warm weather alternative. i do not get any notable brightening from this or any aa vit c alternative. i use it for vit. cs antioxidant properties which are very important especially in sunny florida.,neutral
"this is a lovely serum in lieu of an oil based one. it feels like a light cream when applied, but absorbs immediately leaving a hydrated glow all over. the scent is lovely. like peeling a clementine. it smells natural not synthetic.",positive
"okay, so i am going to be the one to say it.. i go through way too much cleansing balm to be paying- each time i need one. however, this one i would definitely keep repurchasing. first of all, i love that this is in a squeezy tube because i do not have to dig into a jar with acrylics, and it spreads nicely on the skin. i personally found the clinique one to be a bit too oily for me although i love the clean it gives, but if you are a fan of that one, this one is almost as good. if i could give it a. i would because occasionally i find myself having to add some more around my eyes but that is because i usually wear shimmery shadows. i do see what everyone is saying about a film being left and i do not think it is really a film, but then again my water really strips my skin. it actually leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, so i do not have complaints about a film. if you want to try the double cleanse method or have been looking to buy a cleansing balm, look no further! you cannot go wrong buying this one, especially for the price! you get oz of product!!!",positive
"i do not hate it but i do not love it. it rubs in well, does not leave any white residue, but i look kind of greasy after putting it on. also maybe it is just me but the smell to me is like a faint cool ranch doritos smell. maybe just me but that is the smell i get. by the end of the day though it has a metallic smell to it. not horrible, just weird.",neutral
"i had been using bare minerals oil cleaner for years, and unfortunately could not purchase from them due to the pandemic. this bobbi brown cleanser was the closest i could find with sephora, and was about more expensive. so, i had high hopes.pros smells nice, mostly does the jobcons takes about more oil cleanser than the prior mentioned product per use, otherwise it feels rough on the face. it is a thinner product... like almost watered down. for being a higher end product, i was not very impressed.",negative
"this is the type of product that you put high expectations and hope to work perfectly! unfortunately, this is a huge miss. as a woc this did not work out on my skin as it supposed to, it leaves kind of grey film on skin and it pills by leaving white residues!",negative

i decided to give up on la mer. this is just fragranced water in a bottle. does nothing for the skin. received it with some other la mer products in a gift set and tney are all crap. moving on,negative
this is the weirdest consistency that i have ever experienced. it feels like a regular cream at first then while applying it it starts to feel thicker like it is dragging across my skin. then the texture suddenly becomes watery. it even leaves what looks like white casts. once it dries down it feels normal. but this is the weirdest thing ever and it made me want to return it immediately.,negative
"i would give it a higher rating, but honestly i did not see a big difference on my skin. i used it every night for a few weeks and it might have worked, but i am not sure. not my favorite scent either. not a bad product, but not something i would purchase.",neutral
good toner it was just too strong for my skin and i did not care for the scent.,neutral
"i wanted to like this so much- i have combo skin oily t zone normal to dry cheeks and this always makes my oilier areas feel fresh but make the rest of my face feel stripped. i wish it was gentler. also, every morning after using this the night before, i will see that the bottle has pumped out a few drops of the cleanser. it is not the excess dripping off- it is literally something inside the pump, maybe the air pressure??, pushing the cleanser out. never had a pump behave like this. i have literally witnessed the cleanser moving out of the pump on its own. super disappointed with the quality of the bottle and will not be repurchasing.",neutral
i do not understand the hype. it literally sat in my pores and made them look bigger. followed the instructions and it does not do much for me.,negative
smells like pure turmeric. i am sure it works great. felt nice on my skin and woke up feelings nice but i felt sick with how intense it smelled. i would never be able to use this every day or even once a week.,negative
works wonderful. lovely smell or roses every time you put on. really pulls moisture to the skin.,positive

"i liked the consistency and how it felt. but for whatever reason or ingredient that is in this cream made my red spotseczema sting. i know the ingredients i am allergic to so i stay away but this did not have listed any of those so i figured i was safe. nope. with that said, i did not use it enough to see if it truly worked as a great moisturizer.",negative
love this toner! i struggle with finding new toners because of my acne prone skin. i use this one daily the glass bottle was a nice surprise,positive
was a great exfoliator at first then it broke the skin on my cheeks,neutral
this cream is nice. it is noticeably scented. i did not find the creme to be super rich- it has a good texture and is not super heavy. i found that it soaked in fairly quickly and worked well with my other skincare products. i think the price is a little hefty for the quality. i did not notice a difference in my skin after using it. i received a sample complimentary from influenster.,neutral
"i would skip this product. purchased it in hopes of increasingmaintaining a bit of youthful pep and elasticity to my orbital area and found that this cream did not deliver.it did not do any harm--which is good-- but it did not do any good either. it moisturizes alright, i guess, but the formula is extremely thick and greasy, which might be a plus if you like that kind of thing. to be honest, i did not feel like there was any skin-science magic happening after i slathered it on. and we all know what that good skin-science magic looks and feels like.in short, this product was an expensive let down that performed like a high-end whipped vaseline.",negative
i love to use this retinoal eye cream. i am using this cream week my dark circles get lighter i can see.,positive
i have combination skin. my forehead is very dry and thought this would help. after using for weeks morning and night nothing has changed. for the price it did not work for me.,negative
"this moisturizer is a great dupe for the drunk elephant peptide protini, it haha a great consistency, very gel like and not thick at all. it has excellent ingredients, however, it broke me out. i think this is because dimethicone is so high on the ingredient list. i use dimethicone in my skincare all the time but it is never up as high as it is on this. anyway, just something to think about if you are looking into this. i have dry, fair skin, for reference.",neutral
"i have received this product for free for testing purposes and i love it. the texture is really lightweight, it applies very nicely under makeup and helps makeup lasts longer. my skin quickly absorbs it and makes my skin feel super refreshed. my favorite way to use this product is actually under makeup. it is complimentary from glow recipe",positive
"i have this product. i was skeptical the first time because i have oily skin and thinking i am putting on an oil would make it worse but it is actually balanced the oil on my skin, got rid of my acne and really brightened my complexion taling out redness i did not noticed i had so kuchnof until i used this. i have rebought this a few times now and love it. the only thing is that it goes bad fast because it is more natural. i think that is why the company came out with smaller bottles which i am so thankful for. this has become one of my fav products! its expensive but worth it for me because it makes me feel like i can go make up free more confidently when i want to.",positive

perfect for redness. i love it after showering and before moisturizing. perfect for before makeup and refreshing throughout the day.,positive

this eye cream helped a bit when i applied before putting in my concealer but was not like magic happened and the fine lines and wrinkles had disappeared so i would not recommend considering the steep price of the cream.,neutral

it smells funny to me kind of like chalk and something i do not know. it takes a minute to rub in the skin. it is alright.,neutral
i just began using this and so far am happy. my only complaint is that it is so thin and slippery it is a little tough to apply. as i drop a bit on my cheeks it runs down my face before i have time to spread it around! i have started making a little zig-zags as i squeeze the dropper and that seems to help.,positive
it did make fine line lessen. i tried it around the lines around my mouth and work up to no lines. however by mid day they would return. would be good if you bwanred to look good an event.,negative
applied nicely on skin. it makes your skin glowy and very little white cast. i feel a cool sensational on my skin. everything looks great until hours later i check the mirror and shockingly find it pilling. i have to rub the pilling off my skin. i cannot imagine how much it will pill during the winter month when my skin tends to get drier.,neutral
before i purchase any product i usually do my research and read reviews. exactly what i read and saw is exactly what the product is. i am writing a review on the first day i am actually using the product and will update after mths of use. i realized that alot of product is not needed to cover face and i suggest that you follow the application instructions listed at the back of the tube.,positive
leaves my skin oily. i think it breaks me out as well. if you do not like products that leave your skin super greasy then i would not buy this. it does not sink it and i do not like how it feels. i also stained several shirts putting it on and it will not come out. not a fan,neutral
"as a woman with hormonal acne, retinol is a staple in my skincare routine, and this is one of the best i have found. i used sunday reilly a for a while, but it was expensive and the silicone congested my skin. this formalization does not have that issue and it is a fraction of the price. i use it every night followed by oilmoisturizer. try it. you will not regret it.",positive

if you have sensitive skin this scrub is not for you. the product smells like lemon yogurt which i am not too fond of. i would recommend if you are looking for a fruity scrub.,neutral
"this works very well on my skin. it does a good job of neutralizing the redness on my face down to a manageable level and actually plays very well with my very fair slightly olive undertone skin. my skin tends towards dryness or used to but is under control now, so i have not found it to be drying or clingy. i only use a basic moisturizer underneath and not even immediately beforehand. i can wear this on its own but sometimes find it best to add a drop or two of bronzing fluid to warm it up.",positive
i usually love all caudalie products. but the scent on this product is too strong. it is a very thick cream. definitely would not use it during the night. it is moisturizing though. will be returning due to the scent.,negative
"i have used retinol products in the past and they have always left my skin feeling dried out. dr. zenovias advanced retinol night repair treatment did not leave my skin feeling dry. i have been using this product for a few weeks and although not dramatic, i am seeing results! i have acne scars around my jawline from when i was younger and since using this product, they are definitely less noticeable. this product will remain a part of my nighttime skincare routine! excellent product!",positive
"i really wanted this to not be worth the money--but it is. my skin looked tighter and brighter immediately after the first application, but i was hooked as soon as i woke up in the morning. the overnight results were impressive. my skin was clearer, tiny breakouts that had been forming were gone, and my skin was so soft and smooth to the touch.my only note is that it took me a while to figure out the right routine using it for me. my skin is apparently way more forgiving than many i have read to use it ish times a week, but my skin responds very well to almost nightly use. i cringe at the cost, but my skin looks better than it ever has before. smell is pretty neutral, which is also a bonus for me.",positive
i have tried quite a few different toners. i got this originally as a sample and purchased the full-sized soon after. it definitely exfoliates so maybe not the best for very sensitive skin but leaves my skin glow-y and smooth after using it both day and night. love it.,positive
"this is by far the best moisturizer i have ever came across. usually, i wake up very oily especially since it is hot and now i do not. it is not like other moisturizers that leave your skin feeling too moisturizer, it is just right. my skin feels soft yet hydrated.",positive
this is very hard to get out! product is too thick and the oils seem so separate. takes off some make up definitely not all. as with any greasy cleanser you cannot use it on your eyes or the oils will get in you eye. it is very moisturizing and may work for a double cleanse routine.,negative
"i love the idea of this cleanser, did not love the outcome. i have had it for a few days now and my skin is showing signs of damaged skin barrier dryness, rough patches. unfortunately it is a return for me.",negative
"i was so excited to try this balm as i love that the company focuses on affordability and great ingredients. however, i was not a fan of the smell and it broke me out. i do not have sensitive skin, so unfortunately i will not be repurchasing.",negative
i bought packages and the first one i tried out did not really remove any of my blackheads. a little disappointed. i did follow the instructions too. hopefully the others will be better.,neutral
"as far as quality goes, this is a very good oil cleanser for removing makeup. i find that massaging for only seconds like the instructions say is not enough to take everything off, specifically mascara and heavy eyeliner seconds does the job, though. the formula is very lightweight and it has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.the reason i cannot give it five stars is that it is way, way too expensive and the ingredients do not justify it. every cleansing oil i have ever gotten from the drugstore has performed just as well as this product. furthermore, the ingredients do not actually do much as skincare, so there really is no reason for this to be so pricey.",neutral
"ok even with spraying on so much that i could feel it dripping off my face and using the go off wipes, it irritated my skin and left me to harshly scrub the makeup off",negative
"i am yo with fair, combination, acne-prone skin. i have used this product for just over two months and i can finally say that there have been noticeable improvements to my skin. i was frustrated because, for the first weeks, i did not notice any difference whatsoever. after using this every morning for months, i can see that my skin looks brighter and healthier. it did not fade any of my old acne scars, but it is helped clear new breakouts and has prevented those from leaving scars. i am not sure i will use this serum forever as i am hoping there may be a more effective one out there, but i will continue to repurchase until i find that next best thing.",positive
"this moisturizer has been incredible for the winter and eliminated my need for a face oil. its thick but does not really feel like anything once its on, and lasts through the day. i was shocked at how small the value size is though!",positive
"i have searched forever to find a face sunscreen like this! i used to even avoid sunscreen because of how much i hated it. i actually look forward to applying and wearing this everyday. not matte and not greasy, just a nice natural dewy finish- my skin looks the same as it did just after my moisturizer. it leaves zero white cast and blends into skin smoothly without being too liquidy. it also does not smell like sunscreen. it has a very slight coconut scent- nearly undetectable especially after a few minutes. perfect amount of spf. the bottle lasts longer than expected too. i use it on my face, neck, decollete, and backs of hands daily after my moisturizer. and you cannot beat the price!",positive
the reviews everywhere for this product are insanely amazing! i was so excited to try. everyone says it is fool-proof no smell. i disagree! it smells nice in the bottle but stinks like self tanner once applied. my husband hates st smell comments when i wear this so it is that noticeable. it has a super sticky consistency that stays on top of your skin for hours unless you use a tiny amount. a tiny amount gives so little color i did not notice a difference. i am always careful at applying but every time i have used it i have streaks down my shins on both legs! wtf? so i was hoping this would solve my issue with not having to dirty sheets w stinky self tanner but...i would almost rather have one stinky night with amazing color for- days w saint tropez than have to be stinky sticky everyday in order to get the color i desire. pros? i like that it is white has no color so you can apply it in the morning go. i do not like wearing smelly products to bed so being able to apply in morn is awesome. i will still fool around w using this to see if i can achieve better results.,neutral
left a white film over my skin. would not recommend for dark skin.,negative
i have noticed a difference in my skin after using this product! skin appears smooth and my complexion is bright. it gives a little tingle after applying which i love because it makes me feel like it is doing its thing!,positive
i have had the product for about a two months and i love it... i have acne scars and after a month of using this product my dark spots are slowly becoming lighter and it leaves my skin glowing.,positive
"i really love this product store it in the fridge for a little extra kick to combat dry eyes and puffiness. what i do not understand is why milk chose to make the.ozg tube so unnecessarily big. it is about the size of a roll-on deodorant. while the g size glides on easily under the eye, the g size is too big to really get under there so you just end up getting product along the lower ocular ridge and your cheekbones. i bought the larger size because it was the better deal, but turns out it is not because most of the product is being wasted nowhere near my eyes.i would suggest that if milk wants to make a perfect product, they should strongly consider lengthening the g size so it is more pen-like instead.",neutral
"as much as i wanted wanted!!! this cleanser n tatchas matching water cream to work, it did not. girl i splurged n spent about on both products in hopes that i was going to look like beyonce or something but nah i look like mona lisa with braille on my forehead. by the way my skin is oily n acne prone. i really tried to make it work. but in hindsight, it did a good job of removing all of my excess makeup that my makeup remover failed to remove. that is about it. also, this cleanser has fragrance my skin highly hates fragrance but this is on me because i just wanted to be boujee n ignore peoples reviews so i will take this l on this purchase.",negative
i do not get the hype sadly. it is wet and smells nice but i do not feel like it has changed anything or benefits my skin.,neutral
been using for months. varying between-x per week to none if i am busy. i bought this to get some control of the whiteheads on my t zone and cheek. reviewers have both said they are able to use this product and wash it off and nothing else but i find i fall into the bucket of having to still extract whiteheads afterwards which still makes my face bumpy. wish i could find something that really pulls the whiteheads out like the pore strips.,neutral
"i hate this stuff so much. i am such a fan of this brand, but no matter how hard i try, this stuff gets in my eyes. it costs my eyeballs and is so hard to rinse out. it is like washing your face with petroleum jelly!",negative
it caused me a horrible and painful breakout. i do not recommend this product for sensitive skin.,negative
it does not work for every type of acne. i cannot pinpoint when it worked. it does something...sometimes. i used the whole tube and will not repurchase.,negative
it did not work for me at all. went through half the bottle just to really give it a try and i had to repurchase my previous expensive product. which i had tried this since price was half of the other and i love this brand and the reviews were great. i would recommend this product because of the price and because i do believe products work differently on all skin types.,negative
"i love this! it makes my skin look amazing on its own or under makeup. the only thing i would note is that if you are going to wear it under makeup, definitely let it sink into the skin for- minutes because it can be a little slick. other than that i love this! the fragrance is not horrible but i could definitely do without it.",positive
"at first it was moisturizing my face really well, two weeks later my face felt dry with continued use.",negative
"wow. this is the first ever eye cream that has not irritated the crap out of my eyes!! no fragrance, which is a major plus. and the tint! omg, covers the dark circles amazingly. i have used it morning and night for a week or two now and am already noticing results. yay for niacinamide! i do not expect anything less from fab. highly recommend!",positive
"i like, i like a lot! i am surprised at how much i like this, how often i have been reaching for it and the difference i see in my skin when using it! i have a few of olehenriksens products as well as recommended and reviewed just as many and my main concern and usual dislike of many of them is the added fragranceperfume. while they may work for a little bit or at the beginning i have found that after a while it will irritate my skin.n-e-who let us get into this serum. i was skeptical to purchase at first because i am not a fan of the truth serum but this is nothing like that! it also does not have the added fragranceperfume added in the ingredients. it does have a light natural citrus orange scent which does not smell synthetic, it is not overpowering and you do not smell it once you apply it to your face.it is a thicker serum kind of gel texture and it is hydrating which is another plus for me because i am dry skin so i do not mind the some what sticky after feeling. it sinks in pretty quick and i can move on and apply my other serums. my skin look dewy and glowy after applying this. it does give a brightening effect and i love that!this did not clog my pores, break me out, because any irritation and it mixed well with my other skincare products.other than the hefty price tag i cannot see why this should not be added to ones skincare regimen. especially normal to dry skin and dull complexion in need of overall brightness and immediate glow.",positive
"should probably pass if you have oily skin...it is very moisturizing. there are a couple of things that are important i found out the hard way you have to shake the bottle well before using, and you need to let it dry down for at least min. before applying foundation. blurs pores, soft and silky, i wish i did not love it, but i am hooked.",positive
the formula is beautiful and has great spread ability. its almost airy and just glides onto the skin effortlessly! it is also good for sensitive skin. i took off one star because i have a medium to deep skin tone and it leaves a white cast on me. it is not as bad as other mineral formulas i have used but it is there. i suggest wearing foundation over it but then it is tricky to reapply later. you could use powder sunscreen to reapply also.,positive
"loved the texture and refreshing scent but i noticed that i get a small zit around eye area every time after using it. tried this a few times already so i had to stop using. i do have milia prone skin around eye area though, so maybe this was a bit too thick for me. i ended up giving to my mom and she loves it! did not break her out or anything.",neutral
"this product glides on easily once it has warmed up a little. that is really all i can say for it. using daily for a month and it has not changed my fine lines at all. it leaves my skin feeling slimy, not hydrated.",negative
"this does not remove my makeup off my face and i do not wear that much makeup. for reference, i typically just shade in my eye brows anastasia beverly hills perfect brow pencil and use mascara urban decay perversion. after using this to remove my makeup i look like a raccoon. i wanted to love this product but i am back to micellar water for makeup removal! does smell great!",neutral
"incredible!!! i have combo skin and use it every night in the end of skincare routine after de lalaretro moisturizer. my skin drinks it up and i wakeup with glowy supple skin, does not break me out. amazing after retinol. it is soo soothing and calming and the texture is out of this world, such a unique luxury experience unlike anything on the market. have not used it during summer yet though. will buy again and again, hooked forever!",positive
"this made me so orange! it was also extremely blotchy, which may have been my fault since i still have pretty dry winter skin. still, the color was so so orange--an issue i have never had with other tanning mousses. this is a pass for how expensive it is. the only positive things are the smell, and the fact that i had no color transfer on my sheets.",negative
"this is the first time i have bought this product. i was very excited to use it after reading great reviews. my skin is between oily and combination. i apply the product all over my face in the morning and night before applying my moisturizer. i have been using it for week. i have noticed my pores are smaller but my only complaint is that after applying, i am left with my face feeling flushed, red, hot and very tight. not sure if this is normal but due the amount of discomfort i am experiencing, i have decided to stop using this product",neutral
a friend recommended this moisturiser to me as i have a dry skin but after one use this lotion gave me breakouts and it is greasy and made my skin look awful. very disappointed with this product,negative

"i brought this product for the redness in my face and i honestly did not see a difference, it did feel nice on my face but that is too high of a price tag for something that just feels nice.",neutral
"had high hopes after seeing hyram recommending. i have been using this for a little over a month and there is no difference in my dark circles. i get that this may be a product where more use is needed to see results but what i cannot get over is the way this goops up! the glitter particles collect on the natural eye creases and no matter how little i use or how much i tap it in to my skin. the glitters are also a bit of a chunky mess, not the fine glitters you expect to diffuse or create the appearance of smoother under eyes. exaggerates my dark circles and fine lines. all of this and no reduction in my dark circles? nah.",negative
"it is ok. using it for around- weeks already, and do not see that it is doing anything other than really just creating that protective layer like it states in description. i do not feel the hydration benefits or any texturetone improvements at all. just a regular face cream. texture- rich, not oily which is good for t zoneeffect- skin feels hydrated, but not really nourishedyou just do not feel dry. no other effects noticed.i will not repurchase this product, but will still finish the bottle since it is a clean face cream, so will not do bad to my skin.",neutral
"unfortunately it did not work for me and it is too late to return. for the tanning part it was just fine as far as self tanners go. however, the after-smell was terrible. i smelled like sweaty feet no matter how many showers i took. the smell gotten less potent with washing away the tan.very disappointed.",negative

"i have used a few expensive lactic acid serums, and this one gives results that are almost as good at a ridiculously cheap price. it really helps to keep my skin clear and fades dark spotsacne scars over time.my one complaint is that the simplicity of the formula means i do not quite get the same luminous glow i see with more elaborate formulas. but this is still a great option when i am on a tight budget, and my sensitive, dry skin tolerates it really well. the percentage of lactic acid may be a bit high for a first-time user though!",positive
does not seem to control oil. goes on a bit greasy and feels heavy.,negative
love this product! lasted all day and made my skin look so smooth and even! i usually have trouble finding a good fair neutral shade but this was a perfect match. love that the coverage is flexible too.,positive
"meh, feels nice to apply but does not do much. it is creamy and tacky, but if it dries the application of concealer can be tricky. it is okay... i use the saint jane eye cream, omorovicza revitalizing eye cream and had high hopes for this but it just did not do much for me. i would say it might be nice for someone who is low maintenance and just needs an eye cream that is clean, but does not do much in terms of the benefits it describes.",neutral
i find that trying to rub product in it balls up on your skin. cannot even add a moisturizer on top. hsve to wash it off and start over.,negative
i really wanted to love this moisturizer but i just cannot get past the scent. it is quite strong and smells a bit dated like grandmas perfume. personally i prefer a fresh scent for my face products if any.,neutral
"this unfortunately gave me acne all over my chin and cheeks. it was gentle and scent free which was great, but the whiteheads were a lot.",negative
i received this product complementary to try out and was surprised. it provided the right amount of moisture and protection while leaving my skin with a nice sutil glow.,neutral

"i have had this product in my cart for well over a year and was ecstatic to finally pick it up since i absolutely love the strawberry and brown sugar mask and expected the same fragrance. however this product smelled a lot more chemically and while i am never affected by a products fragrance, this one turned my stomach. i actually really enjoyed the formulation, but will be returning as the smell is just way too plasticy and artificial.",neutral
"everyone who i have ever talked about this mask has said they love it, but unfortunately for me they did not warn me about the smell. it is extremely pungent! i really wanted to love this but the smell is not worth it. it smells like when you walk into a hookah bar and everyone has some different type of candyfruit flavored tobacco hitting you right in the nose. its so powerful. i really wanted to use it and see the benefits of the mask so i put some strong smelling essential oils next to my nose to cove the smell. and if i have to do that to be able to even wear a mask for minutes, its not worth it. if you think you can handle the smell then by all means go for it!!",negative
"i wanted to love this so much but unfortunately it just did not work out. i have hyperpigmentation from acne and this just made it look so much worse. it does not build up, and it does not cover either. it also did not last at all. even if i set it, it would transfer and get really patchy throughout the day.",negative
i originally used tatcha in the green container but gave this a try because i like that dewy look for makeup application. but i find the product is to greasy and i have to let it sit or i have to wipe off with a towel which is a waste otherwise i will look oily when i apply my makeup. i have sensitive acne prone skin has not caused breakouts. i have noticed small fine bumps but i use other products in my skincare regiment so cannot blame it on this product solely. when it is done i am going to try transitioning to drunk elephant as a moisturizer and their serum,neutral

odd textured cleanser that turns into a soft lather. thoroughly cleans and shrinks my pores!,positive

"no, just no. cheaper quality packaging- why get rid of the pump? and the formula is no where near as good as the old one. it is a watered down version and it does not have that luxurious, earthy spa-like scent anymore. now it smells like every other basic cleanser at the drugstore. so sad. i have not been able to find a cleanser as lovely as the old ceramic slip. i will not be purchasing sunday riley unless they bring the old formula back.",negative

"i received my water-lock moisturizer complimentary from tara harper skincare in exchange for my honest opinion. overall, i was happy with this moisturizer! some people disliked the strong scent, but i thought it was light with a distinct orange fragrance. it was not unpleasant or overwhelming to me. my skin did feel much more moisturized after using, and i found the formula to be creamy yet lightweight upon application. however, i did not really noticing much of a skin smoothing effect, which i was really hoping for. if there was any, it was minimal. it is a good moisturizer, but i was not left feeling blown away by it.the packaging, on the other hand, is pretty perfect. i love the design and think the packaging is beautiful and feels quality. i also really like that once you have the pump, you only need to purchase pod refills, reducing plastic waste since you are reusing the pump!",positive
"i really wanted to like this more. i like the plant-y smell. it really feels like it gets your skin clean. i love that it is a glass bottle. however, after about a week of use it just dries my skin too much. maybe if you have oilier skin it would work for you.",neutral

"quality-wise, this is an amazing product. it is a great oil cleanser for a double cleanse system, easy to rinse off. it is really cheap and you get a lot of product. so you are probably wondering why i give it a one star review. well one of the ingredients in this product is ascorbyl palmitate, which is an ingredient derived from palm oil. i am trying to avoid products that have palm-based ingredients, because the palm oil production industry contributes to deforestation and habitat destruction. so for the sake of being environmentally conscious, i will never buy this product again when i am done with it.",negative

not worth it. does not actually moisture my skin and leaves a rubber like texture on the face.,negative
"received a sample of this and tried this for a few nights. did not feel it was very effective. the oil does not get absorbed into your skin and i ended up getting small breakouts within the next few days which really annoyed me. if you are trying to control acne spots, acne fine lineswrinkles, choose a different retinol please!",negative
"i have really mixed feelings about this product. first off, i only use this in the evening and apply with my hands which has made the product last much longer than applying ampm and i would assume if using a cotton pad. it took my skin about four weeks to adjust which was frustrating as most of the reviews state their skin was glowing after the first use. i usually break out hormonally with cystic acne around my chin but this was pulling honking cysts from every which way. eventually they calmed down and now have yet to have a real cystic breakout even around my period week which is awesome. i can tell it has shrank my pores a bit but definitely has not cleared up my blackheads. they are still there on my nose but when i pick i know, bad i cannot seem to squeeze them out like usual. so the pores are tighter but still darkclogged, sigh. i have not noticed any brightening either. i suppose i could try bumping my usage to twice a day but because the acid content is quite high i just do not want to risk the sensitivity to the sun. oh, and it definitely leaves a sticky feeling on the skin which once i apply my face oil disappears but since i use a lighter moisturizer during the day i do not see that helping the stickiness much. overall, it is fine. probably will not repurchase when i finally run out. i guess you just have to try it to see which way it will go in your skin. for the price, it is not a bad experiment to try.",neutral

"i received this product free to review from topbox circle. i have very dry skin, and i usually have five steps of skincare into my routine. i really like this toner moisturizer combination. it was so quick and easy. when i do not have time for the whole five step routine this was perfect. my face felt really moisturized and i did not feel like i needed to add any more moisturizer if i did not want to. also, i have been spending a lot of time at the waterpark so this was perfect. i only had to apply this and my spf. and i was good for the whole day. the only throw back is my face felt sticky for a little while after applying it. but it did go away. also i found that i enjoyed putting it on with my fingers instead of a cotton pad. it made it feel less sticky with my fingers. i would definitely recommend this product.",positive
"i have never used a product that pills this badly, absolutely horrible. ended up with more pilled product in my hair than i had left on my face, which completely defeats the purpose of sunscreen and is super gross.",negative
"this moisturizer strikes the perfect balance of nourishing without feeling heavy, dewy without looking greasy, and effective without interfering with any of my other products. i can even layer it underneath sunscreen without pilling! i especially love using this before after applying my rx retinoid. it also works well as an eye cream! definitely a multi-tasking formula that is versatile in terms of who can use how to use.",positive
i got this as a christmas gift and i am about half way done. i am a big fan of farmacy brand and this lives up to its hype! i have not used any oil based cleanser since i do not really use make up but this removes flaky skin and i can feel the dirt come out as i massage my skin with it. i also love the scooper that comes with it in a separate top.,positive
"i tend to like face oils and they tend to work well with my skin as long as they are not comedogenic. i thought this was a particularly nice one. it smells wonderful, absorbs quickly, and did not seem to clog my pores. it also worked well under makeup. a very small amount goes a long way.",positive
"i have very sensitive skin after reading all the reviews i thought this would be a good product to try. no it gave me the worst acne ever, only used it twice and still have cystic acne when before i had no acne, be careful with this product and it was not my skin purging as some other reviewers have said.",negative
i did not see any change in my skinproduct does not work,negative
did not work at all. tried it for a whole month did nothing.,negative
"this works really well! a bit too strong for me though, but i have very sensitive skin. i suggest using just once a week to not over exfoliate your skin.",neutral
i have been using this serum for about weeks now i normally get a lot of pimples and acne but since i have started using this i have not seen a single pimple on my face. my dark spots have brightened up significantly and the scent is amazing.,positive
"this is definitely not the product for my skin i think my skin is too sensitive, and the burn while it is on my face is not worth the results. i am glad other people are having such good luck with the product!",neutral
"my skin reacts to everything. so much so that i still cannot find a daily moisturizing cream that does not make me breakout or sensitive. this, however, has helped so much! i use it with a vitamin c serum in the mornings. zero breakouts, clogged pores and i have got a great extra hydration boost for my morning! totally worth the money.",positive
does not work. i have hyperpigmentation and scaring. had high hopes,negative
"i use this to double cleanse. this is so good for my skin and it gets all the spf and makeup off my face. the downside is that if you use this around your eyes at all, your vision will be soooo blurry. i was careful too! also it smells a little odd but for the price i like this",neutral
"this is soooo expensive and i have noticed truly zero effects. my under eye dark circles are just as bad. i am young so do not have eye wrinkles, but this truly seems like a waste",negative
"i am not normally sensitive to smells, but i really hate the scent of this! it smells like a cleaning product, and not in the lemony sort of way that some products do. regardless, i still would not use this on my face, as it does not say it is non-comedogenic and it absolutely seems like it would break me out. it is not as greasy as other sunscreens, but it is definitely more greasy than a regular moisturizer, and it feels heavy on the skin. also this is literally just a sunscreen- for this price point, i would need a product that at least did more than one thing.",negative
i felt no difference in my skin and it left a sticky coating. did not feel like my skin was absorbing it. cute packaging but not worth it.,negative
"i really love this product, my face feels really soft and looks very glowing",positive
"i have been using the so is spray for about months now and absolutely love it so when the serum came out i could not wait to try it. i got to try it in exchange for my honest review and i am genuinely impressed. i have sensitive, acne prone skin that can get red and angry. i cut everything out of my skincare routine except for my cleanser, so is spray, so is serum, moisturizer and eye cream. it is been about three weeks and my skin has never looked or felt better. the so is serum goes on smooth and my skin literally soaks it up immediately. it does not leave behind a residue and my skin instantly looks less red and feels calm. over the past few weeks my skin has cleared up so much. my skin has not been reactive, sensitive, red or angry since i have been using the serum. it looks and feels amazing. i credit the so is spray and the so is serum for my skins drastic recovery. i would recommend both or at least the serum if you cannot get both to anyone with sensitive, acne prone, angry, red skin. you will not regret it!",positive
"broke me out, which made my skin worst due to me picking with the breakouts. i can say once the breakouts cleared a bit. i continued to use. i may have a week of this left to use. its not effective. i do not see any spots that appear to be lighter. i will continue to use to see if i see any other benefits. i received this product for my review from influenster. i enjoyed trying it due to the brand",neutral
"it is going to be a no. literally broke me out for months straight and did not know it was this product doing it to me!! stopped using it and my skin cleared up, side note i do not understand why we keep using hyro-acid in acne products...it is known to clog pores...but moving on, bad product",negative
"i think the product delivers in that it definitely helped smooth out my skin. however, i think my skin is just too drysensitive for daily use. each time i use it, there is a very brief sting, and it is a bit drying.",neutral
"ok, it smells a little weird, so i tend to use it at night- but it works! my skin looks bright and feels soft. absorbs easily and you can see it working- i always get a little glow when it first goes on!",positive
"this product is interesting. it is not a perfect, holy grail item. however, after reading the polarizing reviews and trying for myself, i do think this is a good item. my skin is sensitive and acne prone so i have only used this a handful of times. i am seeing some fading in my hyperpigmentation, but it is not magic. it does seem to take time and consistent use duh?. i will say, manage your expectations. this, alongside a good skincare routine will most likely improve your skin. i still have a ways to go til i see more progress. i am not ruling it out. also, the elephant in the room will be your skin. the scent seems to aim for floralnatural with an overwhelming dollop of sulphur. it is not as bad as everyone says and if you put it on before bed, it does not matter anyway.",neutral
"i have tried my fair share of cleansing oils and cleansing balms. i actually really used to love this cleansing balm given that it was cheaper than a lot of competitors products, but what i realized after trying others is that this balm does not cleanse as well and as fast as other cleansing balms. i find that i do have to work harder in massaging this product on my face to melt my waterproof makeup and there are still times that there is still mascara residue on my lashes. i always double cleanse when i use balms, so i do not have a lot to say in terms of the feeling after i wash off the balm. i always recommend going in after with a foamgel cleanser with any cleansing balmoil. the cleansing balm i would recommend over this is the drunk elephant one as i just find that it cleanses better for my waterproof mascara.i have had this taken away from me while traveling and it would apply to all cleansing balms. these large sizes can be taken away if not checked in as they considered it a liquid!",neutral
it is a great product but the pump broke really quickly. when i looked into it lots of other people had the same problem. it makes the bottle completely unusable and loads of product gets wasted. would not recommend it while it is still in this packaging.,neutral
strong unpleasant smell. leaves skin feeling a little sticky.,negative
"was excited but disappointed, no streaks was perfectly even but it was a little too orange for me, i felt too warm, i wish it was a little cooler, but with the same depth of shade",neutral
overpriced for the amount in the bottle. glow recipe has been slowly upping prices and reducing quantities of their products. i find this extremely tacky. i found a manmonde dupe for only compared to the abysmal amount i got with this.,negative
"i have been testing the brand new vitamin c lactic dewy deep cream from ddg for about weeks now and i am completely obsessed! this has become my favorite moisturizer! this ultra rich cream can be used day and night. it has vitamin c and lactic acid to enhance performance, deeply hydrate visibly transform dry, dull skin. i have seen great improvement in hydration, radiance, my lines are softer and more plump! i literally love this so much, it is so creamy absorbs great and leaves me so glowy and the hydration lasts it also has a very light cucumber scent that i love, it is a very light scent and it dissipates quickly. i also love the jar is oz instead of the typical.oz! it works well with other products in my routine and i have never experienced piling which is a must for me! i recommend this!",positive
"i have sensitive skin. i used this for about a month, day and night, but i think it broke me out and irritated my face. i think it is the essential oils, which i am sensitive to but did not think biossances products would irritate my face since i use everything else from them. would recommend if you do not have sensitive skin.",negative
"absolute junk. the packaging on this is a mess, as you can see it will get everywhere no matter how you store it. also, do not fly with this product because that also causes it to explode. on top of that it is not an effective sunscreen, wore it in florida last week and was outside for approximately minutes, my face was fried. fried. i have no issues with other sunscreen products, but this one does not work at all.",negative
"i was so excited about these, there is no way to see results because they put so few in the package. same with the peace out dark spots.",neutral
i have dry skin and this made it feel worse than when i use nothing at all. probably better for oily skin types.,negative
the product has one of the strongest and worst smelling perfumes i have experienced. the product itself is gritty and does not give that moisturizing feeling.,negative
"amazing. susan yara from yt recommended and what a game changer. i use this whenever i feel i need it. sometimes twice a week, sometimes not. either way a little goes a long way and you see the difference. my first aha and it worked way better than the salicylic acid and bha i was using. i did not break out, and i think it is because i only use this when i need to and slowly introduced it into my routine. great purchase! as someone that did not even wash my face for the first years and just learning that skincare is not a gimmick- this is definitely a chemical exfoliant you will not regret if you are a beginner like me. it does what four other products combined will do. invest in this first before buying other products.",positive
hydrating but makes my face itchy after use. i will be switching to a different fade oil.,negative
i am very sensitive to fragrance and so far an unknown ingredient. i just started wearing makeup in my mids so i do not wear too much. but this really makes make up come off so easily. it also does not drag or pull. i was using a different cleansing oil and it pulled. i did not like that. the scent of this balm is pleasant and light. it comes with a spatula so that you do not need to use your fingers to scoop the product.,positive
"my skin is very dry and this is a savior and must-have in my skincare routine. freshs rose collection is one of my favorites and oh my, that perfect scent!!. although i was initially astonished by the price for the size, i do think it is worth it. leaves my skin dewy and glowy- definitely keeps my hydrated all day long.",positive
"this sun screen is awesome. it definitely gives a glow. i will say it is very hydrating so i think it is better for dry skin. when it is first applied it looks greasy but it dries in seconds and gives a great glow. for those saying it causes dry patches, i think it is best to put on a moisturizer before hand regardless of the fact that it is already hydrating. recommend this sunscreen!",positive
it is a nice product but can be very drying. i have used other niacinamide serums but this has to be the most drying one. it does give a nice glow but as someone in their s i will use the remainder couple times of week to alleviate the dryness. i will not repurchase and will go back to my previous niacindide serum,neutral
i tried to really love this product but it kept on me. i love the shade color but it also is super over hyped,neutral
"i have only been using this product for a week, i already noticed that my skin is much brighter and my acne scar is a little bit lighter. i do not like the smell of this cream though, it is bearable.",positive
this product is great and i actually notice a difference of my under eyes looking brighter and lighter. better than other more expensive eye creams i have tried from sephora!,positive
"this is so fragranced it irritated my eyes. a nice scent, but far too powerful for a face wash! irritation aside, a pretty middle of the road cleanser. m",negative
"i wear fenty in eaze drop foundation. product does help with redness, but leaves darker skin tones ashy or grey. maybe only use to spot treat. also, product is oily and separates. still giving it a chance though.",neutral
i received this product free from influenster. the serum is pretty light and does not feel heavy which is one thing i like but i did not see myself overly impressed with the product especially because of the amount products out there in the market to help get rid of dark spots. yes it does work but based on the price i may go with something else a little cheaper that works just as good,neutral
they do not work. they also are very sticky and left a hicky like mark on my face.,negative
"really wanted to love this sunscreen, but unfortunately, it burns when i sweat or accidentally get it in my eyes. definitely gives a nice glow underneath makeup, but not worth the stinging. my skin did not like this one... not for sensitive skin. i much prefer their unseen sunscreen!",neutral
i have used other mandelic acids from other brands and i hate this one. i do not like that it is premixed with ha. the smell is lesser then normal mas because it is mixed therefore i do not know how much of each is actually in it. who knows if it is. the bottle does not say. with that being said i think it does not work as well as pure mas in other brands. it leaves a greasy feel on my face and just does not go on well. i am very familiar with skincare and if you do not have much money sure try it to start with but honestly if you have a few extra dollars try another brand that does not mix their products. i have never been a fan of this brand and this will likely be my last product i purchase from them. just not feeling they do anything positive for me personally.,negative
"smells horrible, had to return. i only used it for a week and a half, so i cannot say how effective it was. but it smelled so bad it made me gag. do not buy if you are sensitive to smells. it is a shame because i love olehenriksen products!",negative
i received the sample size of the serum and i was excited to try it but unfortunately there was not enough to get a full review but i can say that the texture is nice and it sinks into the skin fairly quickly. i do not like that it is fragrant but it does not have an unpleasant scent. so far so good.,neutral
"after years of searching and disappointment, i had finally come across this eye cream and i will never use another one again!! it is thick and moisturizing, but absorbs incredibly well and acts as a great base for under makeup. the fine lines under my eyes have diminished, and they even crease dramatically less with my concealer. totally worth the splurge!",positive
"while the mask is certainly soothing, cooling and hydrating i did not notice a plumping effect. that said it does deliver on all it other claims. the price point is fine for what it is but i do not think i loved the product enough to repurchase. i enjoyed it while it lasted.",neutral
best serum ever! staple in skincare..i have oily skin by the way. no breakouts!,positive
"very strong scent. if you are sensitive to strong scented products, stay away. did not notice any difference in my skin during use. did not find it moisturizing. it did not because breakouts or because any negative effects to my skin, but it did not help it either. if you happen to enjoy its scent it is something expensive to put on your face to feel luxurious with no additional benefits.",negative
i love it! so moisturizing and the under eye feel smooth after only one use!,positive
"i suffer from pcos and my tumultuous diet does not help either. however, a clean diet always makes everything externally work better. i received this oil as a sample and i was quite hesitant to purchase full size given the price point but i decided against my better judgement and bought it. it is not my holy grail oil or nothing like that but it is a welcomed change from the stuff i have been using. this did not because me to break out and it has greatly refined my face texture which if you have had or have acne, you know what i am talking about and that was quite a surprise. a little does go a long way and i promise you it works miracles when you sleep with it. i am not into makeup like that but i have found myself wanting to use makeup because of the scars and hyperpigmentation.... gee thanks zits! this oil works well under makeup if you really give it time to soak into your skin. i currently am on because for my acne and it has greatly improved my skin in addition to the use of this oil. i recommend this oil or better yet, try the sample size. i am yet to see what benefits it brings but i am liking it so far",positive
"i am sure this product gave me some reaction around my eyes as it is the only change i had in routine and then have had a bad reaction for a couple of days. normally i would love to rate this brand high given price point, but i am certain its not for ultra-sensitive skiin like mine.",neutral
"i use almost every sunday riley product. this is my least favorite. it is quite oily. it is not like a light oil like ceo glow or luna. it is very heavy. perhaps it will be better for those with dry skin. i really have not noticed a huge difference with it either. it is basically okay. it is nothing special, nothing horrible. i will not be repurchasing this one. very mediocre unfortunately.",neutral
"does exactly what a good foaming cleanser should do. give you that really clean feeling but does not strip your face of moisture and you skin is so soft after using. i have paired it with the honey mask, honey halo cream and honey grail oil and it all works so good together. truly a god send for dry skin!",positive
"it does not irritate my face, a bit drying but the smell is what gives the rating for me. i understand it is natural but it is not what i enjoy first thing in the morning.",negative
"while i absolutely love the product and it has done wonders for my dry winter skin, the refill packaging, while great in theory, is terrible. it does not fit properly in the original container and squeezed out the sides when i was trying to screw on the lid. i ended up having to throw away the original push pump too, which is supposed to keep the product sanitary, and had to just cover the tub with the top lid and scoop out the product manually. also, once the product was getting empty, i realized the refill capsule only had half the amount of product as it appears from the outside. there is a false bottom halfway up the container. while i love the cream, i would never purchase the refill again and would be forced to buy the original tub, which defeats the purpose of the sustainable packaging. and for the price, it is very disappointing that the packaging makes it appear you are getting much more product than you are in reality.",neutral
great product but i am giving this a star because when i finally opened it all excited to use this and it was a quarter almost halfway missing.. for this price i expect it to be to the rim.,neutral
"this product feels more like a primer. it goes on smoothly and has a very pleasant scent. it does not feel incredibly hydrating, and i have not noticed any long term changes in my eye wrinkles. it does appear to make the skin smoother temporarily when you first apply it, which may help for concealer application. i would not repurchase this product.",neutral
"i was looking for an alternative to my aestheticians mandelic acid serum. this product is good and the price point is great, however my skin is already used to the higher concentration of mandelic acid found in professional products.",neutral
"so i bought this product from herbivore the moment it became available but then repurchased from sephora points, duh but i will never be able to live without this stuff. i was so eager for the product but my anticipation paid off because this oil is amazing. my skin feels softer, my skin is clearer i have dry skin but with breakouts-obnoxious and every oil i run through the cosdna website to make sure it does not have acne causing ingredients and none of them do! as soon as my last bottle started running low i had to re-up because i officially cannot live without this stuff. yes, it does smell like weed but if that is a problem for you, i cannot help you. it smells like weed because they have cbd and do not add any unnatural fragrances and i would rather my product not have artificial fragrance and chemicals. this oil absorbs super quickly and so far has helped with acne, dryness and redness. also a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts a heck of a lot longer than you might think. seriously the best stuff, i do not know i will ever be able to live without it!",positive
"this toner came highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. i was looking for a toner that provided exfoliation and helped with dark acne scares, so far so good! this makes my skin glow and i noticed my makeup goes on a lot smoother.",positive
i waited until i had used the product for a few days. i bought this product because i adore marianna hewitt. she is very transparent and i would buy anything she recommends to have her beautiful skin. so i was so happy to see she was launching this company. the face mask is so different than those out there. it is hydrating and gives the skin a lit from within look. i do notice if i use a heavier layer i notice i need to wipe it off a bit more and i have flakes of skin from the exfoliating already ordered more so i do not run out. those mentioning that their skin was piling it is suppose to do that and not a product flaw! to those that comment on the packaging i think they nailed it. they are bloggers who made a photogenic tube that will not roll around or have to try and get the best angle. plus the color is beautiful. seriously cannot wait to see what else they release!!!,positive
"i recently ordered this product off of advice from a skincare specialist. at first i did not notice anything huge, but after only four days my skin was very smooth and hydrated. i would highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin! i struggled with dry skin and wanted to be able to moisturize my face without having it feel oily and that exactly what this product did! although i will say the bottle is quite small, only as big as a mans thumb so just know that before purchasing. other than that i am very happy with my order!",positive
as much as i believe in all the hype. every time i use this i get red blotches in my eyes. i do not even wash my eyes with it and it still does it. i tried and it happened on different occasions just to be sure. i was really trying to benefit from the cleanser but this one i cannot.,negative
"purchased this product because i wanted a cleansing oil with ease of using a pump instead of a balm. i only use waterproof mascara so definitely need an oil based cleanser to use around the eye area which is obviously not recommended on the bottle. while the product did remove all of my makeup, this stuff stings more than the typical cleanser in the eyes. i have used other oil cleansers on the eyes and they do not typically sting my eyes. i use the sephora waterproof eye makeup remover regularly as well, which has never burned my eyes, but this stuff stings!! had to return because i could not use for my intended purpose.",neutral
"i love this product, the first time using it i immediately notice the difference around my eyes looking firmer, gives it that youthful look i am looking for. worth the purchase",positive
hyped product that does not deliver.,negative
amazing!!!! best cleansing balm ever. seriously melts away makeup so effortlessly. i use a gel cleanser after wards and my skin feels so clean and it truly gets all my makeup off. i am obsessed. i bought the small size to try but i will for sure be getting the bigger size next time!! and it has such a nice smell.,positive
no color whatsoever on my face applied two days straight also,negative
this is the second bottle i have bought and i absolutely love it!! i have tried a lot of serums and this one hits it out of the park every time.,positive
"i love this moisturizer! it is perfect for the summer, and it leaves my face looking nice and smooth. i took this moisturizer on my recent vacation to dubai, and with the super hot temperature, it did not turn oily nor did it dry my skin out. will definitely continue to repurchase this item.",positive
"this has really helped my surface redness, i get red after my acid treatments. my only complaint is that it pills up under makeup so i can only use this at night. but it is so reasonably priced and it does work so i am okay with having to use in the evening.",positive
"unfortunately, this almost, how do i describe it, went bad after like months. it was good at first and leaves absolutely no white cast on the skin which i really like. however, after like months it broke me out because it was like it experied or something. i also wanted to note that it smells citrusy if that helps anyone when making a decision.",negative
this cleansing balm is not as spreadable as the kbeauty ones. i find that it does not remove makeup as thoroughly either. i followed with a cotton pad with toner and still saw makeup residue. this would be okay as a morning gentle cleanser but not as a end of day makeup remover cleanser.,negative
"i bought this after trying it on in store and being impressed by the glow and moisture it imparted to my skin. i love good genes and i use the ceo cream in the summer. they work magnificently so i was excited to have a cold weather option. after a week of use, my skin was plump and hydrated, but then i woke up one morning full of non whitehead bumps under the skin! it was a rash all over my face and near my eyes. it never itched but the bumps were obvious and ice is the only new product i have used in weeks. i am not sure what is in the product that triggers this reaction but i am incredibly disappointed that i can no longer use it. back it goes.",negative
"i was very excited about this product and since i am a huge algenist fan plus all the the rave reviews it was a no brainer to buy it. sadly it broke me out after about the second night- small little bumps all over my forehead i have oily skin and prone to acne but if i use a product that is drying like most acne products my skin starts to dry out and get flakey..so finding a product is difficult and requires a fine balance to say the least! my impression first night i used this i could get over how light and silt the texture of the cream was. i only used a small amount, melted it into my fingers then on to my face. it applied beautifully. i woke up and noticed my skin was softer and felt smooth but my forehead was more on the oily side. whatever- maybe my skin has to get used to it. next two nights same routine- but every morning the little acne bumps multiplied and were more pronounced. i stopped using it for a couple days and they did not settle until i bought a glycolic acid serum and used for several days on my forehead. only a week later had the acne bumps cleared up. the product feels luxurious and beautiful goes on smoothly and absorbs when you initially put it on but by morning it felt more greasy and almost oil like on the skin. i think the greasiness can suffocate the pores, hence the breakouts. i think if you do not have acne prone skin, this may be a great cream- but it certainly did not work for my skin! rather than buy a jar of it wasteful on both ends it is better to ask for a sample. you only need a small amount and the sample should last for a few days thereby judging if your skin can handle it!",neutral
i immediately smelled all of the fragrance that was in this mask and it started going into my mouth while i waited for minutes. my face did seem more plump and hydrated however after an hour or so i started noticing red bumps. my face remained red for the rest of the day and night.,negative
very very oily- and when it sits too long the first squeeze is all oil. also leaves residue on the face- but takes makeup off. so i am not sure if i would buy again!,neutral
"i received a sample of clarins double eye serum in exchange of my honest review from influenster.first i got almost a week worth of sample so i cannot be a good judge on this product true effects, specially since in case of an eye serum you need at least week of consistent use to see some visible improvements. so please keep in mind that i just used this product for a week. first the texture is brilliant smooth and definitely not sticky and truly what you expect from a serum more liquid than gel. what i did expect to show up even after one time use, to see reducing puffiness and it does not help me with that, i will say out of. i specially wore this at a night with full puffiness in my eyes and i woke up to the same puffs! hydrating wise though it does a fair job, i noticed though that using the serum without my eye cream does not leave me with the desired hydration that i expected, out of. in regards of dark circles i cannot really comment other than on few days i had better and brighter under eye comparing to others but it was random. and in the highlights it mentions that it is good for dryness i believe it is, in general if you consistently use it base on the texture i say give you smooth skin. but in overall considering its price i would not invest in this eye serum, it does a fair job but i could find just as good as a serum for better price.",neutral
"the adavanced repair made my skin look radiant and healthy. my initial thoughts of the serum was weird scent but manageable. i would definitely add this to my skincare routine! after using your-day sample, i saw results in the way my skin felt. especially waking up the next morning. influenster sent me this product free to test.",positive
best eye cream. it is like silk and makes underneath the eyes so smooth with continuous use.,positive
"this product is nice and produces a very rich lather with little product needed. however, this product has a very strong fragrance scent to it, which can be irritating to sensitive skin. i probably would not pay retail for this product.",positive
stays white on your skin and does not blend in thoroughly for a while. did not do wonders for acne. on the plus side it is good for sensitive skin.,neutral
smells great but clogged my pores. almost felt like it sat on top of my skin and did not absorb. it also caused my makeup to smear. i have only used it for weeks and it feels like a waste to throw it out.,negative
"i am definitely happy using my shani darden retinol reform, it is absolutely amazing. it does absorb good into my skin without over dying it. i like the texture and that it is lightly scented. i did see my forehead fine lines less noticeable, i will continue to use and highly recommend to everyone to try.",positive
my bf got me this as a gift. i love the jar. super cute sitting on my vanity. i really enjoy the effect from this cream on days when my skin is not dry or sensitive. it is not suitable for me to use every day and will burn if i have any dryness or sensitivity. i have worn foundation over this without issues. i only bounce a sponge for foundation application.,neutral
"feels good, smells great and healthy, keeps working hours after you apply it, wonderful ingredients, only the price is a bi too high",neutral
"i really enjoy this sunscreen! no white cast, does not because any breakouts, and it goes on smooth. i will say, it has a strong sunscreen smell but that does not last the whole day. i also would not recommend for skin that is on the oily side. i lean more towards dry skin but find this to be pretty oily even for myself. i do not mind because it leaves a dewy look which for me is preferable but something to keep in mind. overall, i will be repurchasing!",positive
this product is a bit hyped up in my opinion. it is quite thick and i felt like the hydration level was medium. i personally would stick with other products and moisturizers for hydration. it does smell nice though.,neutral
"this is the first time i used a self tanner and found this super easy! i also bought then accompanying mitt and worked very well. the colour is a nice golden glow, the perfect amount of warmth. i did dock a star because it smells kind of funny, not intolerable but could be nicer, maybe this is the smell of self tanner? overall its great will be repurchasing!",positive
"pros- pump is easy to use and convenient- moisturizing but not greasy- no white cast on my light skincons- pillled slightly when applied over my skincare products- caused some small pimplesi would only recommend this sunscreen if you do not plan on using many skincare products underneath it, and do not have acne prone skin.",neutral
"just started using this product, but as mary poppins would say, it is practically perfect in every way. feels light but also moisturizing and refreshing going on my skin and it is a clean moisturizer! it does not feel waxy or oily like other clean moisturizers. i also love that it comes in a smaller, more affordable size. the one drawback is the cost, but for now, i am a believer and i am willing to she will out a bit more for such a fabulous face cream.",positive
does not strip away my skin that much but i feel like with this it does not clean my face the way i like it? i think it is personal preference but still this is perfect for oily or combination skin. it does not go overboard and is just right for sensitive skin. i would recommend this to those with sensitive skin.,positive
"i was a little confused receiving this product. it is marketed as a lotion but of course, it is actually a toner? not sure how to utilize or reap the benefits of this product. i have tried it as both a lotion for my face, and also a toner and i have not noticed too much of a difference. not sure i am a fan of this one but will keep you posted when i get more use from it. if anyone can recommend a way to use this, i will be very grateful! received this as part of a vox box with influenster.",negative
finish was super oily and greasyapplication experience was so easy and wanted to love this sunscreen stick but just not good finish on my oily combination skin,neutral
"this is my first product from sulwhasoo and i think i was just expecting a little more. this is a very nice serum. it has more of a watery consistency and it is dark brown and gives me fermented vibes. it does not have any artificial fragrance that i can tell and smells kind of sweetsour again, kind of fermented? i do not know before fading quickly. due to its consistency it absorbs incredibly quickly into the skin. if you layer your serums, this is definitely one of the first ones you should apply. after i applied this, i did not really notice much of an immediate difference, to be honest. visually, it looked like i had not applied anything at all, and although my face felt kind of hydrated, i did not notice anything too dramatic. i was hoping this would be more impactful, especially since sulwhasoo is so influential in the kbeauty market and the product is so pricey. unfortunately i was left underwhelmed.",negative
i received this product as a complimentary to try at home. i was excited to try it since i have heard nothing but good things about this brand. but once i tired it i was not happy about it. i did not like the jelly texture and i had to pump a lot to my cotton round to get it on my face.,neutral
"omg it smells so bad, like someone lit a pair of sneakers on fire. i have yet to see if it works as i git it as a sample but the smell along is putrid.",negative
"bloated worse for days, and this is while trying to eat in smaller quantities. i had to resort to laxative to get rid of the bloat and constipation. i realize the bloating existed prior to using flatter me. and i also realize it is not a weight loss pill. i was just hoping it would help get my gut in check. hum has a new gut product not sold here so i may give it a try. just really tired of not being able to function normally when my entire closet depends on bloating and my entire day must be planned around a bathroom. next!",negative
"i do not know if it is actually doing anything? like, it feels really nice going on, but am i noticing any difference in my skin? i do not know. i am giving it the benefit of the doubt because i love dermalogica, and i will continue to use, but as of now, not anything i would rush out to get.",neutral
"interesting blue color. the smell is awful. omg. i do not look forward to using it because of the smell. it is ok in hydration, i do not see a difference in fine lines. i think it is a hassle to return things, so i am going to continue using it, but i will not purchase this again. if you are sensitive to smells, do not get this.",neutral
i love yttp and use a number of their products religiously but i honestly feel pretty neutral about this serum. it definitely brightens my face and feels refreshing at first but i am not crazy about the way it applies- it is sort of sticky.,neutral
"glow recipe hit it out of the park with this one. this product makes my skin feel so hydrated paired with the plum plump serum, it is an amazing duo! i love the beautiful packaging the fact that it is refillable! this is a perfectly light formula, that absorbs quickly into the skin, but still leaves an amazing amount of hydration on my skin. a definite recommend!",positive
"i have seen so many good reviews about this stuff and i really wanted to try a cleansing balm. because it is supposed to be better for your skin than normal cleansing washes. this ones affordable and has great reviews. when i got it, i was super excited. when it comes out it is almost like a vaseline weird smell. which it is not bad i still wanted to try it put it on my face follow the directions could not get it off like it took me forever to get this stuff off my face and then it left some behind and it says to get it all off i do not know if i like it honestly. i have only used it a couple times so far not that thrilled i do not know what benefits it is supposed to have for my skin i did not notice anything different my skin still felt dry if anybody has any details or something i am not doing right you can let me know.",neutral
"they are not kidding when they say gentle. i never felt that new product sting when applied to my skin. it is supper light, and silky with a pleasant mild scent. i apply the superfood air-whip moisturizer right after and my skin feels bright, fresh and smooth. you could not ever tell you have just used an exfoliator. if you have sensitive skin, then this is perfect for you!",positive
this is a great moisturizer that keeps your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. it was easy to add to my skincare routine. definitely worth a try.,positive

"read such great reviews but this broke my forehead out reallllllyyy badly and i never ever breakout like this in my life, tons of white heads and it took my skin about months to go completely back to normal. i had a similar issue almost happen with another cleansing balm but i caught it before it broke out again. maybe my skin does not like whatever ingredients are in cleansing balms. i did not love the smell that much either.",negative
"this is a nice toner. my pores blackheads are visibly reduced and smoothed. does not do much for my actual blemishes, though. i like that it does not make my skin feel sticky like most toners do.",positive
did nothing for puffiness or dark circles. it is a bit hydrating. i am a yo hispanic male. would not recommend,negative
"pills terribly, never dries. could not layer it for the life of me.",negative
"i am so glad it works to well for most people! did not work well for me. i have combination skin, with an oily t-zone. this clogged up my pores and left blemishes that i did not have before i used it. took a few days to get my skin back to normal.",negative
disliked scent. from dior i was expecting higher quality. not worth the.,neutral
"i have bought this sunscreen x! no white cast, nice smell goes perfect under makeup, most affordable at sephora as well",positive
"i love how thick this serum is, and i love how it feels on my skin. it is so smooth and creamy. it is my skin so much hydration with a nice glow. and it for sure has softened my fine lines. i also really love the packaging and the dispenser.",positive
"meh. i do not like how runny it is, and that i need to use another moisturizer on top of it. i probably will not buy another after my current bottle has run out.",neutral
"i could not find myself to use it more than three times. this product stinks horribly, like i am putting bug spray on my face. they should really look into changing the scent...i received this product as a free product for testingreviewing purposes",negative
"no! i had a sample, loved it. i rarely pay much attention to skincare samples because samples do not provide enough product to assess performance. but i liked it is feel, thought it had potential, bought full size, aside from the fact it appears useless, you can barely even use it due to extremely poorly designed delivery system. it is too thick for its dropper, poorly designed bottle for poorly performing product.",negative
i love this product my skin looks great. is expensive but it lasts long,positive
"ehh... it is okay. not horrible, not great, so not worth the price! it smells nice and fresh, is not much for foaming which i am fine with, but since covid i do not wear foundation, just concealer and eye makeup and i never feel like it gets everything off. and there is always schmutz on my cotton rounds after i tone, like my face was not clean. i never had that with my previous but discontinued cleanser.",negative
this product is not very moisturizing and there is a bit sticky of an after effect. it is a decent affordable moisturizer but would not recommend for people with dryer skin.,neutral
"i have many peels across price ranges and for the price and results, i expected more. my skin did improve but it took much longer compared to my the ordinary peel. my mother who also used the peel loved it and it reduced fine lines on her. i would recommend this to mature skin.",neutral
"prior to using this, i did not have much bumps and only used as a spot treatment for bumps on my forehead. about a month into using it, i developed tons of small bumps on my forehead- something that has never happened to me before. also, i noticed that once i put this product on, it made my skin look and feel very greasy even if i put it on immediately after washing my face. i also never suffered from oily skin prior to this. it seemed to change my skin completely!",negative
"i like how it feels when applied. the packaging is super cute, as expected of the brand. i love that it has retinol and squalane, and i am excited to see the future results! i am but i wanted to start retinol now to help with prevention.",positive
"feels amazing, so refreshing. wish it would mist a tad longer but it is great! smells v fresh!",positive
horrible. hard to use treatment does not rub into your skin. leaves a film on.,negative
"it smells nice. it has a nice jelly-like texture. for those with less sensitive skin, i am sure it will be fine. it is a shame because it cleans decently well and has a light soothing fragrance--it does not smell like blueberries by the way. it is more of a floral scent. i would recommend it only for people who are not sensitive to fragranceartificial or essential oils or ahas. if you have sensitive skin, please stay away.",neutral
does the job but nothing special. i do not think i will buy it again just because i really do not see much change. good mask that hydrates my face but i think there is a lot of alternatives that can do just the same.,neutral
this does help with my dark circles but it also exaggerated all of my fine lines around my eyes which made me look significantly older. i am years old and i have very good skin and i want to keep it that way.,negative
"i personally am not sure why this is rated so highly. i purchased this product because of the hype, and i was very disappointed. the best thing about it is the smell, it smells really good! it is a very watery consistency and i did not find it to be very moisturizing. i even tried using it before using my foundation and it made my face very oily. i wanted to love it, i really did but unfortunately this product was not for me it is also a little pricey for the quality of this product.",negative
"i am very particular and sensitive to smell and texture of creams and this cream definitely did not disappoint. smells refreshing, smooth texture, but most important is how brought my dull skin back to life after a few weeks! skin feels firmer, glowing, and subtle!",positive
"it definitely does it is job with removing your makeup sunscreen and nourishing your dry skin with the oat ingredient. which is very comforting and softening on your skin. i wear contact lenses and for some reason when i rinse off this cleansing balm from my face, the rinse mixed with cleansing balm will stain my contact lenses when removing it from my face. it is a good price though, i just recommend taking your contact lenses out first and then wash your face with this or else the balm will leave a hard to clean residue on your contact lenses",neutral
"at first i thought i loved this stuff. feels so silky and smooth after rinsing off. but after using for two weeks i started getting worse and worse bumps, clogged pores, and raw cheeks.",negative
does not remove make up as well as id like and the smell is just too overpowering. will switch back to my previous cleanser,negative
"to remove my makeup, i begin by using this, rub it in and let it penetrate for a few minutes. theni rinse a little bit but the oily film does not come off and the makeup is still on. next, i use micellar on a cotton pad to remove everything. final step rinse, serum and moisturiser. as a stand-alone, this does not work for me. would i buy it again? perhaps but i would not be afraid to try alternative products.",neutral
"i am totally clueless as to how this product has such high ratings and even won an allure award. i got a sample of this in my sephora play box. it most certainly does not remove my makeup. it makes a muddy mess of my eye makeup, which then gets into my eyes and my contact lenses. i just honestly do not understand how so many people are having success with this product! it is terrible! i am going to throw away what is left in the jar and be done with it. all i need is my makeup wipes with micellar cleanser, that remove my makeup instead of making a muddy mess of it and leaving it on my face and in my eyes!",negative
i wish i could write something great about this product but unfortunately i cannot. so i brought this from sephora favorites bedtime products. irritated my whole face i turned red itchy. i completely removed it with just water and try ice to calm down and nothing.,negative
"i received this product in a sample trial sized. i put off using it until i finished my de c-firma serum which did not provide me with any noticeable results. once i started using this i noticed results within a couple of days. i have extremely dry skin with acne scars. this serum is so moisturizing, you feel like your skin is hydrated from the moment you apply it. i also noticed that my acne scars have improved and my overall complexion is glowing since i began using this. i have seen other reviews stating they broke out from this serum, i also have sensitive breakout prone skin, and did not have any issues with it. everyone is skin and reaction to products is different. for me, this product was a win.",positive
just an okay cleanser... does not do much and i personally do not think it is worth the money,negative
i love this product. i have been negligent in my skin care for a number of years. i picked this and my step a few days ago and my skin is quickly returning to a healthy states. i had not had a zit i years but i guess i guess if you have layers of dead skin on your face it hard for oil to get through. so my face is once again producing oil which is good because oily skin will not wrinkle as fast as drier skin. i need the extra exfoliations to get rid of the build up and make products such as serum and toners penetrate the living skin and make them more effective.,positive
please bring back the old formula whyyyyyy did you change it. makes no sense it was perfect for everyone. why not just add this new one and keep old one.,negative
"i was surprised at how well this cleanser removed all of my make up. it is a great bang for your buck, and easy to transport to another container for travel. love that it is truly a two-in-one product cleanser and make up remover. it feels so comfortable on my dry skin",positive
"i like tatcha products however, i am having a hard time with this eye cream. the texture is so hard to take out i had to dig my nails into the jar to get some eye cream out. once i was able to get it out, there are only a small amount that i could get out. now it looks like an white ointment that has been sitting there for awhile. i am too used to creamy or gel like eye cream. i might need to get a little scoop to get the cream out.",negative
"great for daily use. lightweight, not sticky or tacky. feels good on skin and hydrates. does not irritate my sensitive skin.",positive
"i have generally really liked the youth to the people products. i liked the texture of the tge vitmin ccaffeine energy serum as it was not too runny and the scent was neutral. however, i found that it left my skin sticky and my foundation did not apply as smoothly as normal.",negative
"so i bought the mini size because i saw mixed reviews, i am glad i bought the mini size because i am not a fan of it. i love that is it is a powder and with water it turns in paste but unlike other exfoliators, this one just feels like sand. i do not feel a difference at all in my skin. i have oilycombo sensitive skin just for reference. if you do want to try it i would recommend the mini size.",neutral
i got this product to try out for free via influenster. it was not bad but it broke me out sadly.,neutral
"i am giving this stars because it is not moisturizing for my dry skin. it sits on top of my skin my skin feels dry underneath and it feels like the moisturizer is just sitting on top, even if i use a hyaluronic acid underneath. i am using it up on my body, and i will not be repurchasing.",negative
definitely have been loving this for the summer so far. i usually wear it with no makeup but it also works just as fine under makeup. i wanted this to cover up some redness around my nose and cheeks and it has been working lovely. i also love it for the spf. i mean what else if there to ask for?,positive
"i use this in my foundation and it gives a very beautiful luminous and dewy finish. i would not recommend you use this for your hair because it really made my hair stink and sticky. i have never tried it on my face directly just by itself, to be honest. overall i just do not think this products worth the money and honestly quite regret purchasing it.",negative
"i received a deluxe sample of this in the play! all stars last week. the essence is nice, and it perhaps has allowed my regular nightly skin care and exfoliants to sink down a little deeper than they normally would. i have not experienced any immediate, wowing results.but... there are definitely other essences that do the same job for way, way less money. great skin need not be this expensive.",neutral
"i received this product complimentary from laneige and although i usually love their products, this one was kind of a miss for me. first, the mist could stand to be a little more fine. also, although it left my skin hydrated, it also left a sticky feel that stayed the whole day! the only way to get rid of the stickiness was to apply full on makeup. it did work really well under makeup. i have to say, without makeup, even though it was sticky, my skin looked lovely!",neutral
"oh. my. gawd. this product is pretty magical. i am nearly and i have a relatively deep wrinkle between my eyebrows, but the anti-wrinkle patches have lessened the appearance of the line and, over time, i have slowed down to saving them for weekly-ish maintenance and definitely perfect for a special occasion the initial appearance post-removal is astonishingly flattened and smoothed. the only buzzkill is that there are not more strips per box, but gurl, this is still definitely worth your time.",positive
love the product but do not order online. it leaked all over the bag twice. almost half of the product had leaked out.,neutral
it is a nice japanese product for a face. i got it as a product to try and review. it has almost no scent. easy to use. in a longer run can make your face look more nourished and make it look younger.,neutral
"skip on this, it peels like crazy and i tried giving it many chances after a week of different methods anything i did the peeling was there it had its cute moments especially with the gorgeous finish old you get it to not peel lol but for the price nah i rather exchange it for something else",negative
"i have not tried the product yet, but the packaging was extremely messy. the product had spilled and got on multiple other products i had purchased. cannot say that i do not like the product itself though because i have not tried it yet.",neutral
"at first i thought this product would be gimmicky, but since i have all of the other glow recipe items i decided to purchase this one as well. it is now one of my favorite products! its extremely versatile i use it to wet my brushes, hydrate my skin, or give my face a nice glow after my makeup routine. it is also super long lasting! i use this spray multiple times throughout my makeup and skincare routine and i have not had to buy another one since buying this one months ago! the spray nozzle is well designed and distributes the product great. i will definitely be repurchasing this once i run out!",positive
to be honest i hate this moisturizer. i do not like the texture or the smell or the container. save your money seriously. there are so many better products out there. it is not bad. but it is not great. or anything special. i have a lot of moisturizers and i love to mix things up but i never ever like to use this one. i find this brand extremely overpriced for what it does.,negative
"amazing!! love this serum. really helped with fine lines and wrinkles. i used it every night before bed after washing my face. i received it from bzzagent to try, but to be honest i do not think it is worth the price tag. i do not see a huge difference. i may need to use it a little longer to see results i do not know.",neutral
"i have always had these little bumps that eould appear on my cheeks every now again. i have tried lactic acid treatments, ahas, tons of different moisturizers. but nothing would ever seem to get rid of them. i used this one time, and when i woke up my skin was smooth. all the little bumps were mostly gone. i am prettt impressed.",positive
awful. patchy and orange. do not waste your money.,negative
i love supergoop! and been a very loyal customer to them. when i heard about this product launch i could not wait. it was too good to be true that they were now adding vita-c to my favorite brand. the disappointment was receiving oz ml. my fault for not reading carefully. for the price and how much you would have to use daily to get the spf the bottle would only last a few days if even a week. the product takes over an hour to sink in and still leaves a sparkle not glitter to the face. sadly i am returning and sticking to their unseen sunscreen for the face their setting spray to reapply over my makeup.,neutral
"i was excited to try the product when it arrived, but was truly disappointed based on all the positive reviews other people provided. smells nice and did not irritate my skin, but did not remove my makeup. so-so product if you do not wear any or very little makeup and only use it to cleanse your face. if you have other products that work and you like them, stick with those and save your for other items.",negative
i can see a visible change every time i use this but it smells like nair.,neutral
the lavender smell makes me relax like i just got out of the spa. this moisturizer is a little bit heavy but it is a balm so it has a lot of moisture throughout day and night. my skin feels very soft and looks healthy. i think this is a perfect winter moisturizer when my skin is very dry.,positive
i recommend this product. perfect for acne and oily skin,positive
so bad! it irritates my skin.--. i was so disappointed i could not return it!,negative
i really wanted to like this product due to the raving reviews about it. the packaging and smell and menthol feeling was nice. but unfortunately this cleanser dries out my skin and does not feel like it cleanses my skin that well. i would say it is a very light cleanse.,neutral
"i usually do not write reviews, but i was so excited to try this and so let down on the product that i really had to this time. i have dry skin so i thought this was going to be a miracle product, but every time i put it on it dries my skin even more. i have tried it as a normal mask and also overnight and overnight is the worse! i wake up and my skin is tight and scaly, maybe this will work on someone with oilier skin but i thought the whole point of it was quench your skin. probably giving it away to someone and will never repurchase.",negative
"i got this j lo beauty hit single gel cream cleanser from influenster and jlo beauty for an honest review. i am happy to receive the cleanser, the gold color tube is pretty and looks neat. i used it everyday at shower, it feels gentle on my skin, i massaged the cream with my finger. i feel clean and fresh afterwards, and my face does not feel dry after shower. it does feel luxury, and i am interested to try other products of jlo beauty.",positive

"i ordered this because i have heard good things about this brand that products are straight forward with their ingredient content. the directions said to not exceed minutes and i did like- minutes because i was distracted, regretfully. it was hard to fall asleep after especially after using paulas choice toner. now days after... hollllllyyy moly my face is peeling and it burns when i try to moisturize. my big mistake. if you have dry sensitive skin like me, be careful with this. do it for minutes",neutral
"it made me break out, dry out, and show signs of texture",negative
"i love the serum the scent, texture, ingredients but the of the container is glass and it gives you the illusion that there is still some serum left in the bottle. at the first, i thought the tube of the pump is a bit short so i cannot get to the product on the bottom. i did not realize till i took the pump out and shake it upside down and still nothing comes out of the bottle. it is just supper thick glass bottom looks like there is more product in there. that was definitely not the amount of product worth.",negative
"makes my skin look a lot better, i got a sample size i was loving so i bought the full size. it could be that i started a prescription retinoid using it every other day i do not use this serum. this not the retinoid makes my skin super red irritated that mostly goes away in a hour. hoping my skin can handle it but it does not feel gentle lol",neutral
this did nothing to my skin but i have used the drunk elephant ahabha serum before. maybe if you have sensitive skin it would be a good start but if you have tried other ahabha products this might not work for you. it also left my face feeling sticky.,negative
"the milk vegan cleanser and moisturizer i received in my voxbox from influenster. i really enjoy this product. as a skin enthusiast, i am constantly looking fortrying out new products that are natural, easy on my sensitive skin, and also give me the results i am looking for to pay for it again. the feeling of the milk cleanser is creamy and it is not very scented. it is very mild. it also makes my skin feel very clean. the moisturizer after was the cherry on top. the milk moisturizer makes my skin feel like a babys bottom. this is a contender with my current moisturizer i am obsessed with. i highly recommend this brand!",positive
"the texture of this eye cream is a bit thick and creamy. a little bit is more than enough for both eyes. it does not have any scent. the first time i used it i felt a little tingling sensation but within seconds it passed, the other times i have used it it has not happened to me again, i think it was because it was something new that i was adapting to my morning routine. i like the hydration that gives my eyes and the way it feels much firming, also i notice i look less tired i have dark circles i really believe in eye creams make a huge difference in a long time use. i really love paulas choice brand! good products good payoff and nice skin! so if your looking for your new eye cream i will recommended this one.",positive

"i was pleasantly surprised by this product! a lot of people seem to say this feels oily and does not remove their makeup, but i found it completely dissolved mine! you have to rub your face gently i used my hands and i would recommend rinsing your face with water to remove the slightly oily residue. and follower with your cleansingskincare routine. the only reason i did not give this a full stars is because it does have added fragrance, which i try to avoid using in skincare products that go on my face.",positive
"i received this for free from influenster and hourglass in exchange for my honest review. this is a thicker, unscented gel. i do like that it is unscented. looking at the ingredients list, it is very silicone heavy which i do not like. i have been using this for about a week and i notice that it feels heavy under my eyes and does not really absorb into the skin. it appears to make my under eye look oily and it pills when i apply makeup. i have dry skin and i notice this does feel moisturizing, but that is likely the silicone. i will use this until it is gone and see if i notice a difference but i do not think i will repurchase.",neutral
best face oil i have ever tried! it is goes on thick but it absorbs within a few minutes and leaves your skin glowing! i have pretty sensitive skin and it does not break me out...it actually helps with break outs! absolutely obsessed!,positive
definitely worth the money. you use a small amount and get big results!,positive
"really wanted to love this product but not completely impressed. i have small bumps i get on my forehead and i read that it would help shrink them. while it did work on some, some were not affected at all. if you have a blemish that has a white head it will help it shrink but even then i did not see the white head completely disappear. i have tried spot treatments and overnight daily treatments and they both have similar results, with only some spots shrinking in size. definitely does not get rid of any blemishes or bumps completely, though.",neutral

feels like it is melting on your skin as you put it on.,positive
this product made my face so red and broke me out. literally an hour later i already had white heads forming on my face. avoid!,negative
i never leave reviews but felt it was necessary to leave one for this product. the rose quartz rollerball is unique and a beautiful touch. the oil is fast absorbing and it does provide some hydration. the main problem with this product is the scent. when i first tested the kora oil the smell was so delightful and very hydrating. i assumed the eye oil would be the same or similar. this oil smell like fish oil and unfortunately the scent does linger.,negative
"i am shocked this has such highly rated reviews! i tried this and really did not like it. it has a strange scent and tastes terrible if you accidentally get it in your mouth. it does get the makeup off, but i ended up returning this. sticking with farmacy- so much better!",negative
"i really wanted to love this sunscreen but hated it because every single time i used it, it caused me to break out or get a new pimple. for context, i am blessed with pretty good skin and normally do not break out. and even tried to use it sporadically to get my skin more used to it. however, without fail, any time i used this sunscreen, it would cause a new blemish. definiely returning. the shiseido urban environment and the glossier invisible shield both work a lot better.",negative

"i bought this product because i wanted to add a vitamin c into my routine in order to even out my skin tone. i had tried another vitamin c before, but unfortunately, that one irritated my skin. to its credit, this product did not irritate my skin at all and actually gave it a nice glow. however, even after using this product for several months, it did not even out my skin tone at all, nor did it help fade any of my acne scars.",negative
this serum seem like every other serum i have tried the texture is different it is more of balance texture meaning it is not too thin or too thick. the serum feels smooths and apples easy on the skin. this serum reminds me of similar serums i got like the kypris anti-aging serum. i do believe this serum is more price friendly but i prefer the my favorite serum. this serum feels more drugstore skincare. some benefits are that the serum is better than most drugstore serums but that only is because of the texture and how smooth it feels on the skin. i honestly would not purchase this serum because i have serums that are my favorite and work best for my skin type. i would recommend this product for beginners and teenagers so they start using serums and know the benefits of using serums especially if you know which ones are the best for your skin type. received this item from buzzagent for an honest review.,neutral

"i use in the morning after washing my face. i love it and i have seen impact visible impact it has had with weeks of use. i had some acne marks and the only addition to my routine was this vitamin c tonic lotion, the scars are less visible now",positive
"oh man i have used this for years and loved it, but they recently changed the formula and its just not a thick night cream any more. it feels much more watery and- in short- cheapened. so disappointed.",neutral
i original received this in an ipsy bag about three years ago and it was the first thing i would tried from the brand. i have normaldry very sensitive skin. this cleanser is amazing and gentle and i have repurchased it a bunch of times. it lasts a long time even though the tube seems small. this honestly saved my skin.,positive
"i bought this product and i have been using this product for over months along with the essences as it says it will enhance the product. this product did nothing for me. i mainly bought it to help with the pigmentation and spots on my face and i heard it helps with that. i do like the feel its not too sticky, i have tried others that are super sticky and feels gross.",negative
"firstly i am in my s so i usually use high end skincare products. this anti-aging serum was just okay compared to what i usually use. on the plus side, it is vegan and clean at sephora. it goes on smoothly, smells earthy and did not irritate my eyes or skin. i used it for over a week and it did not work as well as my more expensive serum. this might be good for someone younger who is preventing wrinkles and fine lines, but someone who already has them, it does not diminish them.",neutral
"not a good product or good packaging. the actual serum sometimes stings when i apply it and leaves my cheeks with redness and irritation. is not niacinamide supposed to help with those issues, not make them worse? noticed no improvement with my dark spots. but the worst part is the packaging. the dropper does not work and the serum is so thick that it clings to the dropper and gets all over the mouth of the bottle. this is the second fab product i have purchased where i was extremely disappointed by the bad packaging.",negative
this product has quickly become one of my favorite products! the clean and vegan formula immediately caught my attention since i am a vegan and try and keep my products as clean as possible. i received this as a gift from sephora and i honestly love it. it is not expensive and does an amazing job at keeping my under eyes moisturized and i have noticed that i do not have as bad dark under eye bags. it also does not irritate my eyes like some other eye creams. very happy with this product.,positive
i have always had what you called raccoon eyes since a child. under my eyes would be dark and extremely dry. i have started using this product dec. it helped my dark circles. i have been using this in conjunction with the obagi nu system and it took away my dark circles completely. i wear it every night under my eyes. it boosted my confidence a lot.,positive
i wanted to try this because of all the good reviews but it did nothing for me at all.,negative
absolutely love this moisturizer. i have super dry skin and i have tried several cheaper brands but this is the only one that consistently keeps my face hydrated and smooth year round. i am excited to try the serum next!,positive
"i love this microfoliant. the ease of it being so fine and able to just shake a little out and use it without hands being all oily or slick is refreshing. it was odd at first to use, just because it is as fine as flour so you can get a little dust when opened and shaking, but works well and skin feels nice and not roughed up as others can do. the other problem i have is, because it is so fine, if some spills on an area and you do not notice, it could scratchrough up the surface if you drag it on your feetsock or something. has not happened but i feel that it could happen.",positive
"light daily moisturizer, great smell, glides on almost like water. would buy again but not a holy grail.",positive
i received the point sample for this product and used it for a couple of weeks- i definitely noticed that my pores got smaller and my skin looked even and did not break out with it. i do not think it has much success with fine lines which is why i reduced by a star. i do not think it is worth the price- it was just fine- i have used better serums.,neutral
"loved the oil, it does hydrate and feels good on your skin. but the rubber part of the bottle broke after weeks. will not purchase again.",neutral
"i received this as a sample and will be purchasing the full priced product. after about a month of using this day and night, i have noticed a huge reduction in my redness around my cheeksnose. i also use it as a serum over retinol under another moisturizer and this has helped mitigate the irritation. simply fabulous.",positive
"omg! it was amazing, super lightweight and felt so moisturizing! i normally hate sunscreens because they feel uncomfortable on my skin but this is just top tier! recommended",positive
"product did not work for me but i have combo skin. in my couple dry spots on my cheeks and nose it was life changing! nothing could ever hydrate those they have always been flaky. but the rest of my face is super oily and this was very heavy hard to apply, light texture but thick and hard to rub in. i really wanted to love this because of the great ingredients but it was too heavy and would not soak into my oily areas. unfortunately did not work for me but i could see someone loving this that has dry or flaky skin because it make a world of a difference there. extremely hydrating that is no doubt and plumpness and moisture lasted all through the night, when i woke up and touched my face it still felt moisturized. also i am extremely sensitive and have rosacea and this did not because any irritation. i am going to keep hunting for my hg and stick to gel based creams instead",neutral
"i received this product complimentary for testing purposes.i have used this product for a week, both in the morning and at night. i have not noticed any difference in my skin. the consistency and scent are nice though.",neutral
this product made my face broke out even more after using it for a week. i do not think it is made for my skin type. does not work for my oily skin type.,negative
"i wanted to try a exfoliant as my skin seemed to be getting used to the paulas choice bha, this was a mistake. after using this and noticed my skin feel more textured and rough, my pores enlarged, and my face breaking out again",negative
horrible product. i am and know what i am doing. it pills up over skincare. skincare pills up over product. it leaves a white cast no matter how tiny the amount you use. save your money.,negative
"i used the whole bottle and there was no change in my acne scars at all, and did not interrupt the formation of any other acne scars either. even in my lightest acne scars there was no change...do not waste your money!!",negative
"gold. i bought this extremely skeptical. i have really sensitive acne prone skin. usually my face is oily but because of the cold weather, my face tends has dry patches here and there which causes more acne. i used drops of the lapis oil with my moisturizer god send! my face is fully moisturized and i do not have any breakouts- i am just so happy with this product, will continue buying this.",positive
says lightweight but made my combo skin breakout with cystic acne right away.,negative
"love this product! it is super gentle and feels great on your skin. literally feels like a facial massage every time i cleanse with this. i have facial eczema and certain cleansers can irritate it, but this one did not at all. i will say that i prefer a deeper clean in the evening, so i use this cleanser in the mornings just to wake my skin up. disclaimer i received this product free for testing purposes.",positive
"i truly do not understand how someone could like this product. i received a sample with my order and the product was separated in the tube, weird but i mixed together and applied. it gives zero moisture but leaves a greasy cast on your face, not in a natural glow kind of way. also, it did not work with makeup. i buy lots of moisturizers from sulwhasoo, tatcha, skinfix. all are much better.",negative
"i wanted to love this so much because it left my skin looking so soft and dewy, but it broke my out so bad in the area under my cheekbones i would get this painful, cyst like pimples in just that area.",negative
i got a free mini sample from a purchase and i bought the full size on amazon because i wanted it the next day. this cleanser is one of the few cleansers that cleans my face and i do not wake up with a new pimple or irritated face. left my face soooo soft and in the morning it still felt very moisturized. i am in love,positive
i love facial oils but they sometimes make my acne prone skin break out so i have to be careful which ones i use. this one is my far one of my favorites. melts into my skin and makes it feel super plump and hydrated... i am a fan!,positive
great toner for combination skin! works wonders on cleansing deeper in the skin and helps even everything out without stripping it down.,neutral
"i have had mixed feelings about the drunk elephant product line, but i have to say that i love this moisturizer. it goes on easily, has a nice light scent and my skin feels hydrated. the only thing that bothers me is the packaging. there is a lot of plastic and not as much product as i would like there to be.",positive
it smells terrible! i gave it time but had to wash my face after minutes because i could not take it. bleh! so much for that sample.,negative
"so good! this is a really good serum for acne and evening out the skin. it is really soothing and non irritating, i love this so much!",positive
this peel is everything. i use this twice a week and my pores are visibly smaller and my skin is glowing! definitely recommend if you have oily skin like myself and need an at home peel that will clear you up!,positive
bring back the old formula! this causes my face to be oilier than it has ever been! ugh!,negative
"so i bought the smaller size to try it out, i have combo skin with acne that is under control and congested skinpores. the granules are relatively large but i can still use it daily, my issue is the product does not wash completely off. i like my cleansers to not give a squeaky clean tight feeling but i do not like it when i feel an oily residue either, i could def tell there is olive oil in this formula because it feels like i have the leftover residue. it is not severe and if you use a toner afterwards it is not a big deal. as for the efficacy, i do not think i saw any? it is certainly not a miracle changing product, it is pretty much a mild salicylic acid wash with micro exfoliants and a little bit of olive oil for moisture...",negative
"ok so first i absolutely love the brand fresh, on of my favourites by far next to peter thomas roth. second i did not purchase the full sized product but i did receive a deluxe size. so, this product smells great and the texture is definitely an exfoliant. i have used this now a few times and it works great as an exfoliant, although i love the freash sugar face polish exfoliator waaay more. i only gave this product stars because i still had to use a cleanser afterwards which obviously is not ideal",neutral
i received this product to try from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. i am always looking for a new spf to add to my daily routine but this one fell short for me. the scent was light but i prefer less scent. the texture felt nice going on but i was not a fan of how it felt after it dried a bit. it left my skin slightly tacky. i tried multiple times to make sure it was not something else i was using it in combination with but on my skin it did it no matter what. this is not something i would purchase on my own.,neutral
"i am not the biggest fan of this product. it stings when it gets into your eyes, making taking mascara off an issue and you need three pumps to really get the makeup off. it is nice in that it does not leave your skin feeling dry or squeaky and it washes off well but the stinging of the eyes takes away all of those good things. i tried this out to see if i prefer cleansing oils or cleansing balms but i would sooner go back to farmacys green clean cleansing balm before buying this again. try it out if you wish but i would not reccomend.",neutral
"i had the opportunity to try this treatment before it officially launched and i have been using it for the past week and i am already seeing a huge difference. i was worried that this treatment would be extremely drying on my skin, but that was not the case. it is extremely lightweight when it goes on and it does not leave your skin feeling tight or dry whatsoever. this honestly is like a miracle treatment because it helps with smoothing uneven skin texture, lightening acne scars as well as diminishing the size of existing blemishes! i have used so many serums and treatments and none of them tackles all of these problems like this one does. if you have acne-prone skin, you really need this in your skincare routine!",positive
this toner truly made my skin feel and look more even and smooth after only one use. i am so happy glow recipe added a toner to their line! the consistency is not watery it is more like a liquidy gel i guess you could say! i just ordered more today.,positive
"i tried twice a week, my skin is a combination of oily and dry. there was a burning sensation on the dry parts of my face and a tingling sensation on the oily parts. it worked on my dry skin and rehydrated it making it glow. my oily skin however created more acne. i suggest using this on dry skin and not the oily parts of your face.",neutral
bad! used for days and my eye area is so dry and i feel it burnt my skin.,negative
i was super relaxed with my skincare routine during a recent camping trip. sun sweat sunscreen super congested skin. i used this mask once for min before bed and woke up to noticeably nicer skin. one star lost for price as this pot will not last long.,positive
"gifted by fresh beauty. i like the glass packaging, and the easy to use dropper. i use every night after toning and retinol treatment. it works really well with my other skincare items. i put a some drop on my forehead, and both cheeks, i use a circle motion and it really absorbs well into my skin. i wake up with clear, glowing, refreshed skin. highly recommend!",positive
"honestly, this should be marketed as a primer. i gently apply it to my skin. within a minute the vitamin c disappears, leaving a fantastic silicone primer on my face. i apply foundation overtop for a perfect finish. i have had so many people think i was not wearing foundation and concealer at all because it was so smooth.",positive
"honesty!! i had a sample of this new product. i liked it, however would i buy it for?? i do not think so. left my face fresh and clean however it was not wow for me. i would definitely have to try it again.",negative
dehydrated and sensitive skin saver. pricy but worth every penny,positive
"jadore kiehls, mais ce produit et il est arrive en mauvais etat la texture nest pas bonne, la partie aqueuse se separe de la partie grasse. jai quand meme applique le produit et il ma irrite terriblement les yeux! jai averti sephora et ils nont pas voulu echanger ce produit. incroyable... vraiment decue!!!",negative
love the product! hate the packaging. the dropper stops working when there is more than a of the product left!,positive
this cleanser is amazing! leaves my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. i have horrible acne caused by congestion and this cleanser is a game changer! my skin has never felt so nice after washing. not sure how effective it is in taking off heavy foundation as i wash my face first then cleanse with this on heavy makeup days.,positive
"the suncreen was a little disappointing. it has an orange tint and does not smell like peach blossoms to me. the smell is not awful though. it leaves a sticky feeling on my legs. i did not get burned, so that was a plus. will still be looking around for a good spray sunscreen with high spf.",neutral
"this product made my skin feel nice, but overall, i did not see any difference in my skin maybe- difference. overall i would not recommend this.",neutral
"i got a deluxe sample of this product with one of my sephora purchases. the smell is nice and citrusy without being overwhelming. in three days i noticed a difference in my skin-- brighter, smoother, and softer. unfortunately, it made me breakout on my cheeks. i put this product away for a couple weeks and my skin cleared up. i tried the product again and broke out again in a couple days.",negative
"normally i hate when people leave bad reviews only because of the smell, but this stuff is so rank i just cannot put it on my face. you smell rotten eggs for the next hour. i would literally rather have my acne scars or at least use something else even if it was not as effective.",negative
"first, i must say that i have a dry and sensitivereactive skin. this is a cleanser that i decided to try on my chin area when my period comes around, since i tend to have hormonal breakouts. i must say that i am impressed. i have been using this for a couple of months now and there is a big difference. i barely breakout anymore which is fantastic. call it a placebo effect, science or good luck, i will take it! and that price? drugstore can barely compete with that!",positive
"had a sample size of this and decided to try it out. only used this sunscreen, had no make up on and went outside for hours and got the worst sunburn of my life. i was not in water, did not sweat it off. this gave me no protection what so ever",negative
"i did notice a slight de- pouffing effect the mornings after i use this. other than that, my wrinkles are still there...",neutral
this burns and smells like a cheap halloween mask. i put it on and my husband immediately said what smells like pvc pipes?.. lol. it is a no for me.,negative
"seriously the worst product i have ever used on my skin, since i have started my skincare journey. it slightly tingled when i first applied it, i left it on for another minute and it escalated quickly. the burning was very intense and literally burned my face. i look like i got sunburnt. not only that, but there is physical exfoliating beads in here. a mask is already exfoliating, there should not be beads in here. and this is coming from someone who does not have really sensitive skin. so anyone who does, i would say to steer clear of this.",negative
i used it for my face and it is always uneven. it does not give you natural looking tan and it has that nasty self tanning spray tan smell.,neutral
"unfortunately, i do not notice any difference in my skin in regards to hydration, firmness or fine lines. i did not see any plumping effect but is smooths over the skin nicely and does not irritate my skin. it does not have any fragrance which is a huge plus for me. this serum lacked the hydration so i use it under another moisturizer, it works for me that way.",neutral
"i was so excited when i got a free sample of this because i had been eyeing the product for quite some time. needless to say, i am glad i did not waste my money. this not only did absolutely nothing it was like putting water on my face, but it reeks like sewage.",negative
"this mask works wonders! i really enjoy using this mask when i feel a breakout coming or when i am in the early stages of breaking out. i find it keeps my breakouts at bay and prevents more pimples from popping up. i feel like this product really cleans my face and clears out my pores. i have combinationdry skin and i do not find this product to dry my skin out or be uncomfortable. it definitely does have a cooling effect like it claims and feels really nice on my skin. immediately after removing this mask, my skin feels super soft and smooth. i would highly recommend this mask and will continue to use and repurchase in the future!",positive
"after not using retinol for almost a year while pregnant, i fell in love with this product because it really helped my skin to look better and feel better. my fine lines and acne cleared up after a few weeks and i needed that extra boost of confidence after having the baby for sure.",positive
"after using the water cream i figured i would try the dewy cream, but i do not love it. i feel like it never fully absorbs into my skin. living in hawaii where the air stays humid this cream sits on the surface and ultimately get wiped off as i sweat. i have tried using it only at night and my face feels like it gets stuck to my pillow case. this would be good if you want to spend lots of money to try slugging. i really wanted to love this product as i have only had great experiences with tatcha classic rice polish is out of this world, but this is a no go for me. i will not be repurchasing this.",neutral
does not do anything for me i do not notice any difference in my skin. not worth it especially for the price,negative
this product definitely removes makeup as it claims but my skin was not left with a very clean feeling and it caused me to break out. i have very sensitive skin and so that is not uncommon and does not really make me dislike the product. the real problem i have with this is that farmacy is selling this as a clean product and sephora advertises it as such but despite that it apparently contains pegs that are bad for us and the environment. between that and my skin reaction it is a no go for me.,negative
this reduces the puffy eyes! but i have not noticed a difference on dark circles or my bags. you cannot totally change genetics so i am happy with what this has done for the price!,neutral
"used it a hand full of times but it made no difference to the pimples i used it on. it did deter me from touching those pimples so i guess there is that, and it did not actively make anything worse. just did not work on me",negative
"i definitely notice that my skin looks brighter and more glowy when i use this consistently. i am wondering if people do not realize this contains phas and that they may actually be purging as opposed to breaking out as a bad reaction. this product is an exfoliant, so if you get pimples, you may want to check and see if you are just purging so you do not have to throw out a product. deducted one star because of the very strong pleasant, but strong citrus scent. i just do not think fragrances have a place in skincare products and it may be irritating some users skin. for that reason, stay away if your skin is sensitive.",positive
"it is a nice thick cream that applies smoothly, and it smells kind of like an orange creamsicle. it is also strongly tinted--so much that you can see orange streaks in the jar after using it a few times--and leaves me looking like an orange creamsicle, too. i did not notice any positive effects beyond what i would expect from any moisturizer. i look terrible in orange clothes, and this is not great for me, either. maybe somebody who is not so pale would have better luck.",neutral
this product is not for people for either dry skin or combination normaldry. it left the skin feeling velvety and is very light weight but i felt i still needed another moisturizer or oil on top. did not break me out or anything though and i did feel my skin felt more plump with this in my routine than without. definitely a great product for people with oily skin.,neutral
"cream skin mist is something new, it will not be for everyone... i enjoyed the cool mist feeling when sprayed onto the skin, refreshing and light weight. the smell of the product is not heavy or over powering, once the mist sets, the cream does stay on, you can feel the consistency on skin, but it was not for me, it felt too ickysticky for my skin.",neutral
"i received this product for free from influenster tatcha in exchange for my honest review. i do not even know where to begin, with my adoration for this serum. i have been using twice a day on clean skin for over a month, and my skin feels and looks like a babys bottom. i was worried that it would be too thick but the consistency of the serum is more like a light lotion, and you really do only need- small pumps to get moisture to your entire face. it has a very fresh, clean, but light scent. typically i would not care for a scented skincare product, but i actually enjoy this. with work from home life being my normal, i love the dewy look it provides to my skin throughout the day. not sure if this is the reason, but i have noticed that my rosacea and overall texture of my skin has been very tame since i began using this. i have started to limit the products that i use daily on my skin, but this is here to stay. a bottle goes a long way, as with daily use there is still a large amount in the bottle, so this may help offset any reservations of buying it at a slightly higher price point.",positive
purchased this from reading all the amazing reviews however i felt this product was very overrated. i will admit my skin feels amazing with this stuff but it also feels sticky. not sure if i would buy it again because of that,neutral
absolutely love this product! i recently experienced an acne flare up and this has helped clear my skin up. i have also noticed a glow to my skin. i will be buying it again.,positive
"this worked really well for my sensitive skin. did everything i needed it to do. packaging is so nice i bought the eye cream just to match. the only down side is the price, there a few more face creams that works well with my skin at a lower cost. which is the one reason i probably would not repurchase. bought it because it was lightweight and the packaging was nice.",positive
"lightweight, but left a slightly sticky feeling on my face after absorbing into the skin. a few weeks after opening, the moisturizer developed a faint chemical smell and i eventually found these weird orange chunks towards the bottom of the jar. will not repurchase.",negative
"i wanted so bad to love this product. everything about it is great! the product smells amazing, it is super moisturizing, has no dha smell in the morning. no gross guide color to stain my sheets and clothes and was super long wearing and not streaky! it was everything i have ever wanted in a tan!the only issue was the color! it was unbelievably orange! i normally use st tropez which i find near unbearable with the smell, stocky was and the guide color, but it gives me a nice bronzey glow. i used the dark formula which was hardly dark, it did not do much besides give me a slight orange veil and it is turned me a nice, long lasting shade of dorito orange hopefully tanluxe reformulates this product because everything else about it is amazing.",negative
"i would actually give it. stars if i could. i like the idea of this, but not the applicator, and the dark needs to be a little bit darker. all in all i will use it up, i am just not sure if i will repurchase. and even though i said i would recommend it, i am honestly not sure if i would recommend it to someone else my skin tone or deeper.",neutral
"good, but i like the original more. pads are huge, i think value is better with the original.",neutral
"overall this was an okay product. i received it free for testing purposes from influenster and was excited to try it. it went on very smooth and i liked the texture. a little goes a long way and it made a good lather. it removed thick foundation. however, this is not a product for people with dry or combination skin. it made my skin drier and overall i did not see too much of a difference between this product and others i have tried.",neutral
do not waste your money. i would give stars but that is not an option,negative
i found no difference at all with this product. the superberry overnight mask works way better it self. i will say do not waste your money on this and try the superberry overnight mask instead. you will see the difference.,negative
"i decided to only use the dots when i had a really bad pimple or two, but it required wearing the dots about three nights in a row to completely get rid of it. therefore the dots ran out super fast, even when i tried to not use them much. i only recommend these to someone who has extremely clear skin who just gets a pimple on a rare occasion.",negative
i have been enjoying these exfoliating pads- they are larger in size then most others i have used. i love that i can use these on my body as well as face- i have some places on the body that need some chemical exfoliating. the one thing i did not like about these pads is that they had no seal- so when i opened them up they were almost dry- as if the product had dried up while in the packagemail. in the future they should try to maybe repackagefix that that is why i am giving only stars.,neutral
"i did not expect much from this product. i used topic antioxidants before and believe that they are a great addition to my skincare routine. i live in florida and i am under the sun pretty much all year around. i wanted this to fade some sun spots, i thought that at its price i did not have anything to lose. after a week of applying it every morning, i see my skin showing much improvement. sun spots are already less noticeable, still there of course. but, what amazes me the most is that fine lines are also desapearing, skin seams tighter even though i am losing weight and texture is also smoothing by the day. i am years old so this is no joke. about to get more products from this line.",positive
i would not recommend this product if you have dry skin. after using this product for a week i notice that my skin started to feel more dry and when i am talking about dry it felt like sand paper. the packing is cute but this product did not work well on my skin at all,neutral
"this product feels awesome on my skin and is makeups best friend. but i am really split on whether or not to continue using because of the artificial red dye in it. chemical spf used in this product does not give a cast to the skin like physical ones do. the product has awesome ingredients to leave the skin glowy for hours without adding artificial color, so i really wish it were not in there.",neutral
i knew before buying that this product had a gritty texture. however it also pills no matter how i apply or what step i use it in my skin care. it also smells horrible. i love the ordinary products but i would not repurchase or recommend this product.,negative
this serum is a game changer! it is smells like oranges and absorbs into my skin immediately. i love that there is hyaluronic acid and vitamin c in one bottle! i have noticed that my skin is brighter within weeks of use.,positive
"i wanted to love it, thankfully i got the mini size. i little goes a long way. however it did not do much on the exfoliating part. it just felt like the product was rubbing its own self against my skin. my skin still felt the same as of pre-wash. it was pretty disappointing, but hey i used it on my body as a scrub, just so i do not feel like i wasted money on soapy gummy paste.",neutral
"i was gifted this face cream by skinfix and i am very impressed. i have very dry skin and this moisturizer locked in my routine. it absorbs very quickly and is not oily. it has a medium- thick cream texture consistency. i also works great with sensitive skin, really soothes the skin.",positive
currently use tretinoin and my face has been a rollercoaster ride of dryness and flaking. i use this serum as an extra layer of hydration under my moisturizer. i feel like this keeps my skin moist underneath and helps to keep my skin soft and flake-free. would definitely recommend this as an extra layer of hydration!,positive
"i have been using for about months now, and i am in love. it is light and hydrating, also helps to give a more even and balanced skin tone. it has a fine mist, which is a plus. the only downside is the price, but overall it is worth it. i started with the kit that contained a travel sized bottle and have been hooked since.",positive
"like spanx for your eyes. feels firmer, great for minimizing your bags and shadows they create. does not last all day, depending on your facial expressions. like better than dr brandt similar product because that one is tinted, looks really obvious later in the day. this one is clear.",positive
"i have been using this product for about? months now. it helps hydrate very nicely. however, it never helped with the redness. it also caused breakouts on my cheeks. i am not sure the reason why it effected me this way, since it does well for so many others. i do have finickysensitive skin. it is good for a nice glow and hydration, but just did not work for me like i wish it had. i recommend it perhaps for those that do not break out too easily.",neutral
"not that this product needs another glowing review, but it is amazing! the scent is nice, goes on easily, drys super fast and leaves a believable tan color. highly recommend.",positive
"this had a new texture it was very light and the smell was pleasant, kind of like minty. i did not see much of a difference with my pores. and overall it was not moisturizing for my dry skin.",neutral

"i am giving this stars because it is very nice and i think could be great for anyone without eczema. however. ever since pregnancy i have struggled with eczema on my face and neck, which i have figured out how to keep under control with my current routine. adding in this serum flared up my eczema in the same places as before and even some new ones. i think without this specific skin concern this serum would be lovely. this is the only glow recipe product i have ever not loved. i will be taking it back unfortunately",neutral

"i have purchased this product so many times! i am in love! i use this day and night after my toner and before any other serumsmoisturizers. wish there was a bigger bottle since i go through one of these once a month using twice daily. i also wish there was a pump so you could control the amount that comes out. the product however works like a dream and does not feel tacky, my skin just soaks it in. i will be buying this product till the end of time because it works so well and is so affordable. i am acne prone and this does not break me out and instead makes my skin more hydrated when using acids and actives. i recommend this to anyone! any skin type! i used to be an oil lover but it would sometimes not make my skin plump and hydrated whereas this does!!",positive
i received the rapid dark spot correcting for free to test. after using this product everyday for two weeks i felt a difference in my skin. it definitely got smoother. i also noticed a slight change in my darks spots but the difference was not huge.,neutral
i love this eye cream! it absorbs quickly and shows improves fast. i can wear less concealer due to my dark circles lighting and my under eye lines are less prominent. give this a try if you love great ingredient and phenomenal results.,positive
"within literal days i have noticed a difference and think this product works amazing. i have combination skin that is been dry recently with the temp change and breaking out and consequently scarring a lot from masking at work. this serum has helped both of those concerns in just a few days!! i give it stars just because of the smell. god, it smells bad like burnt rubber or something which sucks, but not enough to deter me from using this. also, the price is a little steep but again, that is not stopping me from using this and i will likely repurchase!!",positive
"it is been exactly one month since i have started using this product and let me tell you... it is amazing. honestly, i am not quite sure what essenes is supposed to do for the skin, but the way it leaves my skin after application is fantastic. i pour some of the product into my palm and rub my hands together then pat all over my face. it is so cool and refreshing and leaves my face feeling plump and ready for other products to be applied. it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. i would repurchase again.",positive
"do not pass this by without trying it out yourself. lovely silicone free, good on combination to dry skin. apply evenly to face and you will be hydrated all day. most people who do reviews on this site seem like they do not follow directions, ask beauty advisors in store what to do, never been to an esthetician, ect. so do not believe all the bad reviews as told to me by a ba long ago, try things for yourself otherwise you might miss out on something nice. this moisturizer beat all of the eminence organic skincare moisturizers that i have tried. thank you sephora please keep this formulation.",positive
i love the smell of this scrub and it leaves the face very smooth and soft,positive
love this product! a little really goes a long ways with this,positive
"overall this product works well with people who do not have sensitive skin. yes, the scrub is very gentil, it also smells good and does make your face appear more flawless and soft in the moment. however, for myself i started noticing increased breakouts and dark sports on my face after about weeks of use. once i stopped, my face cleared up. therefore, in my case it did more damage than good.",negative
"i thought i would try this out because i have used argan oil on my hair in the past and liked it, but i was not a fan of this one. it smells really weird and even a relatively small amount can leave my hair looking very greasy, which was not an issue with the other brand of argan oil i used.",neutral
"great at removing makeup, does not strip the face from its natural oils. pair with a good moisturizer. did wonders for my acne-prone skin.",positive
"i completely love this brand and was excited to try this new peptide cream, but it did not really do it for me. overall, i think it is a fine moisturizer, but the pricing does not match up to the product in my opinion. i have not noticed any significant results in the last few weeks, so maybe it is a slow burn, but i do not think i would pay the retail price long term to find out.",neutral
"it is a somewhat of a thick feeling eye cream and it seeps into the skin slowly. it feels very hydrating and refreshes my eyes. i do not think it does anything else really, but hydration is all i am looking for in an eye cream.",positive
i like how light this product feels on my skin. it does not make your skin feel too oily. only thing i do not like ks the smell. does not smell like sunscreen but has a bad smell nonetheless.,neutral
"two stars for the two good things about this- the ingredients and packaging which i will reuse for travel. this is not a water, it is thick like a serum, and i had to use so much product.",negative
"this oil is a game changer! i have actually stopped using makeup most days after starting using this and the deeply restorative cream from prima. i put on while my skin is moist still and it soaks right in. my face feels fresh and light after applying- but the best part is how my complexion has become more even and less pink since i started using. i wake up with hydrated, skin and love that my fine lines are being stopped in their tracks! love that it is a clean product and gluten free.",positive
"i only wear bb cream or very light foundation over sunscreen. my eye makeup is generally just brow pencil, mascara, and maybe some eyeliner. i always use makeup remover if i have on eye makeup. i have to use an excessive amount of this cleanser to remove my makeup and sunscreen. i never felt like this removed all the product. i did not feel clean using this as a morning cleanser either. the only thing i like about this product is the light, inoffensive smell. it smells similar to classic neutragena.",negative
"i got two samples with my order. i used one sample on my face before sleeping. i woke up with such soft and smooth skin! i did not notice anything with my pores. the dry and rough acne scars i had were smooth and evened out. i loved it so much i squeezed the second sample into a sample jar and am only using it on rough scars all over my body. it smells like a thick moisturizer with a faint whiff of blueberries. the texture is of a thick moisturizer. nice lavenderlight blue color.while i do love the formula and cream, the full-size product is wayyyy too expensive for me to buy. if there are farmacy samples in the future i will absolutely pick them recommend others pick them. but will i buy any farmacy product? no, nor will i recommend it based off the price alone.",neutral
"the price is too high, it does not do anything. it did not moisturise my skin. the fine lines were getting worse while i was using this. do not waste your money on this.",negative
i have been using dr. dennis gross skincareadvanced retinol ferulic triple correction eye serum along with the advanced retinal ferulic wrinkle cream. i am a skin care junkie and besides braking my bank these products do not work at all. my dark circles are darker and the skin is almost translucent. so disappointed. it contains retinal so does that mean i cannot use other skin products with it?,negative
"i really like this moisturizer. i have oily and dehydrated skin and i bought a sample with my points. it is a very thick moisturizer, but not as thick as a night cream. even though it is thick, i really feel it absorb into my skin and i do not feel like it is sitting on top of my skin. it is great as a pre-makeup moisturizer. i do not know what fragrance people are talking about. it smells like the ingredients that are in it, just like all the elemis products smell like the plants they put in it. i have never had a problem with either.",positive
"this sunscreen has a thin, serum-like consistency, which i usually love. this is one of the worst sunscreens i have tried in a looong time. very greasy, does not absorb, pills like crazy! it does not matter what skincare you put under it or what makeup you put on top...be ready for a messy result a disappointing finish.",negative
garbage. broke me out. you can find better products for less than half the price that has worked for me.,negative
"wow the combination on this one with caffeine, kakadu plum, micro algae and peptides is amazing. usually you either get caffeine or peptides, one or the other separately but this one has it all. i am very curious to see how my eyelids look in the coming weeks with this product.",positive
"it was just okay. i did not care for the scent it was rancid and maybe i received an old product. it made my skin soft and did not make me break out, but i could not get past the scent.",neutral
"i have used this for months and have not seen results. i have oily skin so maybe this is for drier skin types and sensitive skin. i personally find it does not absorb well for me, pills with other products if you do not wait minutes for it to dry, and just does not brighten as much as i would like. i have found other niacinamide that works better. if you are on a budget though, this is very budget friendly.",neutral
leaves my sensitive skin refreshed but not irritated,positive
"for cold northeast winters, i use this overnight and wake up perfectly hydrated. for the summer, it is a bit heavy. i wake up a little oily and i am breaking out a little bit so might have to find a different night moisturizer for the summer.",positive
"fairest skin with hyperpigmentation, occasional breakouts, and large pores. i do not get the hype. that is really my full review. i wore this multiple nights in a row when i received it and saw nothing change. i know it takes three months of consistent use to see effects, so i worked it into my routine to use every other night. six months later i still have yet to see this do anything. i am not mad i tried it out as the price is bottom-of-the-barrel compared to almost all of their skincare at sephora. it is worth buying to test for yourself.",neutral
"i usually love herbivore products, but this one is not it. you have to use a lot to get any sort of scent or change to the water. it does not leave your skin feeling any different either.",negative
"i have used up one tube and it works really well. i am a full-time engineering student and staying up all night is probably like my weekly routine. whenever i feel dull and dehydrated on my skin, i just apply a layer of this onto my face and i could rise with a healthy glow on my face. even though this does no good to my dark circles, still it balances oil and water when my skin is dehydrated during awaken nights.",positive
"very thick making it not the easiest to spread, but for the price point it is still a good moisturizer. it does its job but there may be drugstore brands such as cerave which can do just as good of a job with a more lightweight formula,",neutral
"this clogged my pores and broke me out, returned it afterwards unfortunately. consistency reminds me of petroleum jelly.",negative
"amazing product! i use with dr. devgans hyaluronic serum, and my skin has never looked better!",positive
"i love this serum! i am so i wanted to find a retinol that would help with prevention. i do not need anything very concentrated yet. this serum is not harsh and has not caused me to break out at all. i have noticed my few fine lines have started to fade a little bit. i do not use this every night i switch it every other day with the ordinarys rose hip oil at the very end of my skincare routine. the fact that it is orange is so fun too! my only complaint is that my dropper is defective. it comes out of the bottle completely full and then drips without being squeezed. not a big deal though, i would still definitely buy this again!",positive
"this product is wonderful for my sensitivecombination skin. it has skin calming properties, which i am fascinated by! it also managed to not make my combo skin more oily, and soothed the sensitive skin part upon application. highly recommend product due to its gentleness.",positive
wanted to love this product but it sadly makes me break out which is rare for my skin type.,negative
"i really am enjoying this retinol serum, i have sensitive skin and it did not because any irritation, it is a very light gel consistency and it absorbs quickly into the skin. i use it every night before my moisturizer and every morning i wake up and i see a difference in my skin, it has helped a lot with some fine lines and some discoloration",positive
"not for acne prone skin. it broke me out, i am wishing a product i can use instead foundation. it does cover my redness and acne scar but every time i put on the time when i gets home. i have acne or bump on my skin. it can happen in a hours. not recommended for acne prone skin.",negative
"honestly this was awful. it was very watery, did not lather, dried my skin which is surprising because my skin is extremely oily. on to the next",negative
save your money. please. this toner smells clean and fresh and it appealed to me because of i have been looking for a more readily accessible bha toner for my oily skin. i do not have a lot of texture because i have been diligent about preventative measures. i thought this formula wonderfully cooling when i first used it but realized how tight my skin felt. i thought it was a one off. the third time i used it i realized this was drying out my skin and noticed how much alcohol is in the formula! that cooling sensation was just the alcohol drying and the dryness on my skin was terrible. and i have so oily i have to set the fenty foundation! save you money and use witch hazel instead- leaps over this.,negative
has a nice lather but made me breakout really badly,neutral
"it is lovely when mixed with my vitamin e cream, though not so much on its own",positive
"the product is instantly soothing and feels great on the skin. i used it every day as recommend and i am not sure if i saw much of a difference, but my skin has been clear and somewhat smooth since i have started.",positive
this cream overly hydrates which is just as bad as no hydration and makes it impossible for we mua to apply makeup properly. for this price you could buy a true high end cream that is formulated to absorb properly.,negative
"i have tried three different products with aha perricone md vitamin c ester brightening amine face lift serum, farmacys honeymoon glow,",positive
"i do not understand the hype over this product. i found it did little to nothing for my skin. it very slightly reduces the look for the acne, but takes several uses to do so. i would recommend the origins super spot remover acne treatment gel if you are looking for a similar product with better results.",neutral
i have tried ilia bright start retinol alternative brightening eye cream for two weeks and i have not seen any results. when applied it has a delicate shine that makes it look like you applied a lot of cream but it is the consistency of the cream. when you use it with makeup the shine totally disappears. also the applicator is very hard and does not blend very well. i like that it is animal cruelty-free,negative
this honestly does not cover up my red better than shape tape concealer from tarte or kosas foundation. it does not deliver as much on calming and redness reduction as i would like for all the hype and the cost. i do not totally get it. it is was better than the green color correcting primer from smash box though. i think that stuff is terrible.,neutral
"i am a fan of most inky list products, but not this one. the day after i used it i broke out all over my forehead. i never get acne and there was no coincidence i got it the day after using this product.",negative
finally a serum that helps my hereditary dark circles!! and it is so affordable!,positive
"i had high hopes for this but it broke me out. it was not purging, which i read about. i broke out on places i normally do not so unfortunately it is going back.",negative
"again, i have never used a serum and now i know i need it in my life, more specifically this one! i love the way this smells, it is a plant based alternative to retinol, and if you are like me, i will not put retinol on my skin. however, this is a great alternative, it is great for sensitive skin like mine. i also do not have many wrinkles however my skin is so full of life and this glow hunny. i would recommend this product for sure. i received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",positive
the texture and scent were lovely but my face never felt completely cleansed when i used this product. it did not strip or over dry my skin but it did break me out. i wanted to love this product like i love their ultra facial cream but it just did not work for me.,negative
tried these when my dr dennis gross peel pads ran out. will not purchase again.,neutral
such a high talked about product. nothing wrong with it by any means but for the price point i think there are alternatives that are just as good or better.,neutral
"i tried to like this product. i used it multiple times to give it a fair shot, but i did not love it as a cleanser. the balm definitely leaves a residue on the skin, which then makes you feel like you want to wash your face again using a different cleanser. it is decent as a make-up remover before cleansing with another face wash. i did not explore using the balm as a mask, but will try that next.",neutral
it is too gentle and i have sensitive skin saying that. i have to leave it on for mins before i feel that it has done anything and even then it barely tightens the skin. not worth the money.,negative
"enh at best. i love the saint jane oil and though this lotion would be an excellent addition to my skincare lineup. truth be told, it is quite thin and you will need to use multiple pumps to cover your face. this left my skin sticky and hard to apply makeup over. i saw no improved appearance or feeling to my skin and for the price, that is a bummer. it did not break me out or because any reaction, which was good. it smells fine and is not a million bucks but there are far better moisturizers out there.",negative
this is a wonderful night serum. it is extremely moisturizing without being sticky and it does not leave a weird residue on my pillow. i could tell after about a week of use that in the mornings my skin felt softer and looked significantly brighter. i am a big fan of cbd products and i am happy to add this one to my arsenal.,positive
"i wanted to love this, it is everything i need in a bottle, but it did absolutely nothing for my skin except break me out! not worth the price",negative
i received this product complimentary and cannot get enough of it! i have seen a serious improvement in my complexion and my skin is so much more radiant! i was hesitant to wear it under makeup but it seriously adds such a beautiful glow to your face. try this out- you will not regret it!,positive
this product is amazing. i have tried sooooooo many masks but nothing like this one. it is very strong and the product comes a long way for the price. my skin has never better than ever.,positive
bottle is cute and all but the pump kind of sucks. i saw a similar review. i still have a lot left i have about or so left and the tube cannot pick up the rest of the product either. tried leaving it upside down overnight but that did not do anything...,neutral
does not work!!!i have been using this product for four weeks and i do not see any improvement. does not fade my dark spots and give me white head around my cheeks,neutral
creamy cleanser but nothing special or life changing.,neutral
it does not make big diference on my skin. i think it is an avarage aha toner and more expensive than other options. does not worth.,neutral
"i love this product!!! i wish it had better reviews. it feels super moisturizing and has a subtle scent. i tend to like products with little to no fragrance so i appreciate that it does not smell fake or overly coconut-y. instead, it has a rather natural and calming aroma. my skin feels so soft after a nice warm bath with this soak! my boyfriend used it and at first he thought it did nothing, but after feeling how soft his skin was, he was shocked!!! highly recommend if you are looking for a moisturizing bath experience!",positive
"i received this complementary from influenster and cannot be more thankful. i have been looking for a day serum for a very long time and this is perfect. it smells amazing, is plant based, and works. my pores are visibly smaller and some scarring is fading. for the first few days my face felt oily after using it, but i think my body has adjusted. this is my favorite part of my skincare routine. i cleanse, use this product, and then follow with a moisturizer and eye cream. i have been very happy with my skin lately.",positive
i am going to give this one a meh. not worth the price. i have used moisturizers for a third of the price with far better results. i typically love drunken elephant but this one is not a great moisturizer.,negative
"i have blackheads on my chin and nose area so i was looking for something to help clear out those pores. unfortunately, this just was not the product for me. sure it felt good on my skin and did not leave my face feeling dry afterwards but it did not clear out my pores.",negative
"easy to use and very travel friendly. i bought it mainly for traveling as things are opening back up and since it is a stick, it is tsa friendly. i do not have much wrinkles to say if it makes a big difference there but everyone says retinol is good for your skin.",positive
smells nothing like a pineapple! but does the job. definitely have better ones.,neutral
i liked the gentleness of this cleanser. i have not really noticed a huge change in my skin but my skin is not worse. only reason i probably would not purchase product is the price is out of my budget. if i saw a significant change i would be able to justify buying at that price.,positive
"not the same product as the contour cream, and at a higher price. that is a let down. i will be searching on amazon.",negative
pros it is sunscreen cons feels heavy on my face. skins instantly sweats as if it is trying to get rid of the product. too small for the price used it a total of three times and it is already of the way gone. need more of this product than the amount i use with my banana boat sunscreen. leaves face feeling heavy and greasy. overall i say try if you can get it as a sample to see how you like it although i really would not recommend anyone spend the on this when you can spend a good at the drug store on a bigger size.,negative
"i had really high hopes for this product but it did not deliver. the color of the cream is green but supposedly goes on beige but in reality since it has sunblock it lightens the color of my skin giving it an odd ghostly tint. also, the redness calming seems to be purely superficial from covering redness with the product rather than treating it is causes. i also think this irritates my eyes. i am going to attempt to return it...",negative
did absolutely nothing for me. i was hoping to find an available in store product to replace an online only sheseido product i love. unfortunately this product did nothing for my y.o. skin.,negative
"good for inflammatory skin- i have rosacea and oilycombo skin also prone to dryness and flaking. navigating skin care is more a matter of does this make things worse? and this does not. it is not a hydrating cleanser, but it is the best all-around cleanser in terms of extreme effectiveness, despite extreme gentleness. one reason for this is possibly the concentration of the wash itself being so high, you really only need a pea size in your hand to get the full effect and i am heavy handed when it comes to skin care. and it is really the concentration of this that makes it a good deal, too. one bottle will easily last a couple of months, putting it in the lower price range esp here for quality skin care. this could sell for more if kiehls wanted, and people would still buy it, but it is an integrity that i appreciate when companies care about the people using their products and the results, more than just the. plus, since this is a step in a routine twice a day, i am not really trying to spend a whole lot, constantly. that ahhh i can breathe skin moment is a huge deal, though, despite it is gentleness. it has reduced my redness and irritation quite a bit! including acne, on a daily basis. just so there is no surprise, it does have an almost chemical smell, which is slightly off putting but also i kind of like it, and it does not stick around. use it at the end of the day by itself, or after an oil cleanser if wearing makeup.",positive
"really like this product, but my most recent purchase i was so disappointed to discover that the formula has changed!! glad to know it is reef safe now, but omg the formula and smell before was soo good. still love the body oil and that it has a high spf. it is pretty pricey for the amount you get, and with body oil it is easy to run through it quickly.",neutral
nothing special nice light lotion but not life changing or anything.,neutral
"so i do like this product, especially in my morning routine... but it pills under makeup. i wish it did not otherwise i would give it a higher rating.",neutral
"i might be crazy, but on my first day trying this out, i got a sunburn on my face. i was out on a soccer field on a sunny day for about an hour. my cheeks and chin were red when i got home. faded after a couple of days. i am going to give this another try because i like the feel of it and the color actually works for me. i am sharing an awful photo of myself when i got home and assessed. i will update this review after another try when my skin is ready.",neutral
this tiny product of moisturizer is i must have been out of my mind to purchase this. it feel like thick elmers glue i hate it!!!!!!!!!,negative
"great subtle coverage and of course the spf is awesome. goes on easily with just your fingertips and blends well. the only thing is it definitely leaves a tacky feeling on your skin- which i prefer to the greasy feeling of most sunscreens, but i wish it just soaked in and did not feel at all. however, since it is a pigment, essentially makeup, that is not really a realistic expectation, so i still like it and prefer to use it over regular foundation! lasts all day, too.",positive
"i have been trying this for a month now. i cannot see much difference with this serum. it is sticky but not bad. and i do not know why my skin peels off after using it. i have dry skin which might be a concern. so, i would not recommend this for dry skin. it absorbs nicely sometimes and sometimes it does not. but, when i use this with the ordinary moisturizer it seems okay. i am also using the ordinary rosehip seed oil at night after this serum but likewise, my skin peels off. so it might not be good to use oil products after using this serum. i will try again for month and see the results. and see how is that is going to work. if it works then i will come again to give it a star if not i am not buying it again.",neutral
it is okay i guess. it does not irritate my skin but it does not do much either,neutral
i love love this. i wear it during winter before leaving on walks- in quebec so this is a must. i also wear it before going swimming and i find the chlorine does not dry up my skin as much. it is really such a great simple product. whenever you need some extra hydration i put it on and sleep with it.,positive
has a light smell and after using it my face broke out acne may just be me but not a fan of it. and for the price definitely not something i would go buy.,neutral
would give stars is possible. i have extremely oily skin. i have used this for going on a year now and i will never go without. life changing honestly.,positive
"while this product made my skin soft and smooth, it made me break out unfortunately. every time i used this my skin would break out into little white bumps. my skin is not sensitive but something in this just did not agree. the product itself is a balm texture and you do not need much to cover you entire face and neck. also, if scented products bother you this product is not for you. the scent smells kind of like baby powder to me but it does not bother me. overall, i cannot use this but maybe my mom can.",negative
"this product does take away a lot of redness. i do not have any skin conditions such as rosacea. however, i was looking for a tinted sunscreen that could take away the redness around my mouth and nose. after trying many different moisturizer combinations, this product will not sit on my face properly. i feel like this product might sit better if i used a primer, but i wanted something that i could put on quickly in the morning. even applying it with a beauty blender, this product is very noticeable. however, i found if i mix this product with some of my other sunscreens tatcha and josie maran that it does look better. so, the trick with this product may be mixing it with other products that blend better.",neutral
"this was only okay. it has a strong floral scent that i did not like and my skin reacted with a rash. the positive on this was the glow my skin had, although, it did not feel like it was being absorbed. i likely would have continued to use this had it not been for my sensitive skin which is why i gave this stars.",neutral
ok...so i usually do not write reviews but i have been on a search for a toner that shrinks my pores and i cannot even express how different my skin feels after using this for days. toners i have used in the past dry out my skin but this one leaves a nice moisture after use. i love this so much and i do not want it to run out!,positive
"thankfully i received this product as a sample but o has high hopes. after all, this face cream is ridiculously priced so it should offer the best results, right? wrong. it smells terrible and every time i use it, i notice a new blemish on my face. i am pretty sure this is what is causing it since i eat relatively clean and i almost never incorporate new products into my routine. if i bought this with my own money i would be extremely disappointed. use anything else.",negative
"this is an okay essence, it is not very hydrating after it sinks in. i hate applying it with cotton pads or rounds because i feel like it is a waste, so i have it in a mister. i have noticed a difference in my overall skin glow and tone, i am noticeably less red, more even toned. i later this under a moisturizer and sunscreen usually. my main complaint is the horrible smell. i know the essence is fermented, but it smells so awful, and it is very noticeable. it makes using it unpleasant and i am struggling to get through it. i have other mists and toners much more refreshing and pleasant to use at much cheaper prices.",neutral
this was super sticky for me even after a few hours. i felt like my face was dirty and i did not seem to be getting any benefits from it.,negative
it is a decent product. although it does smell of sulfur and the green color means i can only use it at night. it helps my acne calm down and sometimes come to a head if it has not yet,neutral
i have tried every eye cream out there and this is the only one that has made me break out all around my eyes. stars because i did actually notice and improvement in my dark circles.,neutral
i love the banana moisturizer and thought i would try this. i am so disappointed that the jar is so deceivingly small. the jar houses a smaller container with the lotion. it has the illusion that there is significantly more of the product. i hate when companies do this.,neutral
this product is nice for dark circles only. i do not consider my skin sensitive but the high concentration of vitamin c made my skin under my eyes dried out. does not hydrate at all. i would say after weeks of use i only see about a improvement.,neutral
although i have never tried this particular kind you should not ever take vitamin d without k they need to be taking together or combined. it enhances the effectiveness absorption and also helps so you do not have side effects. look into before taking alone just a heads up.,positive
"i have been putting off using this trial size product due my sensitive skin for a while now, due to not having success in finding the right toner for my skin type. this toner is a little on the strong side, with some time figuring out what works best for me i now use it every- days during the evening. with that being said, this ren toner works!!! dead skin gone! skin feels tighter, smoother brighter. i suggest if you have sensitive skin a little goes a long way, you do not have to drench your face with it.",positive
"this stuff is fun! the color makes it stand out, for sure. i love the shimmery purple. makes it feel special. also, the fragrance is a bit strong too, but i like it. however, if you are not a big fragrance person it may bother you. i have very sensitive skin that usually reacts to stuff right away. i put this on and it made my skin feel really nice. the next morning my skin brighter and looked supple, but by the end of the day i noticed some red pimples forming on my cheeks. i hardly ever get pimples there, so that is how i know my skin is reacting to a new product. i tried it again the next evening, and again, more pimples. i stopped using it until the pimples went away, just to be certain, and the same thing happened. sigh i would recommend trying it. it may just work for you if your skin is not as reactive as mine.",neutral
does not help with black heads the bottle is tiny and paid dollars i will not re buy this product,negative
"i have been using this for a month along with the plum plump moisturizer. it feels good. it works well with other products. i hardly smell plums. it plumps the skin. does it do anything? i do not know. i cannot tell. it is not worth, more like. i am going to finish it up. not sure if i will buy again.. black. female.",neutral
"i got a small bottle ml of this toner as a sample. this was my first time adding toner to my skincare routine and i regret not doing this before! i had been dealing with cystic acne for about years that left dark and deep scars. i have only been using this for about days and i can already see my scars fade with every use! there are some areas that sometimes sting very little for a bit when i put it on, but i do not mind it. i also have a very oily t-zone with a lot of texture. but now my skin is not as oily and feels so smooth! i also do not really like the smell it smells like slime, if you have ever smelled it, but it goes away as soon as it dries. i think the sample bottle will last me a couple of weeks, although it is a bit pricey, it is worth the money! i will most likely purchase it when i finish the sample bottle.",positive
"this toner adds a great glow to the skin, but the smell was strong enough to give me a headache. used along with the other guerlain products in the line, it truly reduce the appearance of pores on my skin and gave it such a dewy finish! you can tell that these products are great quality, my only gripe was with the smell. it is strong enough to be an issue for someone like me with sensitive skin and a sensitive nose.",neutral
"i think if you have oily skin this would work better for you than it did for me. i have very dry skin and after apllying it, i felt like i put nothing on! my skin was still dry and almost felt worse than it did before applying, it. i only took off two stars because i think this is just one of those products that does not work well my dry skin but it might for others!",neutral
"love this balm! my makeup is usually limited to light primer, some highlighter, mascara, eyeliner some brow gel, so i cannot attest to it is ability to remove heavier makeup such as foundation, but it does an amazing job especially in removing my eye makeup. i have sensitive combination skin i do not get any irritation or dryness at all after use, my skin actually feels amazing after use.",positive
"i have to say that when i received the korres greek yogurt foaming cream cleanser i was pretty excited as i used it i would say that although it definitely cleansed my face and ensured that all my make up came off but it is nothing to jump up and down about. it is something i would definitely use again it is clean and it works for my skin and i have extremely sensitive skin. however, i would not say it is life-changing it is just something simple if you are just looking for a simple cleanser with no chemicals.",positive
love this serum. very lightweight and silky and a little goes w long way i use one pump every morning. i am currently on accutane so my face is very dry and sensitive and this serum did not irritate or bother my skin at all- it did a very noticeable job lightening my scars and healing red spots on skin! there is a light fresh scent but it is all natural fragrance so nothing sensitizing. if i had anything negative to say it would be that the serum can feel a bit sticky or tacky if you do not let it dry down before applying a moisturizer so try to be patient and wait a few minutes. niacinimide is also an amazing ingredient included in this serum.,positive
"i received this cream in a sephora favourites set. it is the old formula with the darker blue bottom and white lid. it is scented which would probably be an issue for others, but i enjoy it. it reminds me of nivea cream. it is thick and moisturizing so i only use it before bed. my skin feels soft, supple, and not at all dry. highly recommend but sadly you cannot buy it anymore.",positive
i loved this at first but tossed it in a bin half way through. keeps my skin hydrated but it makes me break out baaaaad,neutral

"what a beautiful product! i was sent this product to review and was skeptical because i am just not that into trying new products. however because of its large array of ingredients i do like, i was interested to see how it works. this product is packed with great products like bakuchiol, vit c, hyaluronic acid, aloe, ceramides etc. and it shows when you put it on your skin. when i first put it on it was super creamy, but lightweight and absorbed right into my skin. it felt hydrated and smooth. although it was nice, i feel like there are other products that are more hydrating than this. it did not make my skin feel dry afterwards, but after- minutes, i almost felt like i needed to reapply some. it may also be that it is wintertime and cold. i will continue to try this in hopes that it will make my skin more and more hydrated! also, if you have sensitive skin, this is a great product to try-- my skin has been super fussy and it gave me no problems!",positive
"i have cystic acne that is persistent. it ebbs and flows and now that i have started a new birth control, i am breaking out like a hormonal teenager i am. it is embarrassing! i have been using this for just under a week now. i am acne prone with a very oily t-zone with combination skin. i never have a problem with staying moisturized because i am so oily. however, this did try out my face immensely, as expected, it is benzoyl peroxide! i use- pumps twice a day following my cleansing routine, then apply moisturizer. it drastically evened out my skin texture-wise. i only feel a few bumps when i cleanse my skin is smooth!! now to get rid of scarring. i cannot believe how quickly this helps rid of my cystic acne. i have only gotten one breakout since starting this within the last week! high hopes. i also love the exfolikate cleanser!!",positive
"i looooved this mask, until i started exfoliating on a weekly basis. when i used this mask again, it caused a lot of irritation, redness, and bumps. choose exfoliating, or using this mask, not both!! maybe i will give it a try again, but i am pretty bummed about how it left my skin recently. use with caution!",neutral
i have been using this eye cream for years and this last time i bought it i noticed the packaging label had changed. i thought nothing of it and started using it as usual. my eyes became irritated progressively until i finally realized the eye cream was to blame and my eye area was super irritated. i am so disappointed that i need to begin my search for a new eye cream.,negative
people were so right about the peeling!! it is better if you have no other skin care after washing your face and if you only use a little product. i tried patting inrubbing inno skin carewith skincare..,neutral

"good cleanser, but such a small bottle for what you pay. i would compare it to philosophy cleanser, it is gentle, not heavily scented, and takes all makeup including eye makeup well. i just do not think i can justify the price for the amount you get. i have had this for about a month using it twice a day and i am halfway done. my other cleansers last at least a few months.",neutral
"awful... after so many great reviews i was excited to try de. i purchased the littles to sample and see if i wanted to make the plunge try a new line. washed my face, used framboos night serum the next day i had the worst breakout of my life. i hardly breakout and to wake up from my nose to lower chin to chin all covered in acne was deeply upsetting. days later and now just starting to clear up....still red and patchy. learned my lesson, no thank you de!",negative
sits on top of the skin. does not soak in. feels very greasy. does not keep skin moisturized for long.,negative

"i have been using this exfoliator during my pm skincare routine for about a week now and honestly do not see what all the rave reviews are about. i think it works as well as any exfoliator should and is very natural smells like rice, but i have not seen a noticeable change to my skins texture that i would expect from such an expensive product. would probably be really good for sensitive skin. i have previously used the kate somerville exfoliator and loved it and probably will end up going back to it. debating returning this one as i do not think it is worth the price.",negative
"i do not see anything really special about the cleanser. however, i do love love love the light fragrance it has. the tube randomly busted from the top seam and good amount got wasted in the sink. it clogs easily.",neutral
"this product is absolutely amazing. i have used and loved tatcha for a few years now starting with the rice powders, and everything is amazing. this product in particular is wonderful because it is a gentle cleanser that exfoliates and foams slightly without harsh additives that can strip skin of moisture. i am quite careful with the moisture in my skin and the cleansers i use because your cleanser is the foundation of your skin care and can determine how the rest of your routine behaves and can benefit you. i personally use it as the second cleanser in my double cleanse after farmacys green clean cleansing balm. coupled together is literally something out of this world. my skin has never loved something more than this duo! i hope neither are ever discontinued completely because i will cry! not really, but you know what i mean. the only single improvement i would love to see is a finer granule that is broken down quicker and more of them. something in between the exfoliator this has and the rice enzyme powder texture would be phenomenal. it still is quite a lovely product, though. definitely worth buying and gifting to others!",positive
"i use this product under makeup because it sinks into the skin and does not leave a sticky feeling. it definitely plumps up my wrinkles and seems to have a lasting effect if used consistently. do not forget to use it on your lips and eyes too! i have tried other ha serums, but they did not have visible results or they left a sticky residue on my skin. i use her super anti-aging serum at night under a good moisturizer and wake up with smoother and less wrinkled skin. her products work without any weird ingredients. i do not apply her products as she recommends because it seems wasteful and let us face it her products are expensive. i apply a little serum to the tip of a finger and apply it to one section of my face at a time. i probably only use half a dropper or even a little less for my whole face. then i will apply a tiny bit extra to specific wrinkles. i find that if i layer her products, it will leave a sticky residue and pill up under makeup, so i only use this one if i am going to apply makeup. i will layer sometimes at night.",positive
"i really wanted to love this product. i have tried it three separate times for over weeks of use each time and it breaks me out like craaaazy. i have acne prone combo skin. i guess if you are acne prone, maybe steer clear.",negative
"okay hear me out, the product itself is highly recommend! my issue is with the cost. i am normally not picky about cost with skincare, especially if you are investing a lot in the science behind it, but since this does exist elsewhere, and for much cheaper, it lead me to believe the markup is for the pretty packaging.",neutral
"so so disappointed in this product!! i love glow recipe and really wanted to love this. it was way too expensive for the size, especially since it pills! i have never experienced this before... the product pills and you end up with pilling after maybe- minutes of application. i would not mind spending this much on a product from a company i like if it is truly luxurious and does not pill. it does not feel nice when dried.. it almost made me feel a little dry. i will revisit if they reformulate this product in the future. but right now it is a major meh!",negative
"this stuff smells incredible. it is not nearly as moisturizing as i was hoping for, though. i feel like it dries on top of my skin and leaves a weird powdery film. i like to mix it with another moisturizer to avoid that issue. sadly i will not repurchase this but will enjoy it while i still have it.",neutral
i bought this before they starting selling it at sephora and its really really horrible i really hope they changed the formula,negative
"i have always had really bad cystic acne which was so tough to get rid of. i have very oily and very sensitive skin. nothing worked for me and i was really starting to give up until i randomly picked this up as my last shot. this saved my skin!!! i no longer broke out ever since i started using this. it is so gentle and leaves your face feeling fresh. it has such a lovely orangey scent to it which i do not mind at all. i went through of these already. it is definitely worth the money! i promise you, if you are trying to get rid of acne and have no hope, please give this a shot. i also have the acne clarifying cleanser by murad as well but it does not work as well as this one did for me!",positive
"it has a very nice jelly consistency with a slight cooling effect! i think that the thing that shocked me the most was the mint smell! i absolutely love mint, and the best thing about it is that the smell stays on for more than a couple of minutes. i have only had this for a couple of days but every time i use this it leaves my skin moisturized with a nice glow! after i finish this one i will definitely go by another since i love it soooo much already!!!",positive
"i saw a lot of reviews about the bad smell, not sure if they changed the formula but i do not notice a smell at all. i have dry skin and this oil is great for moisturizing, i do it at night with my gua sha as it is thicker but i love it",positive
"the reviews on the product are highly incentivized and seem like a first impression. i spent my own money on this.. so this is an authentic reviewpros it does everything it claims if you use a very sparing amount. it is very glowy, with a little bit of stickiness great for under makeup. it has a watermelon jolly rancher and sunscreen fragrance. depending on your senses it may smell strongly of watermelon jolly rancher or more on the sunscreen side. for the most part, i do not smell it on my skin after application. cons if you are serious about your sunscreen application, and you apply the recommended amount or a generous amount... this does the exact opposite of all their claims. it will feel goopy, sticky, heavy on the skin and take forever to settle in. plus if you apply this amount, it will pill. and if you have oily skin, you will end up a grease ball by the- hour..a little goes a long way. you will like it or hate it depending on how much you believe should be applied.",negative
i wanted to love this but it is sooo oily and hard to get off. a make up eraser cloth gets more make up off than this does.,negative
"good for everyday wear, but has a strong scent of creamsicles.",neutral
"best cleanser!!! i have beyond sensitive skin, and this cleanser not only does not irritate my skin but also.. takes off every bit of makeup and ever so softly exfoliates my skin. i can not be without this cleanser, he goes everywhere with me and i can not recommend this cleanser enough.",positive
"i love this product, i have actually been using this for almost a year now, and it is changed my skin dramatically. i think the reason this brand is able to make their products super affordable is because the packaging is very cheap. i just bought my second bottle of this and i was only able to use it one time before the cap started to unscrew itself every time i close it. the cap itself is kind of crooked and does not fully close. i have spilled and wasted so much of this product because i thought the cap was closed when it was not. i really would not mind paying a little bit more if they just fixed the packaging.",negative
very hydrating and smoothing spf. could work well as a primer for makeup.,positive
"love this sunscreen! i have super sensitive skin and tend to break out or have irritated skin, and this product made my face feel great! i am pregnant and have been using more natural, non chemical products and this product blows me away! so light and airy, does not feel like its caked on my face and also gives great sun coverage. totally recommend! such a great product.",positive
"with being in my s, i have noticed some age related changes to my skin. i have been using the renergie lift over the last three weeks. i like how it has almost a matte-like feel and is not greasy. it absorbs quickly and has a light and pleasant scent that i only notice for about half an hour after applying. i put it on in the morning to try and protect from more sun damage with having the sunscreen present. the skin problem i have noticed the most is lines and lack of firmness around my eyes. i think it has already helped to start and firm my skin. the lines in the corners of my eyes still look the same, but maybe they will decrease over time too.",positive
"did not so much. i have oily combo, and i love me a good hydrating mist, but this is not it. it kind feels like you just slabbed something sticky. it just does not feel good on the skin, its as if you have a residue on your skin and just sits on top. i like mist that really feel like ita goinf into your skin and not just sit. but although maybe not for me i do think if yiu have dryyyyy flakey skin you will love it.",negative
"wow, i never thought i would get my hands on a toner with such a high concentration of glycolic acid not pay through the nose for it, this stuff is incredible! i have always loved glycolic products, they make my combination skin sing this toner is no different! bit of a warning though for glycolic newbies, do not use this product every night. this is a nighttime only,- useweek max. if you plan on coupling it with another exfoliant like i do boscias exfoliating peel gel, i would honestly cut it to once a week, that is what i have been doing it is working out great! personally, i let the glycolic do it is thing at night, then i exfoliate in the morning with the peel gel, my god... i have never seen the peel gel pull so much from my face in one go. i strongly recommended discussing it is use with a dermatologist beforehand if you plan on using it more than twice a week. i got a little crazy when i first bought it, used it three nights that week, my face broke out skin rubbed off unexpectedly when putting on oil... made me a little red, nothing crazy though. i took a break now my skin is back to its usual, glowy self.",positive
its a good moisturizer but after trying this product for a significant period of time i can confidently say that i will not be purchasing this one. not because of the performance but of the pricepoint. the product is very good do not get me wrong. but it did not do anything amazing to my skin. i would recommend this if you have extra money to spend! by the way this was gifted,neutral
"i love this toner! it is super smooth and makes my skin feel amazing. i will say, there is a strong watermelon scent so if you are sensitive to smells, i would choose a different toner. the texture is the slightest bit sticky and gooey, but i love that feeling because it actually sticks to your face and does not make it feel wet. it makes your skin feel super smooth! my pores are noticeably smaller after only a few uses",positive
love deciem and this product truly works over time. must apply to old scars daily i do at bed and it gradually lightens and removes old scars. it really helps fresh scars too after scab is formed. i use on my body and face as spot treatment. it is heavy as a moisturizer but the purpose of this is to remove spots. thank you deciem gods and your price points are one of a kind,positive
"i feel like it is okay, been using this product for over months now. i do see some radiance right when i wash my skin and in the light. otherwise i feel like my skin looks the same in the natural light. it an affordable scrub cleanser and it does not brighten too much.",neutral
this product is really good! i was able to keep it on for the full mins. the product only burns if you have open wounds like cuts or popped pimples etc. but other than that the product does not burn like most claim. my skin was visibly brighter and physically smoother after product was washed off after the mins. i have oily skin and this product helps without stripping the oils out of my skin or making my skin too dry,positive
did not really feel like it was cleaning my face. lovely fragrance but not worth it for my acne prone and oily skin.,neutral

"great way to try before you buy the full size. i was not sure if i really needed this product in my skincare routine, or if it would work with my skin type. however- i have to say this is my new favorite part of my weekend skin care routine. the babyfacial works wonders. my skin is noticeably brighter and more radiant afterwords. i also apply this anytime before an event or going out, about an hour before makeup. it can burn upon first application, especially if you use any other types of retinols. i would cycle them out a few days before using this product just to make the experience better. this little bottle has also lasted me sooo long. i ended up buying the full size after this, and i still have not even touched it! the facial oil is great, and a definite must afterwords. even with oily skin, it does not lay too thick and you only need a small drop.",positive
"this tanner always makes me look yellowish- orange. i have tried applying it before moisturizer, after moisturizer, i have tried mixing the drops with my moisturizer before applying it to my face. no matter what i do this product does not work for me. if you want a bronzed goodness tan i do not recommend this product.",negative

"there are lots of things i like about this moisturizer. it is not scented, affordable, vegan, and caused no irritation on my sensitive skin. i think this is a good basic or starter moisturizer for people who are not looking for their moisturizer to plump, help texture or redness or do anything else other than moisturize. this dries down quickly and i did not feel a film on my skin that some people mentioned. but an hour after first application my skin felt dryitchy again and i noticed that the areas with texture became more pronounced after a week. i think this is best for younger people in high schoolundergrad or for this just starting out and with no other skin concerns.",neutral

made me break out and i do not have sensitive skin. you are better off using a more expensive retinol serum that will not irritate your skin. not worth the hype.,negative
i really like the josie maran argan oil so i had high hopes for this product. as many have commented it is a very thick oil that does not spread easily and tugs at the skin during application. also it has a very strong scent of lemon. lastly if you happen to get a little in your mouth while washing or rinsing your face it tasted terrible! i used it for three days and returned it.,negative
"best product for a glass skin on woman over. i am. i only use l ascorbic acid as vitamin c in am so i am not using this product to get my skin vitamin c. though, if you put make up on and want anything close to a glass skin or even without make up, omg this product does the job. it gives a glass skin not looking greasy at all and not feeling greasy. your skin will not be sticky at all. it also makes me look years younger. routine i clean my skin in am with steps korean way little gentle chemical exfoliant, then i use t.m....s vitamin c, then korean broad spf, then this wonderful serum from ole henriksen and then i add a light moisturizer on top. not too much. i then apply tatcha primer on my fine lines and pores minimal as possible, then a cushion korean make up with spf or nars radiant foundation. if you want even a more dewy look, use tatcha dewy skin cream as moisturizer instead a little-no need much or will be greasy, but not mandatory. you will look many years younger if you remain light and natural with your make up... please never discontinue this product!!! p.s this product is not good for people sensitive to fragrance as there is fragrance.",positive

"i normally do not handle peel pads that well since i have dry combo sensitive skin. i noticed as soon as i opened the jar that it had a slight clean scent to it which smelled nice. i opted to use it on my chin area first because i had a pimple that needed to be taken care of. then i waited days before using it on my entire face since my skin can get easily irritated with peel pads. after use, i did notice some minor redness on the area where i applied it but no burning. i do think i am better off with a more gentle exfoliator than these pads especially since you can use them everyday. maybe these would be great for combo to oily skin and those with acne.",neutral

"i found that this cream is extremely thick so i was using it as a night cream. if you have dry skin, it may be great for you. the reason i gave this stars is because it irritated my sensitive skin. also, be careful what product you use before it. i did a witch hazel face mask then used this cream and my skin got burns.",neutral
"le sigh. i feel a bit conflicted with this product. i love the ingredients and concept, and it certainly did not because my any issues. as someone with sensitive skin this alone is a win. but i also cannot say i loved anything about it. for reference, some other similar creams i have tried and loved are tatcha water gel, herbivore pink cloud, and all of the klairs creams. i really see results with all of those- they absorb quickly, calm redness, and leave skin soft and hydrated longterm. this one just did not achieve any of those things for me. i enjoyed using it- the texture is as you would expect, like a typical lotion and i appreciate that it is fragrance free. but for me personally i still woke up with redness, some flakes, and some oily areas.",neutral

"i tried this sk-ii facial treatment essence pitera recently and this is my review for the product. the first thing i did was check the ingredients, and i was disappointed to see it contains parabens. for a high end brand i really did not expect such low end ingredients and that was a huge letdown. this facial treatment essence is liquid like a toner. it is a clear liquid that you apply with a cotton ball or your hands. i know this is a staple and must have product for so many ladies and i wanted to like it but i felt like it did not do much for me and also felt like it dried my skin out a bit. i did not have a large enough quantity to see if there was any long term effects in how my skin reacted to if and whether it is anti-aging claims were effective, but my skin did feel soft and smooth while using this product and it glowed nicely. overall, i think this was a decent product and had no real problems with it, but due to the ingredients and quality i probably will not be using this again.",neutral

"this serum has a very comfortable feel. i like that it is cruelty free and clean at sephora. i could not tell from the ingredients list whether it is vegan or not, the ingredients are very chemical sounding- would have to research to see what they are derived from. it may help with light wrinkles, it is meant to be used under a moisturizer or with your makeup. i tried it under my powder makeup, and it was a nice base. the price is nice at. for ounce, so it is not a big commitment to try. i did feel the hyaulronic acid moisturizer i also currently use works better on my deeper wrinkles.",neutral
not as revolutionary as i hoped but an excellent moisturiser that feels good and improves my skin.,positive
unfortunately this has really burned my under eyes. maybe i used too much? it started to burn right on application and it is still uncomfortable minutes later.,negative
"i have been using this product for three years and it a must have for me. i have combination skin type and it prevents breakouts and soothes my skin, giving it a healthy and even look. results can often be seen overnight. it has a nice scent also.",positive
"this was okay. it did the job, but i have used better ones. there are ones you can buy, outside of sephora, where it is different sizes and works a tad better and is way cheaper.",neutral
i was excited to try this out for fixing dark spots whitening but while using it for quite some time nothing changed there was no difference.. normally when i apply toner it makes my skin feel cleaner but this one did not feel that way,negative
did not notice any dramatic change but made my makeup go on perfectly!,neutral
"very pigmented but no coverage! like literally none. buy the unseen. it is the same but a few dollars cheaper. i love the sunscreen, gave stars on unseen, but because this is marketed as pigmented, i give star. just go with unseen or cc cream if you actually want coverage.",negative
best. toner. ever. i absolutely love this stuff and will from now on be my go to toner. great for sensitive skin and rosacea prone skin!! i got it for free in my spring voxbox from influenster and i am so blown away by the quality.,positive
"holy grail toner! with it being winter and me having combodry skin i needed something a bit more hydrating, but not too heavy for acne reasons. this is not only on the more affordable side for how you you get, but it also is so soothing! i am forever a customer!",positive
considering i spent about on this after tax i thought it would really make an impact on my skin. it did absolutely nothing. a gel cream from cvs brightens and cleared up my skin more than this did. scam company.,negative
this is my first attempt at using direct acids and it has been super successful. this product was not too harsh and has definitely improved my skin texture on my forehead. my little bumps have gone down. i use this at night with the niacinamide and zinc as well. once i finish this bottle i think i will try the and my chin area has improved but not cleared up yet,positive
"i try a lot of cleansers since my skin is very picky and this one is one that went well in my condition. one thing that i love that is almost no fragrance and a little dot do the entire face and neck area and does not irritate. i love use it n the shower so i remove everything. least a lot, i have the travel size and use it everyday and for over months. worth the hype.",positive
so far amazing result did not make break up because i am used to using string exfoliations but if your not give it try for up to months i am sure it will work for you!,positive
"honestly i have not been using long enough to really see any results. i do feel that my skin feels softer, but i have noticed significant changes in fine lines around my eyes. i docked some stars because i believe this may be breaking me out.i just wanted to leave a tip for anyone else using this product. ha is a humectant and while intended to draw moisture from the surrounding into your skin, can actually draw moisture out of your skin especially if the climate is very dry. to prevent this, it must be sealed in with an occlusive heavier moisturizer. this could explain why some people are noticing dryness increasing or feeling like it makes them look older due to moisture loss fine lines can become more apparent.",neutral
very thick. it also created a burning sensation. tried multiple times will return.,negative
"i bought this as an alternative for the ordinarys vitamin c. i liked the fact that this product is a stable form of l-ascorbic acid but it is too concentrated. typically serums above are very irritating and this product is the grittiest, most irritating thing i have ever felt. especially if i have a small cut on my face and accidentally get a bit of this cream- it is the worst pain!! i find that mixing this product with their hyaluronic acid gives it a better consistency to apply on my face evenly. but i think lowering the concentration would help with irritation. because otherwise, it was a good product and helped with hyperpigmentation. i hope they really consider it because until then, i will just use their alpha-arbutin serum.",neutral
"gentle on my sensitive skin and does not dry my skin out. i have an oily t zone and i do wish it was a bit better with that, but that is my only complaint. price point makes it worth it!",positive
"i have combo skin, so this works well. i can get the hydration i need without having oil slick face.",neutral
"i used to old formula for years, loved it, loved keeping it in the fridge, loved the results, it was worth the price for me. this new version, you have to mix yourself, you get a little less, and then only of the product even came out. it is grainy and clearly the pump is clogged because i was only able to get product out for maybe a month. so disappointed because this is big money to drop to get of the product you bought. i will never buy this again. i guess i am on the hunt for a new vitamin c. so sad, i loved this product.",negative
"i agree with some of the reviews that the oil separates so you have to shake it before use. for some reason towards the end of the day, this really bothers my eyes unlike the supergoop unseen. although this value is better i would say if you have oily skin this might not be for you. it does the job with no white cast and great spf but it bothers my eyes too much to buy it again.",neutral
i have oily skin and was hesitant to try this product. i have been using it for about a month and i do like it! a little goes a long way!! the first time i used it i used too much and it left my skin feeling very greasy! so do not use to much! a dime size amount should be enough! i have noticed that my skin looks brighter! i will keep using!,positive
i have normal to dry skin and even i found this product so greasy. i will stick with layering moisturizer with another sunscreen.,negative
broke my face out immediately. like actually pimples the next day that took forever to get rid of,negative
this is a horrid waste of money.it was recommended by a sales person i wish i would have kept the box to return it.immediately after i use it my face is covered in acne! my face is extremely dry after using it then next morning my face is covered in oils.it has completely shocked my skin.absolutely do not recommend,negative
"i like this scrub, but find that it can be a bit abrasive. the scent is also very strong, which is not pleasant.",neutral
not a fan of the sunscreen scent in this product. only spf. nice packaging though,neutral
"i love this serum so much, except the fragrance. i really wish it did not have any. it is a bit of a bummer.",neutral
"i have loved every product i have ever tried from murad, and thankfully, this one is no exception! i have tried my fair share of acne treatments over the years, but this one takes the cake. it is a salicylic acid treatment that helps clear and heal deep acne, and i would definitely recommend this for anyone struggling with problematic skin. this was gifted by murad skincare.",positive
"this product is absolutely useless. it does not hydrate as it claims to do. i always need to applyi nother layer of moisturizer to make sure my skin is hydrated. after application, it dries out your skin. would not recommend it",negative
"i love the feel of this product, however, i have not noticed much of a difference. i will continue using it with the hopes that it will one day magically work for me.",neutral
"i usually use the littles set with lala included and love this brand, so when i saw they released a new trunk. i jumped on it. the trunk comes with this moisturizer instead and i am so sad to say this broke me out! i am obsessed with the whole line but will have to waste this full size and switch back to lala which worked great for me. i definitely recommend trying a sample size for a few days because most people seem to have great success with it. good luck!",negative
bought this mask based of the great reviews and price point. i love the way it made my skin feel after washing it off. so silky soft and smooth.,positive
"i received this product to try free from influenster. the first thing you notice when you open it is the smell. it is not unpleasant just very strong and a little more perfumed then i usually like for my skin care, but it does dissipate quickly. unfortunately since using it i have been breaking out like crazy on my forehead, but it has been doing wonderful things on my dry patches on my cheeks. all in all it is not a bad product just not necessarily suitable for my skin",neutral
"love the new hydrating noni glow sleeping mask from kora. i have been looking for a mask that hydrates without clogging my pores for the past few years. the laniege water mask was my go to mask in this area before discovering the kora mask but i think the noni glow mask leaves my face notably more supple and soft than laniege. about minutes after applying the noni mask, it sinks in so that you do not feel like its rubbing off on your pillow or sticky. i also did not notice any irritation although i typically have sensitive skin.after rinsing my face in the morning my skin feels soft and any dry spots around my nose especially in the winter have been healed. no more flakey spots! also love that it is organic and cruelty free. thank you kora! this will be my new go to gift for girlfriends birthdays.",positive
love that it has sunscreen with vitamin c great to moisturize dry skin but does not do anything if you have any acne or blemishes to cover up,neutral
"i am sure this is a great product for others, but with my normal to oily skin i thought this product was too thick and heavy. eventually it melted into my skin, but i prefer the tatcha water cream because its lighter and really blended well. if you have dryer skin i am sure this would be perfect! smells great and the texture is beautiful.",neutral
"i bought this in the mini size in order to sample it because it is insanely expensive for what is essentially a moisturizer. the mini was also very expensive for the amount you get. anyway, immediately, i did not like it because of the fragrance. it smells like cologne and is extremely strong. i am not especially sensitive to scents and this was too much for me. additionally, it does not feel moisturizing...at all. it does not apply very smoothly and feels matte almost immediately after absorbing into the skin, which is very quickly. finally, my face broke out. now, i am not certain it was this product as i was using a number of new products on my face, but the strong fragrance in combination with my sensitive skin suggests that this product could have been a contributing culprit. in any case, for the price, i did not find this product to be any better than the moisturizerprimer i already use that is cheaper. needless to say, i will not be buying the full size and i would not recommend it.",negative
"this is the ultimate toner when it comes to active ingredients to promote cell turn over. i started with the ren aha toner and it was good but then i found this gem for just a fraction of the price and i will never spend on another acid toner again. this acid gets rid of texture and white heads in just one swipe. i use it conjunction with the farmacy honey moon glow serum if my skin is misbehaving with texture, acne andor dark spots or with the cold pressed rose hip oil from the ordinary if i want to give my skin some rest. i bought it on december and it is almost june and i have not gone through half of the bottle yet. a steal and an awesome product. thanks to the ordinary for such an amazing line!",positive
the rose blemish booster made my skin feel so healthy and clean! i used this product every day constantly for days and i was so shocked with how beautiful my skin felt and looked!,positive
"wanted to love this, but after one use it separated into a runny greasy clumpy mess. no amount of shaking fixed it. totally disappointed.",negative
"i have used other brands hyaluronic acid, that were pretty pricey and i like this one better. for the price, i think it works wonders. i rather pay for the product then the packaging.",positive
it clogged my pores and caused me to have horrible breakouts on my forehead the day after.,negative
"i would give this serum a. if i could. i have a hate love relationship with this product so it is hard to really determine how many stars it is worth to me. it does its job, it hydrates my skin, it makes it feel supple and hydrated as soon as i apply it and of course, you cannot beat the price. but the formulation just sucks, it pills up and makes you look like you have been shedding once the product dries down. it does not take long to sink into the skin but by the time i get to work, i have to dust off the white pilling that is this leaves all over my skin and it makes me not want to use it anymore. i have put this in damped skin, on dry skin,after my toner and essence and it behaves the same all the tine. i have tried other more expensive hyaluronic acids and you can definitely see the difference in quality. i would recommend it only if you are willing to wipe off your face every time after application.",neutral
"i do not think this product agrees with my skin and that makes me so sad! after my morning routine wash, serums, moisturizer i apply this and it takes my skin from looking glowy to textured and ashy. i love the smell, the packaging and maybe if i had a different skin care routine, i would like it better.",neutral
ehhh it is ok. there bottle looks like it would have a lot in it but it seems to be mostly air. i would t buy this again.,negative
"i have sensitive combination skin with an incredibly oily t zone. this mask works great in getting rid of the oiliness without drying out the rest of my skin. not an easy feat for any skin care product. yes it does have chemical smell to it but honestly its not terrible, i have definitely had other masks smell worse. also the smell dissipates pretty much as soon as it starts to dry, which does not take long. another plus of this product it does not take forever. some masks recommend ten minute but we all know its more like. this one i can take off in- minutes and its not a waste of product. hence its become a regular part of my routine. i use it- times a week. if i am having a particularly oily week i follow up with a pore strip on my nose and i get so much more out than i normally would. overall it does what i need to do in a manageable amount of time so i definitely recommend.",positive
"i have been using this for about a month. it is nice and cooling and did seem to brighten my under eyes. however, when i put it on tonight it burned my eyes so badly. they started to water immediately and i had to take it off.",neutral
"smells amazing, face feels super clean and refreshed after use, does not dry out face, a little pump goes a long way!",positive
"this product is amazing!!! it melts every last drop of makeup off your face. i feel hydrated and clean, but not stripped after i use it. i do not feel like i have to put a moisturizer on after because it hydrates so well!",positive
i love this serum. it is my favorite. when my first bottle was done i decided to try beauty counter and pacifica to see if i liked it. and i am back to this. my eyes are brighter and my lines are diminished and it feels good on them. before i started using this i was beginning to get little lines under my eyes starting from the tear duct. i bought this and they have disappeared. i also like the vitamin c bright eyes by murad that i received as a sample. so now i will use this as my night time serum and the vitamin c as my morning. it just opens up my tires eyes so well. love murad products.,positive
wow- thick consistency so a little goes a long way. but it was very hydrating especially for winter weather and moisturizing. i have very oily and acne prone skin but it did not leave my face oily after a while.,positive
"as someone who struggles with dry skin and redness, a gentle but effective skin product is essential. i love how affordable this brand is. i will say that this product is hydrating but it does call my rosacea to flare and sting a little bit. it also leaves my skin feeling a little bit sticky.",neutral
it is a little thick so i do not recommend using a lot but i do use it after i use the honeymoon glow. this might work for dry skin girls who need a bit more oil to balance out the dryness in their skin.,neutral
"i received this as a complementary product for my honest review.i really enjoyed this moisturizer. having the sunscreen included helps combine two steps in my skincare routine. it does not break me out or irritate my skin, it hold up under the brutal florida heat and sun, absorbs quickly, accent dissipates quickly, is lightweight and my skin feels like it can still breathe, does not pil up under makeup, keeps my skin feeling balanced and moisturized and sunburn free",positive
works best when my skin is normal and not dry so it is more of a cream to use in the summer for dry skin but it felt nice to use,neutral
this is an amazing product. i used to have puffy eyes but no more! i would not recommend using it nightly if you are new to this product but if you start slowly and alternating with another eye cream you will see results.,positive
i was recommended this product by a sephora employee because i told her my concern was red blotches on my face. she said i had sensitive skin and highly suggested this product to help with that and told me i had the blotches because my face was not hydrated. since i have limited knowledge in this field i took her word for it and bought the toner. man what a disappointment. this toner has made me breakout more than the toner i was using before. it leaves my face way too hydrated and yet also sticky at the same time. the bottle is so pretty and the smell is wonderful but do not fall into the trap. i wish the employee told me about the smaller version first because i would have preferred to try something before committing to it. learn from my mistakes!,negative
smell was a bit too strong and it felt more gooey than refreshing for me. the ingredients are really nice though.,neutral
"when i first received it, i thought to myself i paid for this small thing. do not expect your getting a big bottle. can literally fit in the palm of your hand. when you sweat, it does slightly turn white not obvious unless someone is observing you. there are other sunscreens that give more product for cheaper prices. if you want to try it, go ahead but it is nothing amazing.",neutral
"i am relatively new to the chemical exfoliation game, but after trying others i found this to be much to strong. with only weekly use it did help with my skin texture, but left my skin feeling tight and dehydrated for days after. i have used this weekly for months now and my skin was not able to build a tolerance. at least it did not break my budget. would recommend the for dry skin but it is always sold out",negative
"really needed something that you do not have to apply to the whole face and these dots seemed appropriate. it only works half of the time for me though. i apply overnight and it only gets some of the pimple out and the rest is still there. need to apply- times to get rid of the pimple. i was getting the same result if i leave one dot for an hour or two and then apply the next one right away- one is not as powerful to clear one spot completely. i found a better and cheaper product on amazon, so i will not be repurchasing these again.",neutral
"the first day i used it i thought i was seeing my skin clear up. but after about a week my skin started to severely break out with white heads, black heads, and redness. i was worried it was my cleanser so i stopped using that-- since i have seen so many good things about this product-- and afternoon i stopped using this serum my skin cleared up in days. i am quite disappointed, but it probably just does not work for me.",negative
"ok, i wanted to love it...in theory i should love it. it has amazing ingredients. but the smell....i just cannot get past the smell. i am embarrassed to have it on my face when i am around others. i had read other reviews that mentioned the smell and thought it cannot be that bad...it is that bad. it is a shame because in theory this is great...but if you care about smelling weird for a while after applying, i would look at a different product.",negative
the only reason why i am giving a start is because it does not let me give none at all. i purchased this product a month ago because of some positive reviews posted here. used the cream for and did not saw any results the cream did not work at all. please do not buy this cream is not worthy at all.,negative
so bad that it irritated my face and made it soooo dry.. i feel actually i got more wrinkles because of the dryness.. it is very red around my eyes and swollen. i did not recommend it!,negative
this product was just okay. did not have any noticeable changes. while the jar is cute it is very impractical. you need the included tool to scoop out product and it is hard to keep track of. needed to keep jar and tool in the box so i did not lose it.,neutral
"sooooo let me start off my saying, i have always used alpha arbutin for every part of my morning and night routine- it is made my skin brighter and my hyperpigmentation has cleared up too. on top of that, i have really oily skin and this has somewhat helped me mellow some of the shine, so one day i had the brilliant idea to mix it with my foundation, which typically gets patchy throughout the day because of my skin type. what i did not expect is that when i got home, my foundation barely moved! i was so happy because i have tried many primers and none of them helped my foundation stay in place like this product did. i always mix it with my foundation now, just a few drops and i am good to go for the whole day i also use gel eyeliner and mix a few drops of this in there to avoid any creasing throughout the day, my liner has not moved!! i looooove this product. i would highly recommend if you have oily skin like me.",positive
"i received the dermalogica daily microfoliant complimentary from dermalogica sampling. i give it a. the dermalogica brand came out with a daily microfoliant. it is a brightening rice based powder exfoliant. it smoothes with papaya enzymes and salicylic acid. and it brightens with phytic acid from rice bran. per the package, it is a powder that you wet and lather and scrub your face with. it makes your face very soft while you are washing your face. once your face is dry it feels calmed and taut, not irritated and this product does seem to calm acne down. it is an all around good product. the one major fault is it smells like vomit. just my opinion.",neutral
"i wanted another item in a kit and this came with it. once i got it i was very pleased with the texture of it since i have oily skin and it seemed like it would not clog my pores. then...i turned it around and saw the ingredients. with lotions and creams you want them to be as nourishing and helpful for your skin as possible especially since these are products that are meant to soak into your skin so you want the best ingredients possible. avoid nourishing items that contain alcohols and synthetics. well this product contains harsh synthetic fragrances such as limonene, linaloo, and citronelle. these are known to cause sensitivity in the skin and are actually drying because they are related to citrus. why would a moisturizer have drying ingredients? and from other reviews i notice that this is not working for people. the ingredient list will tell you why. i love yttp and i am sad to see this clean, environmentally company using mainstream harsh ingredients in their products. if you want a nourishing cream i recommend the adaptogen cream they have. the ingredient list is much better. i emailed them letting them know my concerns and of this is a brand you love i urge you to do the same so they know what their customers actually want",negative
"please note that i have not used this long enough to speak to the effects. the reason i am not going to continue using this product is due to the formulation. this is a heavy silicone feel- which can be great at blurring skin. however, i layer many products in my routine and unfortunately this formulation will not cooperate with my other products. it begins to pill up no matter how much time i wait to apply or the order of application. there is a slight irritation after applying the product as well. i will be purchasing a different formulation of azelaic acid from another brand.",negative
"love love love, perfect for any skin type. i had acne and it immediately stopped when i started using this. does everything it promises..",positive
"i was so excited to recieve this in the mail, but my skin ended up having an allergic reaction to it. i am super upset because i have spent months perfecting my skincare routine. i had amazingly soft skin and no redness, but now i am back to square one.",negative
"new favorite oil cleanser. this is awesome because it works well as a cleanser on its own, or as part of a double cleanse routine. the scent is strange at first, kind of like warm oatmeal. but i guess that is to be expected! it is really gentle on my combo skin and has a little bit of scrubby bits which i really like. also, the price makes it really worth it. better than other, more expensive cleansing balms and oils that i have used dhc, hanskin",positive
"this was the first product i ever tried by sunday riley and it changed my skincare routine forever. i find that a good way of truly knowing if your skin improving is when your good friends comment on how your face looks without provocation to the subject. i had friends and loved ones all saying how great my skin looked, and when i first starting using it, it was the only product that i added in to my regular wash n go. fair to say it was the one working the magic! if you are new to face oils, this is the one to start with. if you want to know more about face oils, checkout stephanie nicole on youtube. she is got a great video that breaks down face oils the rest of her content is a as well. luna is great!",positive
"gimmicky- do not get this. it is a makeup company going into skincare throwing every active in a serum and touting the benefits on all panels of the box in rose gold lettering. it is heavily scented floralrose which is unnecessary for a serum and another red flag. sephora has great skincare products, but avoid this line.",negative
not the biggest fan. do not feel it is done much for me in about month of use. i have had to use such a small amount otherwise it pills up like crazy. it is moisturizing but i do not think it is helped with puffiness or dark circles. will not repurchase but i will finish it.,negative
first de product i tried. i received this in a sample size as part of my birthday gift from sephora. i do not have an opinion on de as a brand. this cream has an ok texture itself but after application the skin has a slightly tacky feel and does not feel moisturizing enough to me. suspect it also broke me out a bit but did not use it long enough for me to confirm as i just did not like how it felt on my skin. used up the rest of it on my boyfriend and it did not break him out and no moisturizer vs with moisturizer is not a good comparison so could not tell you how that went.,neutral
"i loved this product right away- simple step process, package. the glass step gently scrubs and does not scrape or hurt. it does just enough to get the dead skin off and give you that new fresh reveal feeling. gloss is the lightest smoothest gel ever and just glides on to give you a glow. having tried so many exfoliants and moisturizers over the years, this is the best!!",positive
love this product. i am late s with dry and sometimes sensitive skin. i have been looking for a great exfoliator....and i have found one. i have had this product for a month now and use it only to times a week. wow how great it makes my skin look after use and i do not end up with red blotches or super dry patches post use. i love this stuff.,positive

i been using this cleanser for more than a year now. love the cleanliness feeling it gave me and no breakout. the only thing that made i took off stars is the easy broken cap! i been having the same issue for all of the cleanser bottle.,neutral

"this glides onto skin like a super silicone primer and then gets greasier and oilier all through the day. i do not believe it has approved sunscreen testing because i see more brown pigmentation on my face since switching to this. i went back to laroche posay. i think goop is a good name for this product, without the super.",negative
its nice. sinks in pretty quickly. nothing special. very comparable to other more affordable ones.,neutral
i have puffy eyes due to sinus and regular morning puffiness. this helped somewhat but it could have been more effective if the eye patch was a different shape. it was awkward and did not really sit comfortably around my eye area to really get the full effect.,neutral
"let me start off by saying that i have acne prone combo skin and that i have been on accutane. i do occasionally get new breakouts but i did find that this particular toner gave me new acne. after about months of use, it stoped breaking me out and started hydrating my skin however, this did nothing for my blackheads that are on my nose. this leads me to believe that the bha and pha are not high enough for me. once i have a higher concentration toner to get rid of my blackheads, i will be repurchasing this toner to up keep my face so i do recommend it! it is a pleasure to use.",neutral
"i really wanted to like this cleanser, but i just cannot. it is much more viscous than i thought it would be, and it seems to dry me out more than anticipated. i was trying to get more clean at sephora products to try them, but this product is not it. it does not leave me feeling clean. i had to grab my other cleanser just to cleanse properly and rid myself of residue! as always, i implore everyone to try things for themselves, but go in knowing my experience!",negative
"very greasy, for my skin only acceptable for nighttime use. using for one month every night, and i see no difference in my skin at all.",neutral
"very strong fragrance that made me wonder if the ingredients are actually considered clean. when i asked about it in the shop, they confirmed that the scents are created with natural ingredients but i am very sensitive so this did not end up being a good fit.",negative
lovehate. love the way it tans and even clears and evens my skin tone. bigggg downside is if you have gel nails it will turn them orangebrown. i even made sure not to let it touch the nails but i guess washing your hands afterwards will get the oil on your nails. super annoying downside of this product otherwise i loved it.,neutral
"the first day i took it i was still very anxious and tired but the next few times i took these, i did feel more energized but i am not sure if it was the vitamins or not. sometimes it is hard to tell. these were gifted to me by moon juice.",neutral
"very dissatisfied with this product. it pills up horrifically, no matter what moisturizer or oil is layered above. also, it left giant dry patches on my forehead. not to be dramatic, but i have never dealt with dry patches like this ever i was on the verge of tears because my skin has never had this issue. absolute garbage- currently hoping some light exfoliation marula oil will do the trick to help. definitely love many of the ordinarys products. this is not one of them.",negative
it works pretty well... but the tube has like hardly any product in it i bought this less than months ago and i am already running out,neutral
simply an ok product. i was not overly impressed by it. this product dried out my face a little and made it peel. i have very sensitive skin so that probably did not help. i would say not a bad product if you have normal skin.,neutral
"a nice product i use a little bit after my toner, the only issue i have with this product is after it starts to try and i rub my face a little the stuff comes off almost like it is your skin peeling which i am not a huge fan of also kind of sticky after.",neutral
i do not think that this spray makes any difference. i tried it on one of my legs and left the other with no spray and my tanning results were exactly the same as far as staying power. it also has a strong smell that is overpowering. my tan still comes off very unevenly with the isle of paradise self tanners with this product.,negative
this product is magical! zits gone in the morning! i am and get breakouts sometimes that take a week to go away. well worth the money!,positive
this is a nice moisturizer. the packaging is gorgeous but i think that this is a little too heavy for me. i have normal skin and while it has sat well underneath my makeup i have other moisturizers that i enjoy using more. my mom on the other hand loves this and i will be giving this to her.,positive
"i was super excited for this product as i am a huge clinique fan but it was super disappointing! the smell is foul, like nail polish remover! i have super oily skin and the day after i applied this my skin was unbearably dry, skin was peeling off in flakes it got so dry. also it made my acne x worse for the month i used it. do not recommend",negative
lightweight and does not make my skin feel super right! comes off easily and makes my skin feel refreshed! no crazy smell either.,positive

"i was really excited for this but it is much too heavy for me. it just sits on my face like a mask and does not absorb. also, no matter how long i wait between products it always end up pilling, even after it is had all night to sink in. i like other tatcha products but this was a miss. i definitely prefer the water cream and will probably buy it again instead.",negative
"oh. my. gosh. any new-found holy grail!!! this cleanser is by far the best cleanser i have had in years! my face feels soooo moisturized yet so. incredibly. clean after using this. most good cleansers strip your face to remove all of the days gunk, but this cleans and adds moisture back. i suffer from acne and hyperpigmentation, and this product has helped control my acne so much that i can now focus most all my attention on my hyperpigmentation. phenomenal, tatcha-- stars! i did receive this complimentary, but it is still undoubtedly the best thing i have received.",positive
love love love this line! great product-- no breakouts!,positive
i did not notice any difference on my skin. i tried it with dewy products and matte. this did not make my skin look any better or worse. i had hoped it would make my skin look more dewy and radiant but it did neither.,negative
"not a fan of this product. got a sample size and will not be purchasing the full size. scent is a bit strong, but fades quickly. i found that i just cannot tolerate wearing a moisture mask while i am sleeping.",neutral
"oh my gosh this stuff is amazing!!! i got it as a review item and coming to this site, the only downfall i found is the price. but i get it! this cream is like velvet in my skin and it does not make my skin feel coated or greasy. my skin stays hydrated all day when i use this in the morning. i love it and need to order more! even for this price. i totally recommend it.",positive
amazing freebie from influenster thank you so much,neutral
"i am loving this product. i get regular facials at the spa, and i can say that the quality of the glass gloss is uniquely professional. i have been working this into my routine every other day and watching my face transform. i loved the chic packaging and super cute glass jars. it is compact and easy to travel with. i love the healthy glow i get from the glass exoliant. the gloss is my favorite part--silky smooth and ultra-hydrating. i would highly recommend this product. tip keep the additional lid on both products!",positive
"this has not done anything to my dark spots as described but perhaps i have not used it long enough. it goes on well, is absorbed quickly has a pleasant scent. however, i wish it was not in a glass bottle as i am often clumsy so considering the cost, breaking it would be a disaster.",negative
i was so excited to get this. i can tell when the color finally kicked in hours later because i could faintly smell that typical self tan smell. the color is great i did love that. it is a nice heathy glow but....for the older ladies who may have light age spots or do t have them this will bring them out or make them darker! i cleansed my face etc but could not believe how some spots turned darker and spots i never saw appeared so beware!!,neutral
"i was very excited to try this as part of my complimentary sample. however i was not super impressed, i felt like it just coated my face but did not actually absorb into my skin, i wanted to love it but it just was not for me, the sample was very small so maybe i just did not give it enough time",neutral
"very watery texture, i have been able to use it day and night with everything from vitamin c, retinol, niacinamide, ahas, and my skin has not reacted badly. super gentle",positive
"the formula of this sunscreen is amazing. it soaks into the skin well, it is slightly hydrating, and as the name suggests, you cannot tell it is on your face besides the nice glow you are left with. however, the smell is unbearable to me. i do not know if i got a bad batch, but it gives me a headache and the smell lingers. if it did not hurt to smell it i would repurchase. it is a good sunscreen, but not that good if you are sensitive to scents.",neutral
"i love applying this glowy, hydrating moisturizer from sunday riley in the morning time as it feels very lightweight on! it is definitely glowy but non-greasy its got a gel cream consistency to it that suits my combo skin nicely! it hydrates nicely, makes skin feel soft, and after a week of consistent use i do notice a few of my discolorations lighten a bit! i am optimistic that with continuous use this moisturizer will overall brighten, even out skin tone and firm skins appearance even more, which i am looking forward to! by the way, it is got a strong smell to it so people with a sensitive nose might not enjoy it. other than that, it is a great product!",positive
it was okay. it was kind of thick and did not smell that great,positive
"at first i thought i did not like this enough, but when a little over and hour passed, i notice like my skin was getting rid of black heads, it is like it cleaned them out. i usually have a very hard time removing them, i usually need a needle, but after i used the mask it was sooo easy. at first i felt like it hydrated my skin, but then...it felt a little drier. i was scared because i felt a cooling sensation in my skin and some products that feel like that burn my skin and this did not. overall this did good. i could even get this again just to unclog my pores.",positive
"i use this nightly either before or after my. tretinoin and i can definitely tell that my skin, particularly my neck is more firm in just a few uses. i think this is definitely much more firming and useful than the plain buffet serum. i have been using high end skincare for several years and i am very picky about what i still include in my routine. vitamin c, strong aha, egf, pdrn look these up, you need them!, tretinoin. and this amazing serum! i know it is more expensive than the used ordinary serum but it is totally and worth it!",positive
"i like this. i can have pretty sensitive skin but i do not find it stings much, just a little but wears off very quickly. i also do not mind the texture. cannot say i notice a difference in my skin but it was cheap so i cannot complain",positive
great product! i had problems with redness and acne prone skin for awhile now. this is the best product to fix that. i apply it after using the ordinarys hyaluronic acid- it works great,positive
"this cleanser does a good job cleaning my face and cleaning off eye makeup as well, which is a major plus for me. the texture is nice, the packaging is nice. the only issue i have with it is the smell, but that is individual. i would recommend this cleanser if someone is looking for a good cleanser for both face and eyes, if the smell is not too off-putting to them.",positive
"i loved this product at first. the texture is lovely, it moisturizes well, and my skin felt soft and plump. i thought i would found the one until i started noticing little pimples forming on my forehead, cheeks, and around my mouth. it is hydration and the application feels fantastic, so i might recommend this for people with skin that is very dry and not acne prone. a word of caution about using this around your eyes it can make your eyes burn like crazy. i do not have sensitive skin around my eyes but, for whatever reason, this stuff stings",neutral
"this does a good job at removing makeup, eye make up is a little harder to remove but it does the job. i definitely feel like i need to used another cleaner after though because it leaves a residue on my skin. i will say it had a good price point though.",neutral
"just put the sample size orchid facial oil on my face....and wow! i do not know if it will improve anything, but the fragrance pours out of the sample envelope instantly upon opening gardenia i believe. it still smells fantastic it is been a little over five minutes, but i feel the aroma will last for a long time. unfortunately would not be able to wear most days, as a frequently visited relative is allergic, but i love the aroma! here is hoping it makes my skin look great too! rating is just for the aroma..haahaa",neutral
"i am very disappointed by this product. i started using it before i got a pimple that had left me with some hyperpigmentation... i was hopeful that it would minimize the hyperpigmentation as i used it religiously for months... but nope, no improvement, no prevention. the pink bonnet picture is the before.",negative
"this made me break out. it also gives my skin a weird drying sensation. thankfully, i only got this as a sample.",negative
i got the day sample of this and it is just ok. i would not spend the bucks for it when i could buy better anti aging creams. i do however love her minute facial mask and have repurchased several times. and can we please stop with these annoying influencer reviews.,negative
i got this as a gift and it gave me acne. i really do not like the texture. i stopped using it about days later after my breakouts began before this i had clear skin.,negative
not my favourite!!!!!!!!!! not going to buy it again!!!!!!!!!,negative
"this did miracles for my skin! since the formula has changed, it does nothing! why would they do this?! i will not repurchase unless they change it back. sad day for my skin.",negative
"great toner, stings a little bit and not a huge fan of the smell but it does work to make my skin cleaner",positive
"better than not using an essence i guess? the scent is definitely like an old sharpie marker and i do not think it works as good as the tatcha one, in my opinion. i definitely have into the hype. i would try something else before this one.",neutral
"i wanted to try this as a less expensive alternative for my normal cleaning oil but i would rather have spent more dollars to avoid this experience. squeezing out the product was scarring on its own but this stuff stinks!! does it smell like oil? yes. but like... this is a bit wrong!! it was a bit too tacky to rub in comfortably. when i rinsed my face it was uncomfortably still oiled... it did not even get off cheap mascara nicely, even after double cleaning and toning with a cotton pad i still feel like i did not wash my face well. this product is very silly. its not too expensive but even cheaper cleansing oils i have used before worked better. i feel like a fool for buying this.pros nonecons feels and smells icky, barely works, unpleasant to rub on skin, upset me.my perfect cleansing oil is neogen cica cleansing oil. in the past i used kracie olive cleansing oil if you live near a japanese grocery store do not pay dollars like shein is trying to make you do. its an honest cleaning oil. miss inkey list oat cleansing balm ruined me",negative
"i have oily skin, so i am always on the lookout for a good moisturizer. i was excited to receive a biossance voxbox which had the squalane omega repair cream in it. i like the packaging and it felt luxurious. i was also happy to see that it is vegan, cruelty free, nontoxic, paraben free, and peg free. the cream is really rich and does not leave my face greasy. i mainly used the cream at night after cleansing my face. it made my face feel very plump, soft and hydrated. sadly, after the first night of testing out the cream, my face started to break out. the only thing that i did not like about the cream was that it smelled bad, even though on the package, it says it is fragrance free. i will not be using this repair cream again because i cannot handle the scent.i received this product complimentary for testing purposes",neutral
"this is the best self tanner i have ever used, i have used a lot then got into isle of paradise then started with the dark tanning water this is a million times better in comparison to the water. you do not need to layer, just one application and you are dark, it dries super fast and is not easy to get off lol which i love. this is high quality stuff",positive
"absolutely a no no for me. first, it irritates my eyes so baaaad! and that is the first reason i used balm cleansers, because i used makeup everyday and my eyes are always my focus point. even for a no makeup type of day, mascara and something in my lids are my go to. back to this product, do not eliminate all my mascara and i do not used water proof, always live my eyes red and i have to go back with several layers to removed all my makeup and i do not wear a ton. in the rest of my face, is a meh product, leave a feel that i do not care because i do wash my face with another cleanser to eliminate everything. the other thing for me, was the smell. is pure oil smell. if you do not care, go for it. for me, my all skincare process is a spa type of feeling, and this smell ruined the vibes. plus, i live in ca and in a day that was like degrees, this stuff started melting all over because, again, is pure oil. so, hard pass!",negative
i used the whole thing and did not really notice a difference. it kept my eyes hydrated for sure but it also made my eyes watery.,neutral
loved this! the packaging is super cute! the smell is amazing! makes my skin feel wonderful! keeps my face hydrated all day! definitely recommend.,positive
i love the smell and the texture. i am a huge ole fan. the only thing is that is may be causing some break outs. not sure if it is causing or just purging the bad stuff. looking forward to continuing to see if i can use this instead of retinol!,neutral
has eucalyptus?? why which is not great for sensitive dry skin. if it did not have this i gross t it would be amazing. as soon as i put it on it burners with that mint feeling. so sad.,negative
"i am pale but i got mediumdark because i am impatient and wanted to look tan with one use. if you want a more gradual and lighter than, i would recommend the lighter shade. i liked mediumdark on me because i did look tan with one use. the tan did not look unnatural. it faded nicely. just be sure to rub this in well and not to miss any spots, as it goes on without color. this is nice because it does not stain your bedsheets, but do not rush when applying this because you do not want to miss a chunk of your leg or any part of your body, really. the mit is nice because you will not get excess product on your hands. this stuff is pricey, but works well. i do not have any complaints about the product.",positive
"this is a really good serum, but it is not worth the price unless you are willing to pay. they have others out there that are great. it did not do much for my skin at all!",neutral
i got to sample this product from pinchme happypincher for free and i was excited because it is my first time trying it out. and i liked the size of bottle. i got because i got to test it out for a long time. i applied it as is said before of after you go to sleep but i did it before i went to sleep then wipe it off using warm water right when i woked up for work. i love how it has natural ingredients plus after the wash your face feels so soft and moisturized. i loved it. it worked good for my skin type it is combination. plus i need this this it is cold right now and i have to go outside to go to work so the moisture protected my skin from this cold weather.,positive
i like this much more than the original! i notice a little more softness with this which helps for my skin not to strip it or make it feel dry... i would not repurchase the original as it did not do much for my skin type but i would definitely repurchase this to use for my exfoliation nights!,positive
"it does the job, after applying several times. but it over dries the spot where it was applied.. well it actually burns the skin.. trying to not use it that much. only applying it overnight from now on..",neutral
"wanted to like this but it was not moisturizing enough, could not get rid of flaky dry skin on my forehead. moved to farmacy and so much better for me",neutral
"i received this product for free for testing purposes fron influenster. i was so excited to add it to my skincare routine. i have tried the dewy mist from tatcha and absolutely loved it, so i was certain i would love this product, too! i have very dry skin and live in a very dry climate, so i am always looking for products that will brighten and hydrate, as well as even out my skin tone. i used this product morning and night for about four weeks and am sad to report that i did not see the results that this product promises. my skin tone has not improved and my skin is still lackluster. it feels nice on the skin and makes the skin look great within the first minutes after application, but dulls almost immediately. i am not sure why i have not seen any improvement in my skin. i enjoyed the smell, but will not be purchasing this in the future.",negative
"i got this as a sample and i loved the smell so i bought a the trial size from a gift set. i do like the cream!! i usually use the tatcha cleanser and am used to a pea sized amount. i needed to use- pea sized drops to cover my face which was half the bottle! this product caused my face physical pain and left my skin with dry patches, you can see- big one in my it in myphoto! the product also pilled up on my face and felt abrasive instead of exfoliating. i do not recommend this product!",negative
i loved the texture of the product how easily it absorbed into my skin. i just did not feel like i got the results i was used to with my higher end retinols. if you are on a budget do not have major concerns you will probably like this!,neutral
this mask was very surprising for me. when i opened it up i noticed a light strawberry candy scent. unlike some masks that do not smell like they should i was happy to smell the sweet strawberry scent. i kept it on for minutes and when i removed it i noticed hydration and a light glow to my skin. i have been dying to try it since i noticed it launched. definitely one i would love to try again.,positive
"this oil was okay, not the best but not the worst. it did not break me out but the smell was really strong. if your sensitive the fragrance, you are not going to like this. it also felt a little heavier than i would for my combo skin but if your skin is dry and dehydrated it might be perfect.",neutral
massive breakout after the third day. definitely going back to sephora.,negative
"the case started to break since the first time i tried to use, i tried to use it anyway but continued breaking and the dispenser is not working anymore. also, i expected something with less smell.",negative
the feeling of having it on for- hours sucks. it is a gross feelings to wait it out. i could not take it anymore and left it on for hours and still got nice results. it is a bit of an oily feeling.. overall it gives me a glow but it can be kind of spotty so be careful. but definitely one of the best self tanners i have tried yet. will be buying again,positive
leaves my skin oily and extremely tacky. does not absorb and smells horrible,negative
"made me break out really badly would not repurchase, and unfortunately will not be finishing the bottle i bought.",negative
"my skin felt thick, heavy and slightly itchy. no freshness or anything that a product w those ingredients should make you feel.",negative

"this product is really heavy, thick and has a strong fragrance. i used it for a few days and my face felt soft and supple! until i started breaking out is when i stopped using it. nothing else in my skincare routine has made me breakout this. this was not for me, it was a bit too heavy for my face. recommend if you have really dry dehydrated skin! i received this complimentary from influenster for reviewing purposes.",negative
hands down my new favorite skincare product- maybe from any brand? very noticeable difference in my skin texture after less than a week of x daily use. it is like a serum and a toner in one. love,positive
"complimentary from herbivore botanicals.it is a nice, lightweight and viscous serum that hydrates and does not leave a sticky feeling. my skin feels instantly refreshed and drinks it up. however i have other serums that i like more. i would not purchase it.",neutral
i do not love it. it is moisturizing but the texture does not spread easily. i always wake up the next day with one or white heads after using this.,neutral
did not do anything for my skin. i do not know what else to say. i have used a few ahabha treatments and this one by far is the least effective. it did not because stinging or peeling but it really did not do anything either. i am not happy with the price for the results.,neutral
"this has become one of my top moisturizers. this one heals my barrier when for some reason, my skin isfeels irritated. it is kind of pricey but it is worth every penny. my skin is combo.",positive
i honestly could not tell you if this works because the several times i have used it i have had to wash it off. the price is great but for me the smell was so bothersome that i could not leave it on.,negative
"the youth extending spf is probably my favorite sunscreen i have tried so far! it has a light texture, but feels very great on the skin! no greasy feeling, sets as a matte! it does not sting around the eyes, and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all. in love with this product!!!",positive
"this is wonderful!!! i love it. it does have a thick consistency like vaseline and you have to double cleanse. to remove it completely. however, it melts your full face of makeup effortlessly. for the price point i am all in!",positive
kind of is blotchy on the skin... i mix it with moisturizer. does this happen to anyone else?,positive
"i was so excited to see a glowy sunscreen product because i currently layer a glowy product on top of my spf, so i thought i might eliminate a step. unfortunately the formula does not work for me--it is heavygreasy feeling, irritating, and the reflective particles highlight texture rather than blur it. if you are used to the more elegant asian and european sunscreens with newer filters, you are going to hate this too. it just does not look nice--it does not blend well, the shimmer gets stuck in my facial hair and dry areas. i was just going to continue to use it up anyways since i cannot go to a store to return, but it irritates and burns the crap out of my skin if i leave it on too long likely one or all of the organicchemical sunscreen ingredients breaking down and becoming unstable. overall it is a hard no from me, and i would recommend saving your money.",negative
did nothing for me but make a dent in my bank account.,negative
very harsh on my skin. extreme irritation around nose and chin area.,negative
"this broke me out horribly until i started applying it while my face was still wet, and pairing it with a rich moisturizer such as the cerave moisturizer, the one in the tub. it has a high amount of alcohol in it, which i think is what broke me out, increased texture, and dried out my face. alcohol destroys the skins natural moisture barrier. my normal moisturizer just could not keep up with it, but once i switched that my face is looking pretty good now. not sure if that is because of the lactic acid, but we will see once i run out.",neutral
"i have been using this product for about two weeks now, and i have noticed the bumps on my skin have been disappearing!",positive

water-light consistency and rubs into matte... but it did not moisturize my skin and i was hoping this brand would produce a less sunscreen smell- but just not the product for mei prefer coola. complimentary from paulas choice in return for my honest opinion... which this is,negative
i recently tried the kiehls powerful-strength dark circle reducing vitamin c serum. i have enjoyed using this serum daily for about two weeks. it has reduced the dark circles around my eyes somewhat. i love that the formula is not too heavy and that it contains vitamin c which has been shown clinically to reduce dark circles. i will continue to use this in hopes of seeing even more improvement with my dark circles.,positive
"i have use this product for a little over a month now and still, i have not noticed any differences, slight or drastic. i am used to freshs rose hydrating eye gel cream, so maybe that chilling feel and slow absorption made me feel like that worked better, but i am not seeing what is so grand about this one. giving stars because i have not seen a negative impact, so it does not deserve but i do not get the same moisture i did with my former eye cream. maybe i will see a change when i try something new.",neutral
"honestly i used it for a month now, i do not hate the smell, it smells like it s not using any artificial ingredients to try to make it smell better, it smells natural, which i do like. but the only down side for this brand, not just for this item, this brand seems to not like to make their product looks more high class.. the bottle looks cheap, and sometimes you might squeeze it too much because the bottle itself are so soft and hard to control how much it come out. when i first used it i accidentally squeeze so much out... very big waste and it happened few times. otherwise, it was good, i use it after my face treatment, dose not damage my skin at all.",positive
"the pros after. months of use, i have indeed noticed a reduction in the lines on my decolletage. and a little of this non-greasy cream goes a long way.the cons no difference to the lines or firmness in my neck, which was disappointing since that was my main goal. posting a before and after pic in case it is helpful. for this price, i will not repurchase.",neutral
"i love this product! first, it is vegan and natural. way to go st. tropez! the scent is great, and the spray bottle makes it an easy application. lotions are too messy. the color looked natural for me, and no streaks.",positive
"i love this product! i can see some people have said that it turns orange, but this did not happen with me. i have very fair skin and i used only a small amount of product. i tapped it into my skin rather than vigorously rubbing my skin is very sensitive. it was not orange at all. i put a light foundation overtop and it was beautiful. it had a dewy finish and stayed all day. it reduced redness, smoothed my skin, and felt hydrating. i think if you are on the fence about it, give it a try and see if it works for you!",positive
"i was honestly a little hesitant to buy this because of how trendy and cute their marketing packaging is, but it was a great reminder to not judge a book by its cover! i added this into my morning routine about months ago and i have seen a stunning difference in my skin! it is glowy and bouncy now. i showed my sister a before and after and her jaw visibly dropped. to be fair, i do no suffer from a lot of dark spots so i cannot comment on that. i got this because vit-c is supposed to help with texture and i have seen improvement in texture but the glowing skin is what will keep me coming back!",positive

"serum is gentle and absorbs into skin, but did not really notice a difference.",neutral
received this complimentary from la mer. definitely for dry skin types whereas mine is between combination and normal. i am sure it may be holy grail product for dry skin. although i still cannot justify the hefty price tag for such a small amount.,neutral
"this moisturizer definitely helped to brighten my skin, however it is just not moisturizing enough. i find that i have to apply a lot or apply it more than once to get some moisture.",neutral
"expensive and does not even do squat for my. when you st take it off, it appears to look smooth. give it a few minutes, and it looks like normal before you even use the product. i have used it twice for two weeks. also, they do not even give you enough to make any real judgment.",negative
absolutely love this moisturizer. i have looking for the best moisturizer since forever and i finally purchased this one and found it!!!,positive
awesome! full coverage with only one little pump of the bottle. i am in love with this! and it has changed the appearance of my skin for the better,positive
works great to cover up my redness. i have some redness from sensitivity issues and from some breakouts. the heaviness of the product is the only thing i do not like. very thick and i prefer to use this when i am staying home. i do absolutely love that it is a spf so i finish my routine with this! i did receive this product complimentary through influenster!,neutral
"wanted to love this, and had a good experience at first when i started doing any skincare routine at all. a few upsides are that it is fragrance free, does indeed relieve itching, and makes your tattoos pop nicely. unfortunately, after a while i noticed that it is not hydrating, even when used on wet skin although that helps and it tends to make my face puffy after i use it at night. it feels a little greasy and sits on top of my skin without absorbing much or at all. i get better results using ceraves moisturizing cream to be honest. would use maybe if you have bouts of itchiness and already have a better moisturizer on.",neutral
these such a great addictive to my skincare routine! exfoliating is so important and this really does the job well. it is not a harsh scrub but it works very well and definitely refreshes my skin. i use it every days or so.,positive
used the whole treatments after purchasing and using the day trial in conjunction with the oz. vitamin c serum that they have. only saw changes in texture. did not see any changes in my fine lines or hyperpigmentation brightening. i would not recommend this line. i used the dennis gross products every day to give it a fair shot but i would not spend again on this line.,neutral
a sales associate recommended this moisturizer to me when i wanted to try something new. it is not awful but it feels oily and my skin was still quite dry after much use. i thought it might take a bit to get used to and so i kept it and figure i would finish out the rest. after months i saw zero improvement in my skin. it did not seem to make my dry skin any better and i got pimples more frequently than i had ever before.takeaway it is not horrible but certainly not worth the money. i will stick to my usual moisturizer.,neutral
i must be using the product wrong because every time i used it i would remove lash hairs and eyebrow hairs. i got the pts trial and ended up tossing it because i hated that it tugged out eyelashes and eyebrows. i am sure it is user error but i decided i am not a balm cleanser.,neutral
"everytime i applied this product, my skin was definitely brighter and it reduced redness. but after one week, little red bumps and blackheads appeared on the t-zone. i thought it was purging still not so sure about that. i just applied this on the t-zone because i have combo skin and it is the area where i want to see some results for my pores. so, for the appearance of the pores and the oiliness, i do not think it helped.",neutral
"i love biossance. i want to say that i love this product, but i am just not seeing a ton of results. it is got great texture, and it feels great going onto my skin, but i do not really see the hype right now. my skin is not more plump than usual. i will keep using this and see if it just takes time, but right now i am not blown away.",neutral
"i received this product as a free sample. however, i do not pick to receive sample size products due to being hard to write a review. i recess small sample size and it was not enough of the product to leave a review and be honest. so i cannot recommend the product and be honest.",negative
"this is a very gentle cleanser which leaves your face feeling clean. i really liked using this cleanser because it has no fragrance. this cleanser did not irritate my sensitive skin. i did receive this product as a free sample for testing purposes. i would not have thought to try this product had i not received it for free, however i am very happy i did! i would buy again in the future.",positive

"if you have silicon you cannot put it as one of your first steps in your skin care after cleansingexfoliating, toner then vitamin c.. this is thick so you would have to use it ver your moisturizer which is dumb and you are not getting any benefits so its just a waste.. it literally feels and acts like a primer.",negative
i was so excited to try this and although my skin felt hydrated it is super thick so clogged my pores instantly. i broke out days after trying this. but would still recommend for dry non acne prone skin,neutral

"it removes makeup well and does not leave behind any residue or a sticky feeling which i like and it also does not sting my skin. i am also a big fan of the clean by sephora stamp! i rated it stars only because of the price and you can find cheaper micellar waters which is all i would use this for, i do not see any noticeable skin care benefits from it or think it is worth the price.",neutral
"i have sensitive combdry skin. i used it for my night wash and woke up with raised red skin. i used it again that morning and it was harsh and drying. which is ironic cuz it is meant for combdry skin. i stopped using it and the next morning, the raised red skin went away. this was the only new product i tried the two days i started using it.",negative

"i was skeptical at first about this product being that it is oil and i sometimes have oily skin. after using this for over a year, i can honestly say it has improved the overall look, tone and feel of my skin. i love it. it soaks in and makes my skin so soft. also helps repair my scars and any blemishes i had overnight. when comparing to other night masks or night repairs, it was worth the price and lasts a long time.",positive
i was a bit nervous to try this moisturizer as i tend to have oily skin so i was worried about any kind of greasy after feel. the product is a cream but it is actually very light and absorbs quickly and easily with no residue. it feels very hydrating on my skin. i like that it contains niacinamide and helps to brighten the skin while also hydrating. freeproduct,positive
"it is good and i like the way it hydrates my face and the product itself is well built especially the way you can make smoothies. however, i would not say that it is worth the price, i am sure there is better.",neutral
completely melts all my makeup away. super gentle on my sensitive skin. my go to makeup remover.,positive
"i do not get it. this is super oily. no matter how much i mix it it is just a puddle of oil. alone it looks ok in covering redness but as soon as i put foundation on, it is melts off because of the oil in this product. i have tried to use less, let it dry for a while- nothing helps",negative
"it seemed to work really well the first night and my skin was soft and glowy the next day. but then the acne started! i broke out with this and had to stop it before things could calm down. i like the smell and how it would make my skin feel, but it just was not a match for me",negative
"my new favorite cleanser. i have been using it consistently for about a week, and my pores look so much clearer and smallersmoother. i have combo skin, so i concentrate this on my t-zone and it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped....and the packaging is gorgeous actually shocked this is only. it is a beautiful solid glass bottle that looks great in my shower",positive
"i bought this a few weeks ago and i absolutely adore this as a day serum. for the price, it works better than a majority of the expensive serums out there. i highly recommend it if you are on a budget. the only critique i have is the scent. perfect if you are not big on scents because it is not really scented but i find it does have a slight scent as i am very sensitive to scents.",positive
"this is a weird little cream. it is supposed to be a skincare project but it just looks and feels like i am putting on a layer of beige cream on my face. is my skin sucking up this product up? or is this product sitting on my skin? from the looks of it after trying it twice, it just sits on top. i showed my fiance it and he said i look like a ghost. i have pretty fair skin but i am not related to casper. pass on this one.",negative
overrated. this broke me out and sat on my skin. it smells nice and felt great but that is about it. it did not give me the radiant or smooth results promised and i think it clogged my pores. be careful.,negative
"got this for my boyfriend who has oily sensitive skin. he said it burned, plus the oil kept coming back so its not even worth the burn. the hunt for the perfect oilysensitive skin toner continues...",negative
"this really gives my skin the hydration it needs, without leaving my skin oily. my skin feels softer after helps blur out any dark spots or hyperpigmentation on the skin. i use it every morning and night.",positive
"so, like some others had said, this burned my face the first time i used it on freshly washed skin. that is because i have sensitive skin and i just went for it which i should not have, but i needed to know what the hype was. after burning my face only a couple times lol! my face adapted and the benefits started to glowwwwww. my grandparents asked me if i was pregnant because after using this spray, i used the protini resurfacing serum and then a little of my foundation and that was the moneyyyyy!. my skin looked so flipping good. i sprayed this again ontop of my foundation as a setting spray and it was just insane how dewy my skin looked. do not be discouraged. you are literally spraying beer and kombucha on your face, it is going to freak out a little. ease into it and you will not be dissapointed. my grandma and my mom purchased this after using it on their faces.",positive
awesome when used in conjunction with the f-balm. absolutely love it.,positive
"i am fairly pale and self tan every summer because sun is just not great for anyone in large quantities. this one goes on pretty clear, which makes it tricky for someone who has not self tanned before to see the guideline. however, for experienced self tanners it is super easy. it develops in- hours and you do not need to rinse it off, and is okay to use on the face too. it fades golden, not orange which i love and stay on well moisturized skin for about a week before i need to fully scrub the remnants off.",positive
"pretty good new launch from herbivore botanicals. very soothing eye cream that not only hydrates and moisturizes, but also provides firming effect. i like how it feels on my skin, definitely recommend trying.",positive
"i got a free mini bottle of this and used it for about a week. i did not notice any difference in my skin compared to my normal aveeno cleanser, and the latter is much cheaper so i do not think this is worth the price. i did love that a little goes a long way, so if you are on the fence, get the mini and check it out--it will last longer than most samples!",neutral
i recieved this product complementary from influenster to try and review and omg let me tell you that i am in love! i noticed a difference in my skin and a glow after just two uses! i highly recommend trying this product and letting it speak for itself and steal your heart all on its own.,positive
"i have tried this product exactly once. i added it as the second step to my daily routine last night and this morning i woke up with dry, flaky patches all over my face. i will not use this again. i have sensitive combination skin with eczema on my nose. i would never recommend this to anyone with my skin type.",negative
"i do not like this as much as their cherry vitamin c which i think they discontinued in favor of this one. this product stung my skin at first, but overall my skin barrier was struggling so i definitely do not think this is good for sensitive skin folks. i have worked my way up to using it to every three days right now, and my skin does look brighter and is touchably softer! just need to go slow! i feel very medium about this unfortunately. gifted by farmacy beauty.",neutral
this is probably my th time buying this baby. it is my favorite most for a natural dewy look. it will not set you makeup or make it last any longer i am going to but it makes everything settle so naturally and you look healthy by and glowy all day.,positive
"used this toner in conjunction with the essence. they just did not work effectively for my combooily dehydrated skin. i do believe the toner hydrated my skin- a bit, but my skin texture actually worsened some. i may be trippin, but one or both of these products seemed to block the absorption of my other skincare products. so, no. i will try the fab ultra toner next...",negative
"i have been using this for almost exactly months. i was liking it okay, other than the stinging and hardboiled egg scent. i have not had one single zit for that time, the longest stretch of my whole life, but i think that is more related to using zinc pyrithione soap for perioral dermatitis at the same time a complete miracle product. i have to discontinue this moisturizer now because even after more than plenty of application, my skin is visibly dry, with the white skin dust and everything, as if i am not wearing any moisturizer. my skin just guzzles it and is still parched. i have to really load up on my second layer, versed sunscreen to rely on it as the moisturizer, and it is not very helpful at that either-- going to take the plunge for first aid beauty intense hydration and see how that works. inkey peptide has also offered no plumping, and forehead lines are accentuated. i think climate is important here... i am in a high, ultra-dry, wildfire-smoke climate. i think if i lived in florida and was drowning in humidity, this product could be excellent.",neutral
i was looking for an eye cream that would moisturize the dry skin around the eyes. this cream has gel like consistency and it does minimal basic job at hydrating. wish it was more nourishing.,neutral
i am obsessed with this eye cream. the consistency almost turns water-like when putting on the skin and it gives the most amazing highlight. a little goes a long way- this tub will last forever.,positive
"even if this product is effective, i am not inclined to use it because of how sticky it is. makes your entire face shiny and ruins makeup. can only use at night time but i do not like having separate product for night and morning. i do not like any of the ha products from the ordinary for this reason, unfortunately.",neutral
"i used a cleanser that was new to my routine, and it was fine at first, but it started stripping my skin. lucky, i have this gem to try to bring back my normal skin and wow!!! i underestimated this stuff. at little goes a long way. it starts solid but breaks down to an oil deliciousness. dehydrated dry will love this!",positive
"i like the benefits it is said to have and that it is easy to use, but it does not seem to be doing anything for me... except causing my skin to breakout. i am wondering if it will be a better winter skin treatment when it is more dry, because the heat mixing with it might be causing the breakouts, but as of right now, it is just not doing anything for me.",neutral
"since i have been using this product, i have not seen much improvement of my dark spots but it has made my skin so soft and has improved the texture of my skin. it has a light, refreshing scent, nothing too overpowering. i definitely recommend for improving skin texture and will continue to use it myself. as others mentioned, it may work best to prevent newer dark marks. i did receive this product free for my honest review.",positive
"i received this as a sample from influenster and although it is a decent serum, i think it is extremely overpriced. it works just as well as other serums i have bought for-. it absorbs in my skin quickly and makes me face smooth but i have not seen any results really",neutral
"i have another brand of vitamin c serum for many years. but this past year i discovered sunday riley good genes and fell in love. i have been adding new products and this was the latest addition.the c.e.o vitamin c rich hydration cream is absolutely the best c i have ever used. fast absorbing, no greasy feel on face use this as my first layer under my good genes.",positive
"so far i have loved every la mer product that i have tried and this treatment lotion is no different. i love how it makes my skin look glowy and feel soft, and mostly, i love the luxurious experience it provides.",positive
"i really like this face wash but the smell is quite strong. i do not notice it lingering on my face after washing it off, but it is quite artificially clean and fresh smelling. will use it up but likely will not bug again. and it is a massive size so i will have it for a while.",neutral
i like a natural radiant look. i find most powder highlighters look nice in photos but emphasize my fine lines. this is the only product i have found that give that dewy complexion that is not greasy looking or have a fake strobed shine.,positive
these feel really great to wear especially in the morning. the cooling effect i put them in the fridge is especially nice if you feel like your eyes are puffy. but probably just as effective to put cucumbers on your lids. would not buy again.,neutral
"using this feels like i dunked my face in a vat of butter, no matter how much i try to rinse after using. gave it a few chances but always ended up using another cleanser right after to get rid of the fatty residue feeling. it does get rid of makeup fairly well and i guess technically does not dry out my skin, but neither would basting myself in lard so not sure what that is worth.",negative
"i am not usually one to right a review on products, but i had to for this one! everyone needs this product. it is lightweight, does not leave a white cast, does not feel oily on the skin at all, and does not have the typical sunscreen scent! i apply this daily after my moisturizer and it does not break me out. i think anyone can use this product and please take my word for it, it is amazing! added bonus it is clean at sephora",positive
took a week or so to realize my skin was not happy with this stuff. natural fragrance was probably the irritant that made my face bumpy,negative
"weird. loved it so much when i got the sample version- it was much thicker then- and i made it last for so long. but when i bought this size, it takes double the amount to achieve the same level of moisture.",neutral
this is a nice eye cream for sure- i like that it solely moisturized and does not de-puff or firm. i find those formulations to actually be quite drying. this cream however feels great around the eyes and provides hydration with a light weight feel. works well under makeup as well. i got this through influenster!,neutral
"i love using aha and bhas on my skin and this one in particular is a miracle worker. my skin looks noticeably brighter and more smooth the morning after using this, and it is not too harsh that it burns or irritates my skin. if my skin needs extra moisture, i will just top with a rosehip or marula oil over top. such an amazing serum and i recommend this to anybody with all skin types and skin concerns. cannot say enough great things.",positive
"i broke out the day after adding this into my skincare routine, and it has taken a few days for my skin to clear up.",negative
"wanted to love it, it made my eyes look so beautiful. they were tightened and brightened. however they were swollen and itchy days later. somewhat irritated the first two days. i am not sure what ingredient it was that irritated them but i wish they would fix it. stars for the hydration and beautiful brightening.",neutral
"i do not know why but my skin broke out so bad with this product and the arbutin acid serum separately, in a way i have never seen before. i do not get acne on my cheeks but after applying these products, my entire face was covered in pimples. i tried waiting and alternating which product i was using. it honestly looked similar to something you would see in a movie. p i know this reaction is rare it is almost impossible to find similar results and this product is very excellent but i am really curious as to why my skin reacted so badly to this product. i would really love to know from the company, i think they should maybe place info describing what to do in this scenario. should i use the product every days or week in order to lessen my reaction? i use retinol, thd vitamin c higher ph, and hyaluronic acid at night. during the day i use ascorbic acid vitamin c and hyaluronic acid. i have heard that niacinamide and vitamin c can cause this type of reaction but cannot find info explaining this. also, apparently, when you first start using a product that involves cell turnover, your skin can break out. this is called purging. however, your skin should be breaking out where you are prone to acne. i am not sure if i should continue using this product, lesson my use every days or once a week, or if i should just discontinue use. i am going to put two stars just so this can be viewed easier by the company! this is still an awesome product though and works well for others! i do not necessarily have oily skin either so this is odd!",negative
i like the smell and the lather however it dried out my face badly. i used my usual moisturizer after the cleanse and my face still felt super dry. i had to apply my moisturizer twice and still was not enough.this cleanser is not for everyone. did not enjoy the cleanse and i am glad i bought a mini size.,negative
"i got this in a play! box and did not like it at all. it felt like it left a thin film over my face, and maybe it was supposed to do that, but my face just did not feel clean. i ended up rewashing with another cleanser.",negative
i have been on the hunt for a good face sunscreen and will not settle for anything less than spf. this one started off working quite well. i do not normally wear any makeup so no issues there. one the rare occasions i did cover up some red patches it did not want to layer under the makeup like a good sunscreen. think oil and water. not a good look. then i went to the beach. my face was the only place i used this sunscreen on. i woke up the next morning with a horrid rash of whiteheads in my t zone. i am thinking it did not play well with the ocean water and my pores got heavily clogged.,neutral
compared to other serums in this price range this did not work for me. very disappointed considering a lot of the reviews were so positive.while my face was hydrated it was only short term. within a few hours my face was dry. there is no brightening results for me.,neutral
"got this product as part of my birthday gift, and i love it. moisturizes well, skin looks a bit better and glowing. this has a very light scent and very rich. a little goes a long way!",positive
"i wanted to love this, but i just do not. i am darker skinned and i definitely look purple. i use chlyndamicin under so the smell of burnt toast when i go into the sun is prevalent.",neutral
"when i first heard i was going to be receiving a complimentary bottle of the tacha dewy serum from influenster, i was ecstatic. i have been using this serum for about one month now. the serum itself is very light and a little definitely goes a long way. it has a very faint scent that does not clash with any perfume. this serum is perfect for layering and is super easy to incorporate into your everyday skin care routine! the cold winters typically leave my skin feeling dry and looking dull, but this product has proved to be the perfect fix. i have found that my skin not only feels more hydrated, but the serum gives it that natural dewy glow. the serum absorbs into the skin very nicely and leaves behind no greasy residue. i am able to easily put makeup on over the product. i have not yet seen a difference in my fine lines, but i do know that those types of changes come with time and i am confident this product will deliver. i would definitely recommend!",positive
"overall i would give this produce a., if half stars were an option. i think this product has its place in a daily skincare routine but i would say it was not versatile enough for me. i enjoyed the packaging of this product, it felt like a high quality skincare item, the glass container was heavy and the packaging felt higher end. upon opening i noticed the moisturizing cream was a yellowoff white almost like banana pudding or vanilla ice cream. i smelled the product to make sure it was not spoiled, i typically associate face products to be more crisp white, which seems to convey a more pure product, however this smelled fine. i actually kind of liked the scent it was a bit floralsweet which was pleasant as some products smell medicinal or earthy. upon first application i noticed that this a a bit thicker than expected, the product description mentioned that it was a rich, lightweight product. i felt like it was a bit heavy for me to use twice a day, morning and evening. after a couple days of trying to allow this to be my stand alone moisturizer i opted to only use this in the evening as a bedtime moisturizer. it felt too heavy to wear as part of my day time routine. i may even reserve it for nights i am feeling my skin is more dry vs. normal. overall i think this would be great for someone who is prone to a more dry skin condition or someone who wants a more rich product for evening. it felt luxurious just a bit heavy for my all day needs.",neutral
"it gives a tingling feeling on skin, have been applying to reduce dark spots, no difference seen, but hoping to see soon.",negative
"i usually love all sunday riley products water cream, night oil and lactic acid treatment are to die for but this felt different--way too thick and does not dissolve into skin well. would not recommend",negative
i am on accutane right now so my skin is very very dry. i still wear makeup but i try not to use things that will strip my skin- lately i have been using this religiously. it is soon and easy to apply and it takes off every bit of make not matter how caked on it is! this stuff is great for full coverage hard to remove makeup but it will not leave you feeling stripped. i was nervous about using an oil based cleaner- but farmacy beauty has never done me wrong yet... i will definitely repurchase once mine is gone!!,positive
"i received a free trial of this product and have been using it for about two weeks, and personally i believed that this product gives a similar result to that of the average drugstore cleanser. plus, it broke my skin out and i was not a fan of the smell.",negative
"i wanted to like this so bad since i am such a huge fan of the grape water mist. i have been using the beauty elixir for a month now and the only difference i feelsee is that it tinglesstings then leaves me a bit more red after i use it on my skin care routine. i do not see the pore tightening effect or minimizing its appearance more than the other products i use in my skincare routine. i also see the common review of it smelling a public toilet, i have to say it does sort of remind of it sometimes.the ml will basically last you- months if use it day and night. so i bet the ml would not even last through a couple weeks.it also comes in a glass bottle which makes it difficult to travel with and the bottle cannot be opened to pour the liquid into a separate spray bottle for when i go on planes etc. forcing you to have to purchase the ml.i would give this a pass if you want something to upgrade your grape water mist. i will not be repurchasing this again. tldr it does not do anything, but sting you are face, you might find that is smells like public toilet water, comes in breakable glass bottle. not worth the price.",negative
"overall a great product. about a year ago, i started using it because my skin was very damaged from the cold and using the wrong products for my skin. great formula and the price is definitely a bonus.just a heads up only use- drops for your face, otherwise you might experience some peeling!",positive
"this product is just ok. its not a life changing moisturizer, and it if it was not for the price tag, i would maybe repurchase. a couple of things i noticed, it does not play well under my makeup, i have to wait for this to dry completely, and even then it does pell up a bit. i preferred to use this at night. its smooth and the ingredients are nice, so three stars for that.",neutral
"this was way too greasy, i tried it once and had to wipe it off. and return it",negative
"i received this product complimentary for testing and my honest review. firstly this product has beautiful packaging... absolutely stunning, feels very lux. the product amount though is small but a little does go a long way so it will last you a while. i use this product multiple times per week at least in the evenings but sometimes both morning and night. the cream is light but thick, no offensive smells, not irritating, but i did not really see a noticeable improvement in my skin near my eyes either. i feel a slight tightening when i put it on so i do like that. overall this is an ok product but price point is on the high end",neutral
i have used this twice now and love it. did not feel the tingling or burning some others have reported. my skin is so soft after rinsing and it lasts for several days. it even minimizes my deeper maturity lines.,positive
"i have been using this eye cream for a few days now and i am not sure what ingredient in it caused an irritation on my eyelids. now my eyelids are dry. that however does not mean that the product will not work well for others. on a positive note, it did help with my puffy under eye area. i applied this eye cream with my ring finger by gently patting it in. gifted by alpyn beauty.",neutral
"received this product in my allure beauty box and i absolutely loved it. it has a nice texture and was a thicker cream i usually go for gel based moisturizers but did not feel too heavy or greasy on the skin. like one of the best moisturizers i have ever used, had a bihhh ready to throw some racks hunny! i finished the trial and immediately went to my jcpenney sephora to purchase a regular sized bottle. mind you, this product was a complete splurge. anyways, when i got it home it was that odd yellow color everyone was complaining about. i figured it did not make a difference so i began using. but then it dawned on me.... i just paid over fifty bucks for a product that may be expired or tainted in some kind of way? i dmed sunday riley on instagram and their response was immediate. i do appreciate them getting back to me so quickly but their response was we have encountered this particular variation before..... we promise these variances do not compromise the integrity of the product.like i said, i appreciate their customer service. they even offered to send me another product if i was not comfortable with using what i purchased but i decided to return. however, how can you have so many variations of such an expense product? what causes the variation in the first place? if you have a product that is produced the same way with the same ingredients then there should not be a difference. i could understand if it does not make sense to me. i consider sr a high end brand for my budget so it was a little surprising for their qc to be sub-par.maybe if they provided an explanation for the difference in color i would have been ok with keeping it.",neutral
"i received the cream with the top part broken where the spatula goes not that picky about it though..packaging is nice, the cream its self is not that special. a little goes a long way, it def makes the skin look dewy but so far i have just been using it as a night cream. its also good for sensitive skin, at least for me.",neutral
"this is a nice mask. i do not feel that it does anything spectacular. kind of shrinks pores, a little, does not seem to do much for blemishes. has a nice cooking effect on and when you add water to remove it. the effect is not harsh, so it does not burn or anything and it removes easily compared to other clay masks. do it for the gram.",neutral
"this is the least hydrating moisturizer i have ever used, and i have combo-oily skin. my cheeks and under eye area feel tight after i use this, and almost like it leaves a powdery residue. i tried to salvage it by mixing in some facial oil, and nothing helps. i cannot imagine who would enjoy this moisturizer. stay away, especially if you have dry skin.",negative

this stuff is amazing. i am using it for weeks every other night. and my skin looks so clear. acne marks are fading and pores look smaller.,positive
"the texture of this eye cream is amazing. i only need to use a little to get the benefits in my opinion. are all my lines gone? no, but it does reduce them and every eye has lines. it also hydrates my under eye. honestly my only complaint is the price, its a bit higher than i normally feel comfortable paying.",positive
"i decided to try this out after watching lots of skincare videos by hyram, and reading all of the amazing reviews! i have normal to oilysensitive skin and unfortunately this product broke me out. i got a few cystic pimples in places that i do not usually get them, like on my cheeks! i am going to be switching back to the cerave renewing sa cleanser but i will be using this as a body wash so that it does not go to waste! d by the way the scent is very strong! i do not think it is a bad product since it seems to have worked well for others, so it is probably just me! maybe it will work for you but if you have similar skin to me, i would not recommend it!ono",neutral
"i was so excited to use this but it broke me out on my face pretty badly. i understand purging can happen but i have experienced purging before and this was not it. but if you have kp try this! i used it on my arms out of curiosity and it smoothed things out in one night. so far it is been a couple of days and it seems to be working really well. the smell is fine, a little strong but nothing too bad. i am giving it three stars because i feel like it was advertised as a face serum but it does not work well as a serum. besides breaking me out, it would not stop pilling. even with no product, it still pilled. i am glad that i found another use for it",neutral
i have tried several cleansing oils and this is my least favorite. it does not take off my mascara and leaves my lashes still tacky from it. for the price it should be preforming better than others i have tried. back to dhc i go.,negative
"i have dry skin from eczema, so i always prefer hydrating base products. this is a good, no-frills, product to use before going in with your foundation. it is moisturizing but does not have an overly dewy finish, so i feel like people with combo and oily skin can use it too. my foundation applies smoothly on top of this. deducted one star because i am not a fan of the fragrance, but that is just personal preference! i received this product as a free sample.",positive
"this product was gifted by summer fridays. i have normalcombo skin with some fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes as well as dullness, texture and enlarged pores. i love the packaging that this comes in. the bottle has a great weight to it and the pump is very smooth to use and dispenses just the right amount. the texture of the serum is creamy and lightweight and it smooths into the skin easily. it does not leave behind any residue and layers well with my other skincare products and under makeup. i especially loved how gentle the formula is. while my skin is used to retinol i do sometimes get a little sensitivity when trying new kinds but with this one i had no sensitivity and no redness. i feel like my skin is looking radiant and i have noticed my forehead lines are softening as well.",positive

"when you first put the cream on it has a wonderful scent and rubs into the skin really nicely. i have comboacne prone skin and have to use an oil fee moisturizer. but for my areas of skin that are combo not just oily i am left with dry flakes about- minutes after this soaks in. like my skin seriously has never look drier and not hydrated. so i always have to go over those areas with a better moisturizer. just keep it in mind, still a good product but has a very specific niche.",neutral
i really loved this cleanser. it was really gentle which is great for my skin type but also i could really feel it getting in deep to cleanse my skin and clear out my pores. the texture is nice and grainy to get that physical exfoliation. and the smell is not at all overpowering. i really like the packaging as well cute but sophisticated. all in all i would rate this a and would definitely recommend this to a friend!,positive
"i like this moisturizer. not too greasy, works under makeup and absorbs fast but it pills so so bad. i do not know why it does that but i will not be repurchasing for that reason",neutral
i do not think i notice a difference. it is also a bit grainy and causes my makeup to peel a bit,neutral

i got this cleanser for free through influenster and it is easily my favorite cleanser i have ever used. i use it in the shower and it soaps up very nicely and leaves my face feeling clean and super soft. love the packaging and how it is environmentally conscious too. would buy again!,positive
"i cannot figure this product out. it turns from green to beige which is fun and probably cancels out some redness in the process. but it does not have enough coverage at least, for me to wear on its own. and following it with a foundation feels heavy on my face. so to me it is like an extremely light-coverage bb cream?then, i am also puzzled that the instructions suggest applying it in the morning and at night? while light in coverage, it does have makeup pigment, so it is not something i would want to sleep in...this product perplexes me, therefore i cannot recommend it.",neutral

"it is fine. it took a while to get used to the smell, but it does not linger, which is good. does not tighten my pores, which is not a thing anyway, but the pha bha properties balance out my skin. a decent combo product because i am always looking to cut time out of my routine and reduce countertop clutter. but i sort of feel like all my money went to the packaging and not the product.",neutral
does the job but i saw more significant and quicker results with the inkey lists niacinamide serum,positive
perfect step right after you cleanse your face. preps the skin nicely for all your other products. smells delicious and a few shakes goes a long way! i put it all over my neck and chest too with shakes,positive
"i have heard such amazing reviews about this product but unfortunately it dose not work well on my face. i mean do not get me wrong, it dose get the job well done by removing all of my heavy makeup but i will have to point out that the only thing that it did not remove was my eyelash glue. i have only used it twice only ever since i got it. the times that i have used it after wearing heavy makeup, it made me break out with a zit the next morning.",negative
i received these product for free from influenster so that i can review my experience with them. i would give the facewash a out of because i am neutral about it. the smell is not bad but it dosnt smell nice. it dosnt dry out my skin but it also did not feel hydrated. the facewash did not do anything for my skin. at least nothing special that i would buy it over my other skincare products.,neutral
i would bath in this stuff if i could. i have super dry skin that often cracks during the winter months and this has helps me so much. the formula and texture of the lotion is very soothing. very happy i purchased,positive
"my old face wash routine was not cutting it anymore and i happened to get a sample of this. this is everything i could have wanted. this removes my makeup, smooths my skin, and hydrates all while cleaning effectively. there is no need to double-cleanse. i bought the full size because i cannot run out. personally, i do not like the smell very much, and it is strong, but it reminds me of a spa at least. i even found out my husband has been sneakily using this because he likes it that much too.",positive
"when i got this product, i was hesitant to use it at first because it is the first time to try this brand. however, when i tried the product, i got totally amused of how it made my skin moisturized and protected from the sun at the same time!!! total game changer!!!",positive
"based on the reviews, i talked myself into justifying the price and treating myself to this luxury product. i wanted to like this so much, but it has done nothing for me. i have been using this product for almost a year with various foundations, but have noticed no priming qualities and see no difference from other moisturizers. i find myself getting very oily when i use this and having to touch up constantly. the smell is also a downside, it smells like lemon scented cleaning wipes. hard pass.",negative
"smells lovely but broke me out. like painful under the skin red zits. i have used it a few times not realizing where the break outs were coming from. i do not usually have pimples. i use this then i use my clarisonic with aha facial cleanser. after nights using it just used it a rd night in a row, and it hit me, so i came here to review right away my skin is a mess all of a sudden. this is the second farmacy product that my skin reacts this way to honeymoon glow. wish i knew the ingredient that causes breakouts. is this product non-comedogenic? really wish this worked for me as i love love love farmacys all in one salve.",negative
"this did end up breaking me out but i loved how my skin never felt dried out after using this! although this did not work for me, it is definitely cheap enough to give it a try!",neutral
"i wanted to love this creme but unfortunately i have acne prone skin and it makes my forehead so oily and i breakout. been using it for about a month with the serum, as i bought the set. the serum is amazing! my skin looks clearer overall. but the creme is too heavy for my oily skin. glad i got the kit and was able to try both for a pretty good deal. going to continue to use the serum and see if my mom wants to buy the creme off me lol...",neutral
"i like this cleanser. after starting using this product, i have gotten multiple compliments on my skin.",positive
i had a difficult time mixing this. then i could not get past the smell of this product. i attempted to use it quite a few times and each time the smell was so terrible. there has to be a way to change the odor.,negative
this reminds me of becca primers. you get that glow but it is much more hydrating than becca. i really like this primer and i have a ton of primers. i like this when i use a more matte foundation,positive
"i did not really see a difference in my skin after using this, but it felt nice and worked like any other toner. i would not buy it again because it did nothing for the appearance of my pores and was a bit pricey to not do what it says it does. i really did not care for the scent at all, to me it smells like chopped up green bell peppers.",neutral
"the smell is really refreshing, similar to an elevated cucumber scent. however, i find it not moisturizing enough for my dry spots on the cheek.",neutral
made me breakout way too occlusive and comedogenic for my skin. i ended up using it as a hand cream and liked it much better for this,negative
"i received this product for my honest review.i tried this eye cream for weeks every day and night. i did not see a change under my eyes at all, they still look dark and tired. i will keep trying it to see of maybe it just takes longer for mei can say it does moisturize my skin very well, you do not need a lot to go a long way i just dab i finger for a thin layer. i do not notice any smell either. i would not recommend to get rid of tired looking eyes, but just for moisturizing under the eyes yes.",negative
i applied this cream before bed and wake up oily and shiny... i tried wearing it to work and by the end of the day i am shiny again. disappointed,negative
"amazing feeling on the skin, and a soft smell. defenitly a must have.",positive
"too thick. i break out a lot when i use it near my temples, chin and sometimes my cheeks. i ended up looking like a romulan from star trek lol! my temples had so many clogged pores and bumps. i had to wait for them to turn to black heads to express them out.",negative
"i think this product would be great for someone who is skin is not as sensitive as mine. i did a skin test and could not use it on my face based on the results but, it worked great for my nephew. his skin looked amazing after he used it.",negative
"i received this product in this years sephora favorites skincares next big thing kit. this is an excellent primer. it is a chemical sunscreen, so there is no white residue or dulling of the skin. it is mattifying and a little drying, so it may be uncomfortable if your skin is already dry.",positive
"so far so good. i like to double-up this with the paulas choice bha product. i feel that this empowers the effectiveness of the salicylic acid. i have not had any issues with it thus far. i do not use it as often as i used to. only on the days i am exfoliating. i was using it daily, but i think my skin was not accepting it, and it did more harm than good. honestly, a lot of the other skincare products i use have niacinamide in it already, so i only use this as a booster when i need to.the dropper and bottle are wonderful, high quality. i find this to be beginner friendly for those new to skincare, and it also does not break the bank. i see a visible improvement in my skin since using it, and i really like the ordinary overall as a brand. this product is a must have, and i will continue to buy it when i run out. i bought this a while ago, and i am still using my first bottle as we speak. it lasts a long time when used right!",positive
"for me, this feels pretty thick for a sunscreenmoisturizer. it also smells heavily like an spf to me, although i have seen some reviews that say they did not notice any smell- so it must be personal. i do not feel like it did much for my face in general. also, i feel the packaging is gaudy. i know it is very jlo, but it is definitely not for me.",neutral
"i wanted to like this, as it is very convenient, but as others have said, it does not seem to work well for oily skin. it is visibly shiny after application, and just sits on my skin and makes me greasier throughout the day. might work better for drier skin types.",negative
"i really wanted to like this product because the smell and consistency and the ingredients were really nice. however after two weeks of using this face wash morning and night i developed little bumps all over my face, some were small pimples and some were itchy bumps. i have read some reviews that other people have also experienced bumps so there must be something in the formula that does not work. i will be switching back to my old face wash",negative
i use this to help clear my strawberry legs and it is working wonders. i know my legs may never be completely clear but this product helps a lot!,positive
"this is a really good eye cream for teens and people in their early-mid twenties with little issues on wrinkles or hydration. a luxurious beginner eye cream. i give it the star rating i gave because for someone that is and with pronounced eye wrinkles, this eye cream felt amazing at first but then it dried out my eyes after a few hours. i highly recommend this eye cream for younger people for that nice lift but not people who have dry eye skin or looking for anti-aging results.",neutral
"i guess for removing makeup this works well. however, if your skin is sensitive or if it has any dry patches in my case from retinol this dried out my face and left a burning feeling. so i would recommend to use if there were not current issues with your skin.",neutral
"this is a real review- i just purchased this serum last week, after seeing how highly it was rated although, i will admit, i did not look deep enough to see that this was a brand new product so all of those reviews definitely seem shady- and here are my thoughts so far... the consistency is basically like water so it is very runny. so much that the only effective way to apply it is by putting the dropper right on your face instead of in your hands, and then basically patting it in to your skin. the other thing i want to touch on is that the product smells like rubberbacon which i have read is pretty typical for a good vitamin c serum unfortunately. while the smell is awful, it does not last very long so that is a plus. in terms of results, i have not been using it long enough to notice any changes yet, but plan to edit my review once i have had enough time. i have seen a lot of people concerned over the fake reviews out there, so i wanted to add mine as soon as possible to give you an initial idea of the product.",neutral
burned my skin. i have used ahabha things before and i would take the glow recipe one that does nothing for me a thousand times over this one,negative
"i have mixed feelings on dermalogica, yet leaning more to the positive. it arrived in a nice box with a pretty impressive description and easy to use tube. my personal issue is dark circles under the eyes with fine lines starting to appear in the eye area. dermalogica with its supercharged vitamin c eye serum sounded perfect. to be honest, i have used it for just a few weeks and feel it warrants to more weeks for proper due diligence, but for now here are my findings. it has been a few weeks and i am not seeing a difference with my fine lines as of yet, but there is a slight lightening under my eyes. the serum is much thinner than i expected, is super lightweight and takes a minute to dry, so make sure to use a tiny drop at a time. i guess i was expecting something a bit more substantial. this feels almost like it has too much water or it is a tad too thin. it does help to shake before use. there is no scent, so that is a positive. one more thing is the cost may seem expensive, but that small tube is going to last you quite some time. i will follow up in a few weeks with some more results.",neutral
this product did absolutely nothing. not worth the price.,negative
"i am sure it works great because the ingredients are good, but i cannot get past the smell. it is super fishy smelling, so much so that i cannot put it on without holding my breath until it dries. for reference, i usually go towards products that have little to no fragrance. in this case, it is not fragrance that is irritating at all, it just stinks.",negative
"i really liked this at first, except for the consistency. it is really thick. it seemed to clean my skin until a couple weeks later. now it dries out my skin, but somehow i also have acne.",negative
it is okay. it did not do anything magical. i think it is over hyped. it helps with redness but also dries you out like crazy at the same time.,neutral
my daughter bought me the tatcha gift set with this cleanser and the water cream. i have combo-oily skin. the cleanser left small burns on my skin. yikes!,negative
love this product! the smell is refreshing but not overwhelming and the texture is perfect! will be buying again and again!,positive
"i keep rebuying! i haw used this for months now and do not foresee myself stopping. it is a great nighttime serum. i have sensitive and dry skin and i have no issues. i wake up with brighter skin. there is a significant difference of for some reason i forget to use it the night before. i have acne prone skin apps, and this clears everything right up.",positive
this mask leaves my skin softer and brighter! i like the honey scent and shimmery goldgrey colour. it is easy to remove and does not leave black charcoal all over the skin like other charcoal masks i have tried before.,positive
"i generally love skin fix products, but this one was just average. my skin typically responds very well to bhas, but with this spot treatment, i noticed no observable difference overnight or over a few days. it might have minimized the growth of acne, but did not shrink it. i am going to keep using this and see if it helps more over long periods of time.",neutral
i love using kiehls ultra cream. it is very light on the skin. it absorbs very quickly without leaving any oily residue. it has no scent into it. i have extremely dry skin all year long. so i have to moisturize my face even in the summer. the kiehls ultra cream is just perfect for my dry and sensitive skin. i would definitely recommend it. i received this from bzzagent to try and give my honest opinion,positive
i am only giving this three stars because it makes my skin feel super greasy to the point that it is actually hard to sleep with it on. comes in a small jar but is lasting a long time. i wanted to see some results for the price. i will use it but will not purchase again.,neutral
feeling very greasy on my face. and you might not want to use it with other serum because it is pilling if i mix them.,neutral
"i have never used a toner before this, but i have a lot of redness around my nose, uneven skin tone and patches of dry and oily skin. large pores and sensitive skin, you name it. i was not expecting miracles but all i received was slight softness afterwards. not for me, i do not get what all the hype is with toners.",negative
love this night moisturizer amazing hydration rich feels more like a treatment especially during dry winters,positive
"decided to try this as a final shot with yttp line of products. after a few days of continuous use morning and night, it plumps the skin but not much else. definitely need to follow up with moisturizer after application. good experience so far, but i will not purchase again.",neutral
received a sample of this when i bought a few other products and i wanted to love it but it broke me out i had pimples all over my neck and i do not ever hardly break out,negative
"this eye cream is heinous. literally the worst product i have ever tried. it has glitter in it, like literally sparkles- what? it has perfume. it overall not for me. i will be retuning it.",negative
"started using this a few months and had no issues or breakouts. i was using it in conjunction with the toner, buffet, and moisturizer and my skin looked amazing but not sure what impact this had because like i said, i was using it with other products. i stopped using it for a few months and started using it again a couple weeks ago and my skin has broken out horribly around my mouth, chin and jaw. painful pimples and my skin looks like a disaster. gave it a couple weeks in case my skin was purging but it just continues to get worse so i am throwing the rest out.",negative
"was really excited to try this after all the good reviews, but it did nothing for my skin. i did not notice more hydration or any improvements with my skin. nothing bad happened but nothing happened at all. i do not expect miracles from products, but i do like to see subtle changes when i spend money on things so i am returning.",negative
"this moisturizer is just ok in my opinion. the packaging is so cute and it smells delicious, but other than that, it performed just as well as some of my drugstore gel moisturizers. my skin felt moisturized and hydrated. the product does what it says, but you can get the same effect from a cheaper moisturizer.",positive
"i received this in exchange for a review. i love this brand as a whole, they have some amazing products and this cream is one of them. i love the consistency of it, not too think or too thin. this absorbs really well. i cannot wait to see continued results!",positive
"these are my new go-to. i can use these on any kind of acne and i always see noticeable improvement overnight. sometimes, it just completely clears up a spot- poof, gone the next morning. for deeper, cystic acne, it either accelerates the process so i get it cleared up faster, or just completely zaps it before it can come to a head. two things i like about these spot treatments compared to others i have also used the starface stickers is that they are substantial enough to actually keep me from picking at my skin and that they stick to my skin. they do not fall off if i brush my teeth or roll over in my sleep. if i have got a really stubborn spot then i will keep a dot on it through the day, too. i work from home and the clear spots are basically invisible on a zoom call, so i can wear them during the day without any self-consciousness. this is a little gross, but i also really like that you can see from the dot whether a spot has come to a head or not- it helps me decide next steps for caring for my skin.",positive
i have lighter skin and the underneath of my eyes are not much darker than the rest of my skin. i do have puffiness in my eye area in the mornings and it did help with that. lightweight formula and a little bit of product goes a long way,negative
"i received this as a complimentary sample i love this dewy serum. its light, soft, yet adds full coverage. it gives me a soft dewy glow under my foundation. i would buy this!!",positive
"was too harsh. dried skin out bad. like another user said, caused cystic pimples immediately. had to return. love the reishi moisturizer however and other yttp products.",negative
"you can tell a difference after just one use. i woke up with a smooth, plump face. the thing i love most about this product is after using it for a few weeks, i noticed my redness had drastically gone down!",positive
for me this pilled terribly and did not do anything,negative
"did not do anything for me. i think that you would have to have very fair skin, like snow white pale, for this to show any kind of difference. do not bother buying if you have light or light medium skin tone.",negative
"firstly, i received this product for free to test out. after using this product in the morning and evening for weeks, i did not notice a difference in my skin--no improvement with fine lines around my mouth or eyes, no decrease in dark circles, and no significant skin radiance. the positives about this product are that the unique packaging of a serum in a stick makes application mess-free and easier. i do notice a lot of hydration when i put it on but i prefer a serum that adds radiance and hydration. i prefer my tatcha vitamin c serum over this product.",neutral
could not love this product more! leaves my face feeling so hydrated and plush in the morning. strong scent but i enjoy it. really is a bed side table staple. cannot wait to try this while flying as my skin tends to dry out on planes. i did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.,positive
"i was sadly the epitome of dark spots but after using this, i should be their spokesperson for their dark spot toner miracle team! get your confidence back with this toner. results are quick and spots will fade! none of that glow that just masks your spots, this will even out your skin tone so you can restart with a clean canvas.",positive
i did not love it. i did not hate it. so it comes down to would i be willing to pay the price. the answer is no. did it feel hydrating? i guess. did it make me glow? no. did it smell great? undecided. ultimately i was not blown away in an over saturated skin care market i do not think this delivered the goods.,neutral
"love all of my ptr products but this product left my oily skin too greasy throughout the day. i just cannot do it. on the flip side, the spf does just what it is supposed to.",neutral
"alright, probably my least favorite of the ordinary products i have tried. i do not feel that this does much more than the eye cream i use.. most likely will not buy again",neutral
i found this product to work really well but it made my skin super dry. i decided to get a facial oil fresh-seaberry to help and it did!!! made using this product x better and i am seeing results faster.,positive
"if you have a normal to dry skin type i do not think this will be enough for you. i got this because james welsh recommended but i should have known not to because his skin type is oily. if you like dewy plump skin i do not not think this will do it for you, to the touch my skin does not feel horrible like cracked and dry but it does not feel moisturized and silky like how i want a moisturizer to make my skin feel. when i wake up in the morning my skin feels stiff and taught to move. for some people i am sure it is great but i will not be repurchasing",neutral
"this changed my skin!!! been using since. i had horrible breakouts and acne. went to sephora and was given a sample of this. literally overnight, after one use, my skin drastically changed. i still have acne issues, but the texture of my skin is no longer peanut brittle thanks to this product. i use one pump every night and it last all year long. i buy it in december with the christmas value box lol. tlc for life!!!",positive
omg this is a miracle cream it really helps with redness and acne scaring and it moisturizes really well. i have very sensitive skin i can use this with no issue.,positive
"nice and creamy, well absorbed, keep make up in place, very hydrating. it does not irritate my eyes.",positive
"wow this serum does the trick! i was intrigued by the caffeine, niacinamide, and cannabis hyaluronic acid so i was excited to start using it and i was so impressed by how much it brightened up my skin, plumped it, and made me seem more awake. also the smell is heavenly and it is very sheer and sinks in quickly, meaning i could put moisturizer on immediately afterwards. i will buy when i finish this free product for testing purposes.",positive
"i used to have the occasional breakout, but ever since i started using this mask, i have not had one breakout. i have been using this mask for about three months, and my skin is in the best condition it has ever been in! it is glowy and soft and i have very minimal texture, this mask did everything it promised to do. i recommend this product to everyone in my life, so now i am recommending it to you! add to basket",positive
the smell of this is really nauseating like a lot of people mentioned here. i very rarely if not ever get thrown off only because of scents but this is something else. i put the mask a few hours before bed and rinsed it off and used other products on top of it and its still very there. i want to vomit and i cannot sleep. i will give this a week to prove it does anything that is worth the smell. i will add another review if it gets better.,negative
"this was the formulation change all self tanners needed. if you shake it properly, spray evenly, and use a glove to perfect it you will have the best faux tan of your life. the added oils make it so much more moisturizing and i do not get any of the weird dry patches where it clings too much. the light provides a lot of color so do not automatically assume you need the medium or dark if you are light or fair skinned.",positive
"i have been loving this as a morning rinse. i wake up, apply this on with a cotton pad and continue with my routine. i stopped cleansing my skin in the morning a long time ago because i felt like my skin felt amazing in the morning and had been following up with a hydratibg or exfoliating toner before applying my creams, and i think this is a great product to use for this purpose instead of a toner. love that it protects the skin from free radicals",positive
"i love everything about this product except for the fact that i breakout every time i wear it. i love the texture and consistency. it is like a makeup primer for your face. i love the way it makes my skin feel. but every time i wear it, i break out on my forehead cheeks.",neutral
product is ok but the packaging kept making the product explode- passed the return date so i ended up throwing it out.,negative
"i think this product contains too much silicone dimethicone. it goes on very slippery so it momentarily feels moisturizing, but that is just the silicone. it does not keep the skin moisturized, and i have not seen any major improvements. stars because it goes well underneath dry sunscreens and does not give me any breakouts.",neutral
"there are many serums out there for helping to reduce wrinkles etc. however, i have been using this new formula going on days and i see a difference in the wrinkles starting to form to the left and right of my smile! everyone always wants to see results, sometimes faster sometimes slower, but i would say this serum knocks it out of the park for me in seeing some change that quick. i have combo skin and this did not leave my skin oily nor dry. it absorbed in well and hydrated my skin. i also have sensitive skin and sometimes products leave my face a little red and i had no reaction either. i have been putting this serum on in the am and pm each day followed by a great moisturizer. it definitely is repairing, resurfacing and replumping my skin! great price too. high recommend!!",positive
"very disappointed with this product. it was recommended to me when i walked in sephora. while she did a wonderful matching the color perfectly, the product itself is terrible. it adds texture all over my skin and appears blotchy. it accentuates my acne scars on my cheeks and my oil starts appearing within two hours of wear. i have tried applying with fingers, brush, dry sponge, and wet sponge but no luck. i would not recommend.",negative
"i am a little surprised to see so many five star reviews for this! i have normal, often dry skin and this makes my face feel and look incredibly oily. i have been using it off and on for about months, but in the past couple of weeks have been using it every night just to use it up. definitely would not recommend for under makeup, i have not tried it with makeup due to its oiliness but can imagine it would make my face extremely shiny throughout the day. after applying this at night, i wake up looking oily, as if it has not absorbed and i am always happy to wash it off first thing in the morning. while there are products out there that are worse, there are many that are far better. i am glad that i did not break out from this, like many other reviews have said. would not repurchase though and do not recommend.",negative
i decided to try this as a pt reward. i regretted it instantly! this greasy balm smeared my mascara all over without actually removing it. i had to use a separate makeup remover to remove my makeup once i got this greasy stuff off my face. it literally feels like you are spreading bacon fat all over your face and then scraping it and your makeup residue off with water. what a waste!,negative
i am really happy with the results of muraddr. zions retinol youth renewal eye mask!!! this mask feels soothing and cooling when applied and my undereye area looks less puffy when i remove the masks. i also do see blurring of my fine lines!,positive
"i did not notice any significant difference. however, once i kept using it, my skin started to sting, which was super disappointing. i bought it because the ingredient list seemed quite tame, but unfortunately it hurt to put on. if your moisture barrier is compromised, this will not help you. eventually, i ended up using the rest of the bottle on my body...and my body skin showedfelt no difference either.- star for being nothing out of the ordinary- star for being extremely expensive i would have been okay paying-, but is pushing it- star for stinging my skin",negative
"first of all i would like to say that i have never looked so young after using this. once applied it looks like i have pores and my face is completely matte. i did see bad reviews on this product peeling, but if you continue to rub it in it lays on the skin perfectly. i have to rub for about seconds for the peeling to stop. trust me it looks amazing after you actually rub it in! i will never try another primer again!",positive
"way too thick for my normal to dry skin, even in the winter. i just look like an oil slick.",neutral
"just okay. i felt a burning sensation on my skin and i normally have hardy skin, it is able to take a lot and i am normally not sensitive at all. for the price per ml, i have used better toners at much better costs. my skin did feel smooth and supple the next morning, but the application turned me off. i received this product for free for my honest review.",negative
"i wanted to love this eye cream because i love all fab products, but this left my eyes extremely dry, especially in the corners, it would be crusty and itchy, no madam. if you have sensitive and dry under eyes this is not for you. no matter how much i applied it would get dry.",negative
"alpyn beauty gifted me with a sample of this product in exchange for a sample review. it is a re-surfacing and exfoliating product that works two ways. one of those is physical exfoliation with blueberry seeds. he other is not. there are eight naturally-sourced acids in this product four of those aresalicylic, citric, magic, tartaric, glycol. the others are listed in my full review. it is pink, and the directions recommend you use it on freshly cleansed skin, leaving it on for about five minutes before rinsing. there is not a strong scent to this product,but it is light and reminiscentof something nice. i had a veryinteresting experience using this sample because",neutral
"i have been using this as my first cleanse consistently for months and my final verdict is that it does an okay job at removing makeup, but it leaves an uncomfortable, slippy residue when i try to rinse it off. normally that would not bother me because i am on a budget and i will usually like something as long as it does its job, but i will not repurchase this because i feel like there has to be a better makeup remover balm on the market. bottom line skip this one.",neutral
love this! i have oilydehydrated skin with surface redness and this has done wonders for keeping me hydrated and toning down the redness in my cheeks. i have not experienced any breakouts either which is a plus! will definitely repurchase.,positive
"it is only been weeks and my skin has lightened, brightened, more even-toned, and my mother even noticed! this works. i barely ever wear foundation now which is my end goal. i really believe in these products and i feel super blessed to have find products that actually work and affordable. i will no longer be buying high-end products when i can buy multiple products from the inkey list and feel satisfied with the results! thank you sooooo much!",positive
i did not love this. it did not do much for my mature s combo skin.,neutral
i really wanted to like this product but it caused my skin to breakout and did not feel like it was hydrating my skin at all.,negative
"i would have loved to try this but i could not get past the fragrance. it is so unbelievably fragranced and the smell lingers for a long time. i have sensitive skin and fragrance irritates it and it just is not necessary in luxury skincare products. i could not even use this long enough to see results. sad, because i was looking forward to trying this.",negative
"this is the real deal. i have been concerned about how much my crows feet and s were starting to show and after using this for about four days, they literally started to soften and smooth. i am also applying a little around my lips and outer forehead. this stuff is legit. i will be a repeat buyer.",positive
the ingredients of this one are fantastic! love hyaluronic acid in skincare and the amino acids and pineapple enzyme leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated. it absorbs quickly and dries cleanly without any sticky residue. i love their jet lag mask and am now a fan of this one!,positive
"i have had a couple of deluxe sample sizes of this and have used it quite a few times now. i do find it to be somewhat hydrating. and i like using it after using the ordinary peeling solution. it is quite calming and soothing. however, it is not amazing enough of a product for me to want to purchase a full size.",neutral
"i received this product for free to review on influenster. this product does not smell very strong, although it has a light sunblock-like scent to me. it is a light, liquid substance that you apply during your daily facial cleansing routine. over time, i did not notice a very big difference when adding this item into my routine, however, there was a small change that made my skin look slightly more dewy. i do not have facial wrinkles or uneven skin tone, so i cannot comment on that. overall, i do like and recommend this product, but those who live in humid environments should take caution, as it can feel a little sticky on your face during that kind of weather.",neutral
"i wanted to love this product because i have heard so many good things about this brand. i have oilycombo skin and i will say that initially, it did leave a nice glow on my face and was moisturizing. however, the next morning i woke up with a huge breakout all over my cheeks and my nose peeling from apparent sunburn, even though i applied the recommended amount. i have had breakouts before but never on my cheeks before and never that badly. it left my cheeks dry and bumpy. i will not be using this anymore.",negative
this serum smells like a can of farts but i love the way it makes my skin feel. minus one point for the aroma otherwise it is amazing.,positive
did not really get rid of my dark spots but it brightens the skin a little,neutral
"dior improved formula of this product and now it has some good anti-aging ingredients. the new formula also seems to have less alcohol which is great for my dry skin. the packaging is very luxurious and the product does a good job prepping my skin for makeup. however, this product has one major drawback which they did not fix with the new formula and it is the fragrance! it has a very strong smell of parfume and it just ruined this primer for me, because my skin got irritated. it is alsi worth mentioning that my skin is not sensitive abd it rarely gets irritated. i was happy to get this product for free from influenster, but i would not repurchase it.i would not recommend this product for people wirh dry or sensitive skin. i hope dior will further improve their formula and will reduce the amount of fragrance.",neutral
"i wanted to love this product. it smells and feels fantastic, applies smoothly, and washes off cleanly. but after using this followed by a gel cleanser, a toner-soaked cotton pad still picks up dirt and makeup from my face. i simply cannot use a face cleanser that does not clean my face.",negative
"i was disappointed that there was a n air void in the container, which probably accounted for of the product. otherwise, i love this eye cream!",negative
does what it says but the smell is horrid. why does it smell like straight chemicals??? i have no other way to describe the smell. just chemicals. had to knock off stars for that,neutral
"i received this for free from influenster in exchange for my opinion. i actually really like this. the metal applicator is cool to touch on the skin, flip it over to the ball surface to massage product in. it is a very soothing massage. as far as the product goes i enjoyed that as well, cooling effect, did not irritate my sensitive eyes, and also depuffs!",positive
"i love this serum, such incredible quality and wonderful texture. my skin feels firmer and more hydrated over time. this is my go-to serum product. definitely pick yourself up this anti-aging care activating serum. this was gifted by sulwhasoo.",positive
"l bought this product because my skin can get extremely dry and crack in the winter but this just feels heavy and seems to be causing bumps on my skin, it does feel hydrating when you put it on but it can get greasy. i really wanted to love it but it just does not work for my skin.",neutral
rich and hydrating but does not tighten. used generous amount every day and night. smoothes crinkling but no tightening effects,negative
"used as prescribed, left on overnight. i was surprised at how thick it felt. i put it on about an hour before bed, thinking that it would at some point absorb into the skin. when i woke up the next morning my face was still sticky with the mask. very uncomfortable and way too thick for me. since then, been using it as a-mins mask, and wash off instead of keeping on overnight. the effect is okay but i probably will not buy again.",neutral
"firstly, the packaging was enough to swoon over. but i cannot say enough good things about the effectiveness of this cream! the texture, the light scent, the absorbency, the glow! on top of all, it calms my cheeks when they are flushed from mild rosacea. i have been using it for about a month and i can tell a difference in the tone and texture of my skin, as well as overall softness. such a beautiful and well-balanced night cream! keeping it as my secret weapon for glowy, soft skin! love this addition to my nightly ritual and will definitely be buying again, although i think this pot will last me quite a bit longer.",positive
"glass bottle is beautiful color and feels heavy, luxurious. plastic pump, however, is a pain in the neck to get to swivel correctly to allow the pump to pop up for product dispensing. i had to literally bitetug it since trying both hands was useless without unscrewing the cap altogether. product feels nice and light, pump releases very little. felt- pumps actually made it enough for full face so that is a lot and you would go through this quickly. does not remove makeup despite claims. or more mascara and liner left behind and face felt like i needed a double cleanse for makeup so for, it should be made to either legitimately to both or say use an oil before or after to remove makeup allow this to just be the regular staple cleanser. the ingredients are pretty solid but not high enough in concentration to be of benefit when mixed with water andor rinsed off. if you apply to dry skin to cleansemassage then add water to massagelargerrinse i feel that works better. pumping into hands then adding water to lather in hands to apply to skin is a no go. try both ways and see which works for you. i have very dry skin so for me, this was drying than i would have anticipated or ever wanted. i did not change anything in my regimen but add this in- after days, i had dry flakes persistently on my nose. an oilier or combination skin might really love this for the light gel texture, larger and slight purifying factor. with my years experience in cosmeticsskincare, this should not be marketed to all skins.",neutral
"i received a small sample of this product that was enough for about five days worth of use. i woke up on the fifth morning, with one more use left for that night, and seeing little to no difference after using it so many days in a row. i was so glad i had not purchased the full size with it being so expensive.but then- but then i woke up on that sixth morning having used that last little bit the night before and thought, girl. did i repost fifty different emoji-spell-for-glowing-skin posts in my sleep or something? this serum is a straight-up dupe for highlighting palettes. you really do need to use this for a minute before you can see a difference, but its worth the wait. the only reason i did not give it five stars was because the product is advertised as a glow-giver, but also a hyperpigmentation helper, which it did not seem to deliver on. i cannot say i used it long enough to determine whether it helped my acne but it definitely did not break me out. but at the end of the day i would definitely repurchase.",positive
i have been using this product for a few weeks now and unfortunately i have not seen many results. i have a few dark spots on my face that i absolutely hate and i am very self-conscious about them especially with only being years old. i use this product as directed well unfortunately i do not see them fading. i do like the way the product feels on the skin and a little goes a long way. i was super excited to try this for free and i am really happy i did not spend the on it with no results thus far. i will continue to use and see if i have any results.,negative
this is so hydrating it stays on. its a thick consistency for those who do not like heavy eye creams beware but i love the feeling i use it for my night routine everyday.,positive
"this product is complimentary gifted by kora organics in exchange of my honest review. i have tried this a few times and oh man, i expected it to smell like berries or something. but if not that, i did not expect it to smell like old rubber. it is too too bad. texture is very thick and rich. kept me hydrated but it felt like too heavy. i would not recommend it.",negative
"really good for dry, sensitive skin. i had a dry patch and in about three days, my dry patch was gone.",positive

"smells great, has nice lather when applied to skin but leaves skin dry once i pat dry. i have normal combination skin and normally do not feel to dried out when cleansing but this cleanser does leave me feeling like i need to apply moisturizer as soon as possible. i love all summer fridays products but this one did not do it for me. tip apply this cleanser with your hands rather than a face wash tool you get better lather.",neutral
"the smell is lovely and texture is nice but not for my skin. it felt too heavy and thick for my large poreacne proneoily combo skin. i am now using the belif sleeping mask and that is absolutely perfect. i am not saying that this is a bad product, it is just did not work the best for me.",neutral
"i bought this and the ordinarys caffeine solution. i used each item on only one eye for a couple of weeks, and was planning to go for longer, but i think that inkey has won the battle. both products are nice, but one eye looks slightly less puffy and dark as a result so contest is over as far as i am concerned. texture feels nice going on and does not leave a sticky finish which is another advantage over the ordinary. i cannot vouch for how well makeup goes over it, but so far i am very happy with it.",positive

"generally an ok cleanser. it is too thick for my liking as i feel like it is challenging to rinse off, however, with that you get a lot of use out of one tube. does little to remove makeup. is generally ok, nothing special, will be going back to other cheaper cleansers that work better. wanted to love it but just do not.",neutral

the product feels nice and rich but it does not penetrate- sits on top of the skin and so my face is dry by the time i get off work. i also have not noticed any tightening effect after weeks or so.,negative
"use sparingly, can severely over dry skin. i normally have very oily skin. after using this product for weeks, my skin became extremely dry and even began to flake off and itch. i stopped using it and now weeks later my skin feels pretty good, not too dry and not oily.",neutral
this product works wonders! i have been trying to stop using makeup wipes but could not find a product that was so great for your skin and taking off makeup. this product did all these things and more! definitely buying again!,positive
this just did not work for me at all. it has a less than pleasant yeasty smell which i could have tolerated but it did not absorb into my skin at all so much so that i had to rinse it off because i could not stand the feel of it just sitting there. luckily i got this as a sample from the biossance website and did not have to return anything. instead i found the biossance gel moisturizer to be divine.,negative
moisturizes and makes your face glowy but not sure i would repurchase,neutral
"i want to love this like i love so many other farmacy products but i just do not. i do not love the smell. i do not think it is all that hydrating. my dropper never seems to drop anything off on my face. for the price, i expect more. i will stick to my tried and true herbivore emerald oil.",neutral
"i am so in love. this is everything a cleanser should be. it is gentle, smells amazing, and i feel as though my skin is thoroughly cleaned as well as moisturized. it leaves my skin so unbelievably soft. amazing for combination skin and sensitive skin! i would recommend this cleanser a million times over. thank you, tatcha, for saving my skin!",positive
"it gets my makeup off and is a good size for price, but it is not great. it smells nice! very light scent. it is super runny and gets everywhere, it drips down the pump and onto the bottle. it made me break out and my eyes burn, sadly. i really wanted to love this.",neutral
"melts nicely, but makes my eyes watering crazy and my vision gets blurry.",negative
"what a seriously incredible serum. i was skeptical as i have tried so many pricey serums with little to no results but this one? this one you could tell a difference immediately!! my skin felt so much softer, more hydrated, and supple. it looked more radiant and luminous then it had in years!! i am by the way worth the price, you will will not be disappointed!!! i recieved this from influnster free in exchange for my honest review. and this review is honest, if i did not like it i would tell yall. they do not penalize you for bad reviews so if this was not the new holy grail i believe it to be id have no issue saying so.",positive
"first off, this is a first cleanse! you need an oil based cleanser to draw out sebum and break down spf and makeup, and then second cleanse is a water based cleanser to remove dirt and sweat. science! i have been using this cleansing balm for a little over a week now but i have actually seen a major difference in my skin in that time. i just added retinol to my skincare and suddenly my skin could not handle the ahas and vitamin c i had been using at the strength i would been using them. so i am working on repairing my skin barrier right now and trying to find the right balance in my acids and actives. i am nearly, and my skin is very sensitive, combination leaning dry, still breakout prone! this cleansing balm comes in a tube genius, love the packaging, with a thick almost ointment consistency. i warm it up between my fingers a little before applying it to the dry skin on my face. i give my face a good, light massage, and i rub it over my eyes and brows. it does not irritate my eyes or leave a film or give me blurred vision, and it breaks down all my makeup and sunscreen. i use a wet muslin cloth to gently remove most of the balm, and then i rinse with water to emulsify any leftover balm and remove it. my second cleanse youth to the people superfood cleanser removes any remaining debris from my pores. this combination has been fantastic, and my pores are actually looking much more refined, much less irritated, fewer breakouts! i think it is because of the inkey list balm, and why i think that is because the oils used in this balm are fairly high in linoleic acid omega-. acne patients have been shown in some studies to have low levels of linoleic acid in their skin, which can lead to very sticky sebum and skin cell buildup. adding linoleic acid appears to help unstick that buildup and clear the pores. and i think that is what i am experiencing with this balm! there is a slight graininess to the texture from the oat kernels, and so i would be mindful and gentle massaging.",positive
"overall, i enjoyed this sunscreen. i never got burned using it and it did not feel too greasy. however, i sometimes felt a little itchy after using, but not entirely sure that was from the sunscreen. my biggest complaint was that there was so little of it- i only used it a handful of times and was out almost immediately",neutral
i can always count on this product as my daily moisturizer and i love the price point!!,positive
"i used a sample of this three nights ago, about an hour post application my skin felt sunburned. it was a bit tight, but soft and moisturized...lying on a pillow was uncomfortable. the next morning my regular cleanser and moisturizer tingled uncomfortably. it abated, and i thought at least i did not break out!, i spoke too soon. now i have got several new spots. threw away my sample, it is not for me.",negative

"the first week and a half of using this product went as expected with any moisturizer. it felt firming and it applied well underneath makeup. however by the end of the second week of using it, i broke out with cystic acne on my left cheek, where i have never had acne before in my life i am. that is why i am leaving a-star review. it cosmetics should stick with makeup i actually enjoy their cc cream. who knows, maybe they try to break you out intentionally so you will buy their foundation.",negative

i love this cleanser!! even though the bottle says they recommend to wash your face at night only because if you did that then why do you need to wash it in the morning i use it both morning and night and i live how gentle it is on my skin and makes me skin feel soo perfect!!,positive
"this serum adds a lovely glow. there are two buts, however. the annoyingly messy pump, which is not a deal breaker, and it makes me breakout. have tried it several times, and within hours of use, a few pimples on my cheeks andor chin. the glow is not worth it for me.",neutral
it is not necessarily that these are bad... i just like the other eye patches ptr offers better. i purchased the cucumber at one point when the k patches were out of stock. the cucumber masks are cooling and refreshing feeling... but did nothing for the puffiness under my eyes in the mornings. after repurchasing the k i really could tell how big of a difference there is between the two sets of masks. i will not be repurchasing the cucumber.,neutral

"blends well with moisturizer without turning orange i have fair sensitive skin, did not because breakouts and last for- days with only drops i will definitely order again",positive

"i was so excited to get this, but as i was trying to open the weirdly complex package, it flew out and completely busted all over my bathroom floor. it alsolooks as if there was leaking inside of it before it fell. the box has small, blue stains. so disappointing. i will not buy again.",negative

overhyped is not that good overpriced it dosent do much of a difference,negative

"wish i could give this zero stars. this smells like fish, i could not get over the overwhelming odor. tried to wash it off to no avail.",negative
"i originally loved this product. i will be positive first... my skin loved these drops. my texture improved while using it. the problem is the tan you get... it is great if you are already tan, but if you are not careful with blending, you get a fake, orange look on top of your tan. you can see yelloworange lines on your neck if you are not careful as well. it also accentuated my hyperpigmentation. it does give a great glow and if you use it to help deepen a tan you already have then this is for you. if you have no tan and try to use this, i do not see it working well unless you are ok with the fake orange look. also i have some hyperpigmentation from my second child. these drops accentuated the hyperpigmentation on my face which i really did not like.",neutral
"sigh. i really wanted to love this, i figured it would be great because it is by algenist. i liked it at first and i do not hate it but i definitely will not be repurchasing. it is got a light, milky consistency which is nice, but it feels a bit oily going on so probably not great for oily skin and somehow also feels a little drying if i slacked at all on hydrating skincare products that day. otherwise i do like how it feels on my skin, it is not at all matte and leaves a light glowy? finish. however... it does not wear well under makeup-- now that it is getting warmer outside i am noticing that if you sweat at all and try to dab it away, your makeup is probably going to come right off if you are wearing this underneath it. it is a very small amount of product for the price and quality the oz bottle is smaller than my palm and i have fairly small hands, it causes flashback in photos, and leaves a moderate white cast i am assuming it would not be very noticeable if you are pailvery fair, but i do not know i am only around yneutral olive and it still made me look kind of ghosty which is why i normally only buy chemical sunscreens. overall i would not recommend it",negative
"did not work. maybe it is just me but i used it for months and nothing has changed. i personally recommend the ordinarys serum, its cheaper and i applied it for a week and it actually made my acnes and black heads much better.or maybe it is because i stopped wearing mask a couple weeks ago because school is over. however it is just my experience and opinion.",neutral
strong smell is unbearable! i literally coughed for the entire time. it is so strong i inhaled it as soon as i opened the packaging and then i could not stop coughing. it also stung and my skin read. but will not continue so not sure if it works.,negative
"at first, i thought i might have found my perfect sunscreen. but, alas, no. i initially liked the smell, slight glow, texture, and high zinc oxide content. however, the more i used the product, i noticed several downsides. even though i do not use foundation, as others have noted, the product pills quite a bit. in addition, even though there is not a noticeable white cast, because i have a slightly darker skin tone, there is still a tiny bit of one. the biggest problem with the product, though, is the lack of information regarding its short shelf life. i bought it in march of, but the expiration date was january,, less than a year. i talked to three people at sephora but could not get a satisfactory response as to why the expiration date was so short. something about the natural ingredients? then i emailed the glow company three times, and no one responded to my question. i like to order products online, so i do not want to risk buying this product with such a short shelf-life. i do not think i will repurchase.",neutral
"favorite of the countless moisturizers i have tested for extended periods. this is stupid expensive, but i just keep coming back. somehow, it achieves the perfect combination of slightly mattified yet thoroughly moisturized skin. with most moisturizers, i either have to blot a couple times throughout the day, or it is not moisturizing enough and i have to add another product to my already-considerable routine. not so with this. having a spot for the spatula is a surprisingly great aspect, considering most products require you to store the spatula separately which results in me losing half of them. i probably come back to this once a year. it would be constant repurchasing but for the near-physical pain that the price tag causes me.",positive
i got to say it more work than whitening strips and i honestly did not see much of a difference. i think it is crap.,negative
"its great if you are looking for a rich moisturizing cream for under. there is a small amount of fragrance but not perfumey, my skin does feel super soft after use but i have finished the whole bottle and not noticing anything special happening with my skin- mind you it is not breaking me out either. i loved the packaging but the pump was faulty and i had to find alternatives to apply the cream so i did not have to put my fingers inside, i hate having to put my hand to take the cream from the jar and specifically bought this because it had a pump applicator. for that alone i am giving stars instead of.",neutral
the packaging is beautiful and love that you can buy refills. the things is the moisturizer is a little to thick and it made my skin breakout.,neutral
"have used this religiously for years but will never buy again now that formula has changed. it is green, i had to exfoliate hands times after applying and they are still stained. absolute disaster of a product.",negative
"hydrating formula, but other than that, this is a hard pass for me. first off, the jar design is impossible because you have to stick your finger straight into the jar to access any product once the jar is less than two-thirds full, to the point where product is getting under your inevitably germ-prone finger nails. gross! they give you a silly plastic spoon, but it is impractical to use. other than hydration, did not notice a difference with fine lines or dark undereyes after more than months use.",negative
i found this product clogs my pores. i have larger pores and once i started using this product they seemed to get filled and left them looking like blackheads. i do not recommend this product. i will probably try a serum.,negative

"east enough to apply but make sure to get the right shade for your natural tone. i am extremely pale with very yellow undertones and have been tanning using the st tropez express tan for years, but decided it was time to try something other than a mousse as i hate the consistency and the transfer is awful. this has zero transfer, the initial smell is nice when applying but does turn quite biscuity the day after. everything was good aside from the fact that i left it on for about hours, went to bed looking decent after showering, and woke up a dark orange. will be exchanging for the medium shade.",neutral
"amazing. fantastic. incredible. i have nothing but great things to say. i love the light scent it is not overpowering, but makes me feel so relaxed. my skin has been noticeably brighter, smoother, and more even. i use tretinoin and this helps keep the dry flakes at bay without exacerbating my acne.",positive
it is a bit to oily for my combination skin. throughout the day it will seep into my eyes making them watery and i am not able to see well. i have been applying a super thin layer in hopes that will change but no luck. i would recommend this for dryer skin in my opinion. the packaging is great and i do like the dewy finish it leaves. just not my fave.,neutral

"i wanted to love this mask so much because it looked so good. i put this mask on just like it told me to and as soon as it was sitting on my face for minutes it started to tingle and burn my skin. it is not hydrating at all, it feels like it has peppermint or something in it. it made my skin very red and irritated! do not use if you have sensitive skin.",negative

"i received this complimentary by the brand, however am genuinely so happy with it. i use retin-a micro a few timesweek, however cannot apply it anywhere near my eyes without it causing irritation. this eye cream however is so much more gentle, and works well. it has a lot unique balm-to-cream consistency to it that just melts into your skin without feeling heavy or tacky. a little goes a long way, so you can expect this small jar to last for awhile! i put this on in the evenings as the last step in my evening skincare regimen, and so far am very happy with it.",positive
"it will regulate your oil, whether your run oily or dry or somewhere in-between. it will brighten your skin and feel good. it will help fade blemishes and reduce hyperpigmentation. it will go on light, absorb quickly and keep your pores looking minimal. it will play nice with the rest of your routine like a true collaborator. and on and on and on.niacinamide could solve world peace and climate change and everything else if you just gave it a chance on the presidential ticket.",positive

"i received this product from influenster. at first i was excited to try it because i have stubborn dark spots on my face. after about a week of using this product, my face began to broke out. there was no change in my dark spots even after a month of using. although this product did not burn my skin, it did have a cooling effect. i feel like for a product that is so expensive, this product should have been better. i would not recommend this at all.",negative
worst product ever!!! i do not know why people think this is so good. maybe i got a bad batch? it made my face orange in the morning and blotchy!,negative

"i am not completely sold on this product and i do not see the hype. i was so excited for it because i love farmacy and what the brand stands for and their other products but for some reason this product does not do wonders for my skin like it does for other people. it does not do much. just leaves a tingling sensation behind for a bit, that is it. in the morning i wake up and i do not notice much of difference in my skin. i am really trying to give a try but after a few months of owning it i cannot seem to get the same results.",neutral
"i totally get that buying and using a drunk elephant product sounds enticing and exciting, but honey if you have pimple prone or sensitive skin, i would steer clear of this. i think it would be a great fit for someone with normal-dry skin that is not too concerned with breakouts i have normal-combo skin. i really appreciate how it is fragrance free though! but it just feels oily, like it sits on my skin. it is also dollars in canada but bumps up to with tax and for the quantity you are getting i feel ripped off. i know some people with oily skin that have a totally different experience with this cream, so make sure to read a lot of reviews- i just wanted to share my experience",neutral
"i received this lab sample complimentary from alpyn beauty. i liked the texture, smell, and feel of the peel. unfortunately, i wore it for only minutes before washing it off and it made my skin quite red.",negative
this serum has a nice texture and feels nicely hydrating on the skin. it also has great ingredients that have some hydrating and plumping effects. unfortunately there is not really a place for this in my routine as i will not replace my nighttime retinol serum which will give me better results than this. plus there is no added fragrance in this but it smells like lemon brisk to me and i cannot get over it!,neutral
when people say this cleanser is stripping and drying as heck it is. unless your face is like butter and dripping in oil this cleanser is for you. i have a very oily t zone and normaldry cheeks. and for the love that is holy do not use on dry skin or dry normal parts. i would use it on normal areas on my faces and i would have instant dry patches. anyone with dry skin run as fast as you can from this product. i am very slowly using this product once and a while because i do not want to waste it but only use it on oilier parts of my skin.,negative

"i did not like this product. it is an exfoliator but it did not feel like it was doing too much. i have used much cheaper products that actually exfoliated my face. the smell is extremely strong as well, which i did not like. it smells like very fake strawberries. after using the product i would moisturize like normal, but my face near my chin would peel as if i was sunburnt.",negative
"i was skeptical at the beginning but i am pleasantly surprised, i am seeing noticeable results only after couple times using it, i am excited for the improvement in my skin and i will keep using these patches to keep my skin looking radiant and healthy.",positive
loving this product!! i initially pick this up with my rewards points and fell in love. i purchased it after using the small trial sizes i had. purchased the full size and could not be happier.,positive
i do not like it at all. it smells gross and i hate the feeling of it on my face,negative
"i really wanted to like this serum. i love the idea of an aha serum to improve the skins clarity and texture. i love the packaging and gorgeous purple bottle. however, i am pretty sure this serum caused me to break out in tiny little whiteheads. i am sad to report this! i have somewhat sensitive skin so maybe that is why this product does not agree with my skin.",negative
"this is a really strong exfoliant, be sure to patch test first. i use it once per week for no more than ten minutes, followed by hyaluronic acid b and my moisturizer, and please, sunscreen always. i am using it since about two months and it helped with my sun spots and other blemishes, my skin looks cleared and glowy. just be responsable when you use it.",positive
"it is okay it is not the best thing ever. i am not really good at applying fake tanner but this was a big mess it made my skin super blotchy and i just did not enjoy that. but, it you want a tan super bad go to the drugstore or online or whatever and search jergens natural tan lotion best thing on earth and makes your tan look so natural",negative
"i have tried a lot of facial sunscreens that feel too thick and do not easily absorb into my skin, so i was very glad that i was able to try nudestix nudescreen daily mineral veil spf. the formula moisturizes, acts as a makeup primer, and offers protection from sun damage. i often have quite oily skin, and i was thrilled to find out that daily mineral veil made my skin look matte in addition to moisturizing and protecting from uv rays. two more great benefits are that it is reef safe so you can feel good about using it, and it is also one of the few mineral sun screens i have tried that does not leave a white cast at all. i would gladly recommend this to others and the only reason i am giving stars rather than is because i am very fair and ideally need a higher spf.",positive
this is a gentle yet cleansing face wash. it does not dry out my skin nor does it have a strong scent. although i really recently received a free sample i have been using cleanser for a few years ago and have not tried anything else. the single pump dispenses just enough allowing the bottle to last you a little while.,positive
i love coola and had high hopes. i am fair. like paper white. i was surprised how light i was after my first application. maybe i was being too cautious. i did use a mitt for the application. which was a first for me and loved it. totally recommend using that for any self tanners. after the second used i could see more color. so maybe it is a good thing that it is not so in your face likehello i self tanned last night. but.... i think the smell is so strong. i do not know how people think there is not one. it is totally self tanner smell. and it gets stronger!!! no way it smells of coconut. which is disappointing. but it is to be expected with any self tanner i am assuming. not sure if i would buy again but it seems like a lot of product and dispenses nice.,neutral
"this is a nice product, meaning that it is not sticky, absorbs well, and has no overpowering scent, however i feel like it has not done anything for my skin. probably will not buy again as there are other ordinary products that produce better results for my skin type. price is low though, so probably would not hurt to try.",neutral
"i do not love this product. i have oily-combination skin so i thought this would be perfect for a day cream during the summer, however it still leaves my skin feeling on the dry tight side if i do not use a lot, when i use more i feel a stinging sensation. i also am not a fan of the smell. disappointed because i really love their barriair cream but it does not seem to be on the website anymore.",negative
"this cream definitely leaves you naturally radiant and glowing, as well as moisturized, but it does pill, which is annoying especially for the price. for that reason, i think it would be better used as a night cream than under makeup.",positive
it is gentle on the skin. you do not need a lot of it. skin feels refreshed and clean after use. you use it. the smell of pineapple and papaya is light.,positive
"i love sheet masks, but cannot say i have seen a huge difference after using this one. i like them more for the self care moment and it was refreshing. it definitely did not hurt my skin.",neutral
"i think i would like this if i could have gotten a shade, but everything was sold out except translucent. the translucent makes me look sickly pale and dry. would not buy this if you have any sort of tan.",negative
i was disappointed in this product. wanted to love it because of all the great reviews but take your skin type into consideration. does not work on oily skin!! made me so greasy.,negative
this did nothing for me. everyone is experience is different but i would not recommend. the lady at sephora told me that this can also be used to remove left over makeup but it did not. did not really see any difference in my skin. too expensive for something that did not work or do what it is describes. star is based on my personal experience just mainly being that said product did not work for me.,negative
"my favourite part of the day is using this serum. the lift sculptor. it is amazing! my skin is so fresh when i wake up the next day, i am obsessed with this product. it is pricey but worth it. try it!",positive
disappointed in this product considering how much i love other gr products. feels a bit sticky and i think there is better products on the market. i will finish this bottle because it is pricey but will not repurchase,neutral
does absolutely nothing. as in a huge waste of money.,negative
"ok, so this is sad for me to write because i really love a lot of the ingredients in this and the consistency. it preformed well for me and i loved the scent without it being a fragrance. i figured essential oils, natural right. well with continues use i started to develop really itch areas around my outer eye and no i was not washing my eyes with this but it will overlap by brows when rinsing. so i changed my eye cream, my toner, i changed everything except this. the problem continued... it was not until i started researching deeper that i realized my issue was the essential oils. such a bummer, if you do not have sensitive skin go for it! if you do avoid fragrance and essential oils like the plague!!",neutral
in my opinion this is not the best product for body tanning. it is best for faceneck area. this is because the amount of drops you would need for full body would be a large amount and also i find the product hard to create a consistent tan on large areas as it goes on clear and the next day looks streaky.however i love it for my face and neck and sometimes arms. i use st. tropez products for body and this for face.,neutral
"this product was recommended to me during a beauty treatment at sephora. i have combination skin and large visible pores. i found this product a bit too heavy and hard to wash off from my face. for this reason i tend to only use it in the shower. it is not a bad cleanser, however for the price i expected it to be better. i would not repurchase, and i much prefer fresh soy face cleanser instead as it is so much easier to wash off and removes even eye make-up gently.",neutral
"i definitely noticed an improvement in my fine lines, although i hoped it would brighten my dark circles, but for what it did for my wrinkles is already amazing! i love the feel of this eye cream, although i do wish it were a little thicker, but i mean it is a good eye cream and i would definitely purchase it again.",positive
"i loved this in my s and i used the entire jar. in my late s however, this was not moisturizing enough for me. if you are younger and just starting out with eye creams, i highly recommend this one as it works well under makeup and is very nice.",neutral
"got this a while back as a sample. the texture is nice, but it is a lightweight cream and does not deliver enough hydration for me. it has not made any differences under my eyes either. i cannot see why anyone would spend cad on.oz.",negative
"i got a nice size sample of this, and was so excited to try it out. i have seen her products all over the internet. as with all hyped products, i was kind of let down.this is overpriced, and while moisturizing, just ok. do not expect anything other than a nice light cream. no scent which is a plus, but i fail to see how this warrants such an expensive price tag. clarins remains my favorite for eye creams.",neutral
"this is the third full size bottle i have purchased and unfortunately it has to be returned. the oil smells rancid! it has the odor of old castor oil or motor oil. just last week i received the mini bottle from a sephora play box and that oil too has the same smell. the original formula was odorless and a miracle worker. i do not know if the bottles are sitting in a warehouse too long, the company is trying a new formula, or they are cutting it with a lesser quality oil either way the smell makes me doubt how effective the product will be. i would recommend times over the old formula but whatever this new concoction is i refuse to use.",negative

"eye see you fine lines, dark circles, and under eye puffiness. today i have a review for a new eye cream i have been testing for a few weeks. this firming eye treatment is formulated with both antioxidants, vitamins c e, to act as a barrier of protection against free radicals improve your skins resilience. additionally, along with vitamin a, this eye cream supports natural collagen production, smoothes fine lines, protects against fine lines. my concerns for under eyes are dark circles, puffiness, fine line preventionsmoothing. this eye cream is opaque white with a slippery silicone texture. it absorbs into my under eye area easily wears well under makeup. it has an enjoyable, slightly sweet scent. i find this eye cream to be moisturizing but not the most moisturizing i have used. i tend to see fine lines in the inner corners of my eyes when i laughsmile luckily they are not bad but after using this for several weeks i did not find any difference in their appearance. my skin does look firmer feel moisturized but other than that i have not noticed any other anti-aging results. this is quite pricey at. per. oz but luckily you need only a little so it will last awhile if you do splurge on it. i did not see enough results to justify splurging on it but overall it is a good eye cream. any changes and i will update you. i would rate it..",neutral
this is a great product for lightening scars without overworking the skin. i started using this once a day until i built a tolerance to do twice a day. you need about pumps on a soft cotton round and that will do your whole face. been using this for just over months and my skin is smooth and clear.,positive
"i am an avid user of night creams and love love love the results of gives me. but i was an absolute shock when i tried this wonderful pillow cream. it gives such a wonderful scent but that is not the best part of it oh, the results of gives your skin truly does gives you the look of complete you rested skin and just to let you know what your skin will feel like, it will literally feel like the cream itself. i was surprised and in awe when i felt my face in the morning and it was softer than i had ever felt it before. i am now and have not had my face feel this soft since i was about years old. this is an absolute must have if you wear makeup everyday or have a hectic life where you do not get as much rest as you should.",positive
"ehhhh i do not know about this one. i have been using it for weeks now and i have not seen much of a difference in my skin. it is a nice toner, does not break me out..but it does not make me glow. after i have washed my face, it is a nice refreshing additive to my routine but that is about it. it is neither hydrating nor pore tightening, it is not doing anything noticeable to my blemishes. probably going to return.",negative
"i was not nearly as impressed by the results as other reviewers. good genes worked great after the first two uses, but then puttered out. i have used other lactic acids that have worked better.",neutral
i have normal skin and do not have any problems with it. this cleansing balm has left my skin congested. it is too thick and leaves residue which my face does not like.,negative
i was really excited to try this product! just did not get any great results after using the whole bottle over time. maybe just not for me?,neutral
"this made me break out so bad. i am prone to acne, and this accelerated it. i will be returning.",negative
i had heard great things and wanted to like this....but it felt like putting any other sunscreen on my face it stayed sticky and was shiny more than a natural glow.,negative
i personally did not love this product it is very thick and felt heavy on the skin. left your skin feeling tacky afterwards as well. it did leave your skin hydrated. but i did not love the smell. it smelled like nutmeg to me. just was not for me.,neutral
trying out this new vitamin c eye cream and right away i like the bottle and how it comes out the nozzle which makes it easy to apply. does not have a super overwhelming smell of citrus either and feels nice,neutral
i did not notice any difference. i still use it since it was over days and cannot return it.,negative
"okay...this stuff does have a different textureapplication that most eye creams, but if you can be patient with application, it is amazing! i have found that it is helpful to dab it on and let it heat up on your skin then tap in on do not rub and make sure your skin and fingers are dry. it seems like the oils in this do not play well with water it gets real weird if your skin or fingers are wet. i have used lots of different eye creams, my favorite is to mix the two drunk elephant eye creams and i would if money was not object, but this is a very close second for me and considering the price point...maybe better?",positive
"amazing product, my face is always so dry and tight after washing it and i use this alone and it is great. my only problem is the fact that the little rose piece get stuck in the hole and blocks the timer from coming out. another thing is the price honestly, i use it twice a day most days as recommended on the bottle and it is almost gone and i have not even had it for months. i will probably continue looking for a new toner. i just wish it was a little more product for you.",positive
"been using the inflam-aging night repair treatment for about one month now and i do not see a difference. i have sensitive skin and i did not breakout, so that is a total plus. but other than that my previous night treatment was just as good and less expensive.",neutral

"i am using it every night for a month now. and it looks makes my under eye smoother and looks healthier. the best part is it does not gave me milia, which i am super prone to and it just nicely moisturizes my under eye really well. i feel like i need to empty this first before i can comment on its brightening side. but for now, i am loving how its doing with my eye area.",positive

"works great! love the feeling it gives my skin. but there is one flaw to this product, it is the packaging. i find sometimes too much comes out, and then a few hours later there are some crusties around the hole where the product comes out. so i find i have to clean the packaging everyday so it does not get gross looking.",positive
"hold my skin, got shiny and keep it hydrate and i love it. i use it every day to times before make up after make up you must guys have it. it is truly keep my skin look glow",positive
this is a very beneficial eye cream! it is very smooth and a little dab will be enough to use each time. i use it on my face and feel a difference with how soft my skin is!,positive
"it is a nice moisturizer. it does have temporary plumping effects due to the humectants and moisturizing aspects of the formula. it is not the miracle worker instagram advertises it to be. i assume if you have dryer skin and do regularly get facials that you may love this because it is an easy way to dose your face with much needed moisture.what i do not like about it is the effects are temporary, it has not improved my skin, they tell you to wipe it off with a tissue do not unless you want to redo your makeup, leaves tissue behind on your face, and the peppermint oil when paired with the tube packaging makes it seem like toothpaste. i know i am going to get trough this whole tube in about weeks, using it only every morning, i may just start using it only under my eyes and my whole face does not need what this offers. overall just ok. i love skin care staples but this will not be a staple piece for me.",neutral
"this is my first cleansing balm and i love it! previously i was using makeup remover or a micellear water followed by a basic cerave cleanser. i do not know what it is about my face, but i always had a hard time getting all my makeup off even with both of those products. i always felt like i needed to use the cleanser twice and sometimes i would go back for a second pass with the micellear water after the cleanser. now that i have switched to this cleansing balm and the milk vegan cleanser i do not have that problem anymore! like i said, this was my first cleansing balm so i had to learn that you really do need to warm it up in your hands before putting it on your face. otherwise it has a slightly waxy texture out of the container. once its on, its silky smooth! you also need the water to be warm when you wash it off otherwise it stays on the skin.",positive
i really thought i would like this product. i love a good sleeping mask. last night i tried it and it just did not work for me. as i put the mask on it became white and tacky. i just maybe in the morning it will change. nope my face was still stickytacky. i would not recommend at all.,negative
pretty good! i have been using it for a few nights and have seen a subtle difference in my dark spots. i can only imagine what my skin will look like in a few weeks!,positive
"i got this in a supergoop! minis bag i purchased and i definitely plan to buy the full-size when i run out. a little goes a long way! i have not had any issues with breakouts, and i have really sensitive skin. i feel like my skin is super soft when i use it. it is lightweight and i never feel like i am wearing sunscreen with this! i also love the smell! the perfect addition to any skin care routine.",positive
"this product works wonders, but the bottle top was faulty and broke. i have bene using this for a week and can already see and feel the difference in my skins hydration! seriously awesome and amazing price too! but, the bottle top has not ever screwed on just right, and today it spilled all over the inside of my makeup bag. wish i could give it the stars it deserves, but its packaging is vital to being user friendly. i look forward to better packaging and a better experience in the future!",neutral

"generally do not have dry skin, but developed dry patches on forehead after a dry windy winter. purchased this moisturizer after my previous cream did not resolve dryness. i must be missing the hype on this one. it temporarily moisturizes my skin for a clean feel, but i find the moisture dissipates within a couple of hours. layering the cream or re-applying helps, but its not really ideal. it has not helped my forehead clear up either. it is average, probably works well if your skin is uncomplicated and not affected by environment.",neutral
"while this product is good for your skin, it is a bit of a problem when it comes to absorption... it does not absorbs as quickly as my other serums, takes over an hour to do so and does not mix too well with my makeup mac and other products... to remedy this, i use it in the mornings when i do not have to go out to really give it a chance to enter my skin, but because of that, i know the results will not be as good as someone who uses twice a day...i also do not wear it at night for this reason, as it sticks to the pillows and sheets and becomes a waste as soon as you rest your head sideways i am torn on if i would recommend it, as i know it might work for others but i will not be buying again.",neutral
"not really my jam. it smells expired. it gives me olive oil vibes. super thick oil and i am not sure if it does anything. i am still going to use it on bath days in the dead of winter. as long as i have a candle to smelli am happy i tried it, but i will not buy it again. get the b oil, its bomb.",negative
"the shade deep is not close to what is pictured. i love a no makeup look, but this cream formula is too thick. i should not feel like i have layers of product on my face for a no makeup look. plus, it left me looking gray. i agree that they need to do better with shade ranges especially for deep-dark skin tones. for reference i am a in black up tinted moisturizer. as for coverage it was too much for a light application. i do not have dark circles to cover, but my aim was to achieve a better than my skin look. hard pass for me.",negative
"i have met few moisturizers over the years that i did not like, but i just cannot quite put my finger on how i feel about this one. i could put it on bone dry skin and it does not feel like it absorbs, let alone when i put it on after the rest of my skincare routine. it feels too heavy for daytime but it is not that thick of a cream. when i put it on at night, even the tiniest amount, i feel like i have to rub it in forever for it to not appear white on my skin. it just kind of feels tacky. i am disappointed because i have been curious about this brand but this moisturizer just did not work for my skin or make my face feel more hydrated after a week using it. not for me, but might be for you!",neutral
"giving stars because it was just o.k. i might have liked it more had i not tried dr. brandts other exfoliator prior to this one. i bought this instead because i did not need the anti-aging aspect of the other exfoliator but this one did not do nearly the work of the other! little less expensive but i would still recommend the brand, just the other exfoliator. mainly use on my nose for large pores and blackheads!",neutral
works amazing. i am in love with this product. used once now i cannot live without!!,positive

i am not a big fan of the smell when i put these in my face it is hydrating though. and i do not know how many percent is the retinol so i do not know if it is strong enough to erase some of the blemishes i have. the only thing i like is how quickly it dries but leaves my face hydrated. but still i do not like the smell even if its dry i can still smell the product.,neutral
"this is my holy grail product. i have re-purchased it many times! i love this one because the cherry scent is nice, but the original is great too. it removes my make up, cleanses my face, and makes my skin feel awesome. it is gentle and is the only make up remover that removes waterproof mascara and eyeliner with no trouble. please never stop making this!",positive
"got the sample sized in a sephora play! box years ago and have purchased the full size product multiple times since. an easy to apply, gentle yet effective physical exfoliation. after a few eases it can get a little grimy but easy to fix by just wiping the product off. could see it making an amazing first exfoliant for someone just starting a routine or a great gym bag travel addition",positive

"i bought this product on amazon and i started using it once or twice a week... i cannot remember, because all i read about using retinol and how your skin needs adjustment, etc. right now i am at times a week and about to go for days. never had a problem with it like dry skin or purging at all, but i do use a very good moisturizer and i do not use this product the days i use a chemical exfoliator. i noticed that the hyperpigmentation of my monthly zits were fading away a lot faster than when i was not using it and that it makes my skin look brighter the next morning. i have not noticed much about my fine lines to be quite honest but it definitely works for those acne spots and overall skin appearance. i am also hoping that using this, makes it easier for my skin to adjust to tretinoin or retin-a which is the prescription form of retinol to help combat fine lines since that was my biggest reason to use this product but it did not deliver the results i was expecting. but overall i think it is a good product at an awesome price and it does have an earthy smell but i do not mind it at all.",positive
"what a game changer! i pair it with the night cream and my skin has never looked better. i saw immediate results in my skins moisture levels, pore size, brightness, and my hormonal acne scars have started to fade. it is preventing future breakouts too! the fragrance is not strong and the cream does not leave your face sticky or oily. it does what it claims to do and i will definitely continue to buy this.",positive
i am very disappointed in this product. i have mildly sensitive skin but i felt good giving this cream a try. it has a good combination of ingredients that are usually nurturing to skin. however this stuff inflamed my skin and made it read and stinging. definitely will not be using this again.,negative
"works but smells like lemony kitchen cleaner. would not re-purchase, even though it does work as a good first cleanse. did not irritate my skin.",negative
i used it once and it caused these tiny red bumps all over my under eyes and eyelids. it was super sticky too. my boyfriend usually never comments on my face but when i put this on he said that my under eyes looked really dark that day. i will finish using this for my body because i heard caffeine is good for skin in general but just maybe not for around my eyes.,negative
i really like this cleanser. it leaves my skin really soft after use. i love that it also removes makeup. i am impressed that this coconut based cleanser does not leave the skin feeling greasy. i recommend this for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser.,positive
"while i did not see any difference in my lines, this serum absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. it is very hydrating and i enjoyed using it.",positive
it is a good moisturizer esp for my drier skin during the winter time but honestly the smell is so strong. it literally smells like i smeared honey on my face and it does not dissipate right away. i can still smell it after an hour of it on my face. so if you like the smell of honey right under your nose it is a good moisturizer but honestly for me it is a bit distracting and i cannot help but to notice the honey smell the entire time.,neutral
i really wanted to love this because of the price and great things i have heard about rose hip oil. i applied this at night mixed with my moisturizer.the pros are that my face felt very hydrated and smooth along my cheeks and chin and forehead. the cons are that i woke up with a bunch of red bumps on my nose some whiteheads. my nose tends to have larger pores get oilier so i knew this was a possibility. i am very sad and wish my nose looked like the rest of my face. sadly this has happened multiple times when i try using this oil. will probably use the rest on my neck and hands. also- this would def not work for me during the day because it is too thick and does not sink into my face. at night i think its fine. the smell does not bother me and i do not think it made my face a different color. i hope this can help someone else and i am very jealous because the price is great.,neutral
"i used this product and it stung my face, the fragrance is too strong. this smells like la mer but much stronger. i just do not recommend this it does nothing good to my face",negative
"i received this eye serum complementary for review purposes. i love the packaging as well as the feel of the product. it is very lightweight and moisturizing. after consistent use for about weeks, i have not noticed any difference in the dark circles under my eyes.",neutral
the best moisturizer! it has no scent so it will not irritate your face and it keeps my skin so hydrated. i absolutely love it!! it is lightweight and does not leave your face feeling sticky. i received this product complimentary for review purposes.,positive
i give this oil stars for the smell alone. it lightly smells of jasmine and i just want to put it all over my body. i have only been using this for a few weeks and it has not negatively affected me but i am not sure of the positives because i use so many facial products. i will repurchase though for the scent alone. it is a product i enjoy using.,positive
you can feel this working instantly! the satisfaction when you put it on and it starts sloughing off everything on your skin is next level. your skin feels baby-butt soft! i use this about once a week and have seen wonderful results. it was on sale over the holidays and i stocked up! and its a top recommendation to all of my friends!,positive
"i got to try this product from my complimentary voxbox. i was really excited to try it however, it did not do much result wise. i have combination skin and usually use witch hazel toner after i wash my face. i began using this- times a week and it did not do much for my routine. my face after did feel more clean but more so stripping all oils from my face which made me even greasier after. what i would say is if i had a pimple this did help burn the bacteria and help it reduce quicker that average. one other thing i would say is that this does not have a flattering smell.",neutral
i just used this product for the first time. i got the sample size. this product leaves my skin smooth enough but i do not see any difference in comparison to other peels from other brands. not sure if i would buy as price will be the deal breaker for my decision if the do the same work. un,positive
i have been really enjoying using this cleanser it is not stripping it does not leave my skin feeling dried out it removes most makeups except for waterproof products and it is safe around my eyes. the little bits in it are not scraping or scratching it gently exfoliates without beads or seeds.,positive
potent amazing! i would start by using xweek especially if you are using other actives and acids maybe even every other week. there is a slight scent but the serum is smooth upon application. gifted by farmacy beauty,positive
waste of money. did nothing to blackheads and pores.,negative
i received free a small sample of the cream as my birthday gift. i think it is ok.. very soft and hydrating. not too oily but the feeling did not stay. i still ended up oily by the afternoon.. worked ok with my daily routine but not my makeup. i will give it to my sister who has drier skin,neutral
"did nottt like this formula. it had a thick, greasy feel to it. the exfoliating medium feel sharp and scratchy, but not evenly distributed. did not wash off clean. tried sticking it out for two weeks but i continued to feel oily and see whiteheads after using it. did not notice smoother or brighter skin but rather the opposite!",negative
"i really hoped this would be everything i hoped for... wrong. it was horrible. thick, did not blend well and the color fair was actually a light orange tint. i went back to sephora and returned it.",negative
i was so excited to try this because i love biossance. i used it for about a month to see if there would be any difference and i did not notice any difference in my skin at all. the consistency of the serum is nice and the smell is not bad but i cannot recommend due to price and not seeing any difference.,neutral
"i got a trial size of this and within a couple weeks i decided i love it! i went on a trip while i was using it and it really impressed me. the place i went has really dry air compared to where i live and that usually does a number on my face, it makes my nose and cheeks crazy dry. even in my home state i tend to have some dryness issues in the same spots. this moisturizer compared to my usual kept me moisturized and radiant for my whole trip! it even seemed to help my acne since i usually break out when i travel but not this time and this was my only changed product that i used. even when i got home it was not too much, it absorbs well and does not make me feel sticky. i am also in love with the smell. it has a light dreamsicle smell which to me is very nostalgic and generally really pleasant since fruity and dessert type smells are my favorite in beauty products.",positive
i followed the good reviews and tried once. it is a total waste of money!!! it cannot clean anything. the texture is so weird like mashed soybean. every time i used it it cannot clean anything off my face. my skin type is combination. err just image having mashed soybean all over your face. do not waste your money!! any product in a drug store would be much better than less but only cost of the price.,negative
"man, the reviews on this were so great...i thought i would finally found my cleansing balm match so i finally part ways with micellar water. unfortunately, i found the scrub too rough and abundant, even after thinning out with water. i expected way less scrub. had to return.",neutral
"i am usually not sensitive to smells and love dermalogica products. this smells like paint thinner. also, the product did nothing to my face except dry it out slightly the next morning. do not recommend.",negative
wanted to like this product a lot as a lot of people say it is amazing.... immediately after incorporating it into my makeup routine i broke out all over!! it may work for some but i would suggest trying it in a small area of your face to see if your skin likes it!,negative
this cream did not help with my under circles or to tighten my under eye area. it was an okay cream. still searching for a good eye cream.,negative
smells nice and seems very hydrating for my first impression and my skin is more calmed down. a little bit goes a long way. cons are product was spilling out and part,neutral
"this is a great moisturizer however, if you have really dry skin i would not use it alone as it drys out your face. i personally loved layering this with my other moisturizers but by itself i would not recommend.",neutral
"takes my mascara off at night, but it always stings my eyes and makes them feel blurry for hours.",neutral
its not worth it to spend almost for this serum! nothing special.,negative
left oily on face so long time and strong alcohol. do not like it.,negative
"i am a religious masker and this is my favorite. i use glam glow, freshly farmacy and dr jart as well but this has the most noticeable consistent results with no sensitivity. i have acne, aging, sensitive, combination skin and while there is a temporary tingle upon first application it goes away almost instantly. my face is plump and glowing after minutes. it also helps bring dormant blemishes to the surface faster.",positive
i wanted to love this since jeffree star uses it but unfortunately it broke my face out so i could not even use if i wanted too. i did t even get the chance to really try it out but once.,negative
"healthy skin before using the product and within one day of using half a pea sized amount my face around my cheeks and nose was peeling everywhere. i do not have sensitive skin, dry in the winter but never peeling. this is a very strong retinol. it also smells terrible. terrible product. i suggest you get a sample at sephora and try it out before you waste money and damage your skin.",negative
such a great product! perfect primer and it gives a nice glow to your skin plus the sun protection. will definitely purchase again. oh it does pill if i rub it in too aggressively so i recommend patting it in.,positive
i usually do not use anything that has oil in it because i have such an acne prone skin and my skin produces enough oil. but i ran out of my skin care products so tried this sample. did not break out my skin. not a quench thirst type of cream but it protected my skin from drying out. though the smell can be a little overwhelming. smells like marshmallow.,positive
smells lovely and feels luxurious. really penetrates the skin. great last step to an evening routine.,positive
"satisfied with the product. i have normal to dry skin and i like it because it hydrates my skin, it is also not sticky. it gives a subtle glow to your skin. it makes the makeup look good on you later. no smell bad. no fragrance. i love it. good job to the brand.",positive
"i really wanted to love this product but it just was not as effective at clearing texture as the pc liquid. throughout using this, texture came back and never cleared. so as an effective product, well... it just was not. but i loved everything else about it! it absorbs really well and feels super refreshing. love the glass packaging too. so i would recommend this since everyone is skin is different and i know people who swear by it! just did not cut it for me.",neutral
"this avocado serum has lovely green creamy texture and has no scent, that is good for people who has problems with fragrance. i am using it more than a week and love it after each use, how it left me soothing and hydrated skin. this serum has non greasy texture and absorbs quickly into the skin. smoothen out skin texture and fine lines. i am loving this serum so far.",positive
"i bought this cleansing oil as i saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews, i had to try it out. it works and it smells quite herbal and nice. bu if i am comparing it to tatchas camellia oil cleanser, it scores lower. tatchas cleansing oil is more oily and does not water down as quickly. it definitely works but i feel like i use more of it because it is a little bit less oily and more watery.",neutral
"i cannot tell if this really works. the texture is like the smash box primer, felt a bit heavier so not good for oily skin. i am fact this broke me out a little. i did notice hydration. like a film that seals in moisture all day. skin did not look drastically better.",neutral
"if you are looking for a light-weight, tinted moisturizer with spf, this is not it. it is pretty thick. it is basically a full-coverage foundation with cc cream and spf. i have very oily skin, especially in these hot, humid months, and it will only keep your skin matte if you use a mattifying primer and setting powder over it. with that said, i do love how it looks on my skin, and it does not feel too heavy. i normally wear it cosmetics bye bye foundation full coverage moisturizer oil-free matte and wanted to try this cc version to compare. i think i will stick to the first one. it is a bit more creamer and easier to blend and just a little more matte--still have to wear a setting powder to keep it that way. i believe it is only available at the other beauty store. i am nc in macs studiofix foundation, got this in light, and the shade is perfect even with my face a little tan during the summer.",neutral
"i wanted to like this, but it is mediocre it is not matte, is not full coverage around light-medium coverage, oil broke through around hours after application, and increased my acne. when i first bought this i used it off and on during the summer and could not tell if this was the product causing me to break out. last week i unfortunately, but finally, got to the bottom of it. in the beginning of the week my skin was completely clear for the first time in a long time thursday i wore this during the day for minimal makeup, and by the time i took it off at night i had way too many new pimples. it is upsetting when you come so far with how great your skin looks, only to have one product destroy that progress.",negative
"when i received this product to try, i was pretty excited. i love this brand and this cleanser did not disappoint. it goes on smooth and gently removes all of my makeup even my mascara. i love that it did not dry out my skin or feel oily. i would definitely recommend this cleanser. for reference, i do have combo skin and am in my s.",positive

"the only brightening this did for my skin was make it bright red. would not recommend for sensitive skin, also stinks horribly.",negative
"i got a small size of this to try and out, and i will say it puts loads of moisture back into my skin and makes it very dewy and soft. however, it smells like pickles. i do not know if it is just the mini size or if it is the full size as well. the daily rose moisturizer i got smells like roses, so i know it is not my sense of smell being weird. it is not a super big deal since the smell fades away after a few minutes, but just thought i would put it out there. still a great product.",positive
i loved how thick and truly whipped the old formula was. this new formula feels less luxurious and similar to hundreds of other moisturizers. they took something truly special and made it plain. what a bummer. time to find a new moisturizer. i will not repurchase. bring back the old formula!,negative

"i received this product free from influencer for my honest review. this is a very nice cream moisturizer for the winter. it is thick without being super heavy. it goes well under makeup. it layers perfectly with my other skincare without pilling. my only complaint with it is the initial smell, it is not a scent because it is unscented, but it has a slight smell. it does go away quickly at least. overall it is a good product that i definitely would recommend.",positive
"yiiikes... i do not know what i was thinking, anything with deep exfoliating in the name does not belong in the regimen of a delicately balanced combo skin routine. also, if you are suspicious of micro beads, steer clear. smell is wonderful, should have been another clue, anything with too pleasant a smell always spells danger for anyone requiring as much balance as my skin does.",negative
the best acne dots i have tried and i have tried them all! as someone who gets the occasional bad break out i always count on peace out acne to get rid of spots fast! break outs do not stress me out any more because i know these dots will clear it up over night. truly a holy grail for my skin care routine.,positive
"i was really hoping kiehls ferulic brew facial treatment essence with lactic acid would boost my glow, smooth my textures, and reduce fine lines as it said but it just did not work for me. i have normal oily combination skin and i felt it made my skin more oilier and red. i tried this product for weeks but in the end i did not see any results. it might just be my skin type and could work great for others but it was not for me. i am still willing to use other kiehls products just not this one.",neutral

"complimentary from face gymi use a variety of face washes, but gel ones are my favorites and i am always ready to try a new one. i love the sleek and simple design of face gym electro-lite enzyme brightening gel cleanser. the tube has a qr code on the back to scan for face sculpting application methods. i really appreciate that it is so accessible right there on the tube rather than on the packaging or app which either i do not save or which requires extra effort. the cleanser has a nice gel texture that is not too thin and a little goes a long way. it works well at removing makeup residue as well as a morning cleanser, and it leaves the skin clean, fresh, comfortable and balanced. the scent is mild and barely detectable, but it reminds me of burned plastic, so it bothers me a bit but not enough to not use the product. overall i am very happy with this product and i would use it again.",positive
you have to use a lot just to clean one eye. i give it stars because my skin feels soft afterwards with no residue.,neutral
"this is the best eye cream i have used- recommended by skincare queen, caroline hirons. it is hydrating, brightens and does not because any irritation. i have already repurchased a second bottle which says a lot since i am normally always getting something new on the hunt for something that actually works! a new hg product for me.",positive

"ole henriksen wrinkle blur eye gel creme is the perfect addition to my skincare regimen! a vegan and cruelty free eye gel creme that plumps, cools, and brightens the under eyes. it goes on much like a hydrating primer, it soaks right in perfectly and leaves a smooth base for under my concealer, also great for nighttime routine as well. it contains bakuchiol ribbons which is a plant based retinol-- which i love! also contains peptides, proteins, and orchid stem cells which combat dark circles and improves elasticity. an incredible clean ingredient packed product to fight all signs of aging under eyes! beautiful packaging highlights the beautiful violet ribboned gel creme with and easy to use and control pump. priced just under a little bit goes a long way just a half a pump does both eyes. since starting i noticed smoothing of fine lines right under the eye, and a more plump hydrated eye area. i absolutely love the cooling feeling it instantly makes you feel and look more awake which i need! excited to continue using and see what else this magical product does for me!",positive

works well just left my skin kind of splotchy. i used it for a couple days and it definitely cleared up my skin but then my skin started getting red spots. it might just be a slight reaction to it.,neutral
"this is not my favorite cleanser ever. it kind of leaves my skin dry and tight afterwards and i have really oily skin. it did not really help prevent any breakouts for me, if anything it might have been the because for some. i do enjoy the gel-like texture of it and it lathers up nicely on the skin in a way where it does not create huge suds but just nice small foam bubbles. it smells cleanrefreshing. the packaging is super sleek. that is pretty much all i have to say about it though.",negative
i was really excited to try this cream- it has decent list of ceramides. what else it has? wax. this cream clogged my pores so badly just in a few days less than a week!. my face got covered with tiny little bumps. i ditched the cream and they were gone in a couple of weeks. do not recommend.,negative
"i recently got serious with wearing sunscreen regularly, and this one was highly recommended, so i purchased it, and i do not have any complaints. its light-weight, it does not have a strong scent, it works perfectly under makeup, and it does not break out my sensitive skin. when this one runs out i might try the unseen one, but i do not really see myself straying from supergoop anytime in the future.",positive
"was not a fan of it! i usually do not like fresh products, but a sephora worker recommended for my dry skin. the fragrance was really strong and was not pleasant for me. hydration was not enough and it did not do anything to my skin. in fact, it made my skin dryer considering i had to pile on so much of moisturizer then i usually would.",negative

i tried this two days in a row and my eyes are immediate puffy both times. i understand how it gets rid of dark circle and lines because it makes it puffy and that would fill in the lines and cover up the dark circles. its just too much for me my main problem is already puffiness and it makes my eyes difficult to open and also a little bit watery. i wish this worked,negative

this sort of has a similar feel and texture to the simple brand micellar water in that it leaves the skin feeling pretty dry after use. caudalie only uses grape water in their formulas and they claim that grape water is hydrating. its not my favourite option in sephora but it does the job in a pinch for a more natural alternative. the price is not worth it though.,neutral
"this has been an absolute favorite of mine since sephora started carrying it. i have dry, sensitive skin and magic cream is one of the few products that matches well for me, especially during the winter months. i love how it serves as a primer before i put on makeup and i equally love that i can use it as nourishing masque if i apply a fuller layer as part of my sunday skincare ritual. this just one of those products that will continually serve you well.",positive
"super excited to try this but will have to stop using it. i have combosensitive skin and every time i use the cleanser, my cheeks break out. when i stop using it for a couple days, my cheeks clear up. my cheeks rarely break out so i know it is a bad reaction to something in the cleanser- possibly the vit e which is oil-soluable and has given me trouble before.",neutral

received a small packet of this as a sample. pretty moisturizing and very thick consistency.. could not get passed the smell though. almost smelled like sunscreen and it lasted throughout the night until i washed it off next morning. would not purchase due to the smell..,neutral
i finally bit the bullet and decided to splurge on the small bottle since my skin was terribly dry due to the winter season. unfortunately after a couple days of using it my skin broke out. it did somewhat help moisturize my skin but my skin did not tolerate it. it has a slight fragrance to it and the packaging feels very heavy and luxurious.,negative

do not do a thing. even the brightening eye patches from pharmaprix work better and cost!,negative
this was too harsh for my skin. my skin got super dry in one spot and it turned dark like a burn and started to peel i was also breaking out. this might have had something to do with the fact that i use a daily microfoliant but i have no intention of giving up my exfoliant. once i stopped using the product my skin cleared up.,neutral

like it but not sure what it actually does. not sure if i would purchase again.,neutral
obsessed is an understatement. i definetly want to try the rich version of this eye cream because this one has made such a difference for the bags under my eyes and fine lines. i wear this throughout the daytime and night so i am thinking i will use this one as a daytime eye cream and the rich one as a night time.,positive

this is an amazing product! i am almost years old and use a cpap machine at night to breath. in the morning i have bags and wrinkles under my eyes. this product is the only product that i can use to get rid of these bags!!! do not use it with make-up... i tried to use my concealer with it but it did turn to white powder. after using it alone i noticed that my dark circles were not as dark as i thought!! i am so in love with this product. if you have not used anything like it before it does take some time to get used to. make sure you shake it and apply only a dab- tapping it as you put it on- no rubbing. then i use a fan to dry it and the wrinkles automatically disappear! an absolutely incredible product at an incredible price. i used something previously that i purchased at a kiosk in an upscale mall that was similar to the consistency of this product- but paid.!!! i was desperate at the time! this is such a great find! i thank the girls at sephora for recommending this product to me! i am forever grateful.,positive

"tata harper resurfacing mask has a gel like consistency. it feels very refreshing when applying to the skin that i even think would make a very nice cool mask for the summer especially if you put it in the fridge. it has a very clean and fresh scent which i like since scents on the face just seem to stick longer. when you apply, it applies smooth and when it starts drying, it gets a bit harder. it is easy to wash off with just some water and leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth. i have oily skin and it still left my skin very soft and refreshed however, i did not see any improvements in brightness at all so i would not buy this based off that. i think it is just a nice cooling mask. as far as exfoliation, it gives you a cleaner feel but i do not think it removed any dead skin since it is very gentle and jelly like. i would probably used this as a refreshing and cooling mask after having gone through other treatments. i do love that this product is marked as clean beauty but i would most likely not purchase this in the future. this was gifted by tata harper skincare in exchange for my honest review.",positive

i enjoy this product. it is a creamy texture that turns white when you run into skin. i definitely notice y sin after and brighter after using this mask. i notice a glow after i use this product. definitely will continue to use this product regularly! i received this product complimentary for testing purposes,positive
my skin texture feels weird after using this product.,neutral
"i mix a drop with my moisturizer and my skin feels so hydrated afterwards. after letting it sit for a few weeks and not really knowing what to expect, it is now a must-have, and love the way my face looks when i wake up!",positive
not very moisturizing. maybe for younger skins?,neutral
"i bought this for my husband who has no skincare routine and totally anti fragrance, chemicals, etc. it is simple, light, and keeps him moisturizer. plus you really cannot beat the price. it is a win for me.",positive
i really wanted to like this product but just like others i have also had a problem with this product peeling with application. maybe i am rubbing to hard when applying? besides the peeling i do like this product. i feel like i am getting good coverage without my skin feeling oily.,neutral
"i received this from influenster, and at first i was really excited to be able to test this out! i have been using it for a couple of weeks, and within the first week, i noticed my skin looked brighter and had this glow. however, i also noticed my face had little tiny bumps that were not there before. i am not sure if i am reacting to any of the ingredients, but i typically do not get tiny bumps from my usual routine i have tested this with the essence and have tried the essence without using this, and the breakouts only happen when i use this. i want to love this, but i have a feeling it just will not work for my skin.",neutral
i really love this face mask! my skin feels so soft and hydrated after using it.,positive
this made my skin breakout so bad. i was really going to like this but i got disappointed! i think it is still a good product though because it feel so nice and hydrated on the skin but i was getting pimples everywhere on my face the next day! just not the best for my skin type,negative
i never post reviews but this mask is incredible! i have super oily skin so hydrating masks are iffy for me sometimes but this mask is amazing! i was having terrible breakouts and it has completely calmed my skin down. i wake up and my face feels so plump and hydrated without being greasy! highly recommend and will definitely repurchase!,positive
i used this product just three times...whenever i applied it on my face it gave me some tingle n num feeling on my tongue and the whole face. it make me feel nauseous and when i applied it at night time around.pm i had vomit in the morning and i felt sick. so i think this product does not suits me.,negative
"this started off amazing. i loved this product because i have red, sensitive skin. however, there is not much in the jar and after time the contents separates and leaves an oily substrate behind. i typically ended up blending it with a brush or my finger but this wastes product, which there is very little to begin with. since working during covid, i have not been wearing as much makeup since we were receiving limited ppe at my hospital. it does have a tint to it and it does easily rub off onto a mask. i would recommend this product if you do not mind spending the money on this sort of thing.",neutral
"i, i love this so much. i swear that if they come out with this same formula but fragrance free i would be in love for ever. but for now, i will continue on my searching of the perfect fragrance free, no white cast or sticky feeling mineral sunscreen. but yeah i love it.",positive
"i really wanted to love this product. it smells amazing and leaves your skin baby soft, but it is just not made for people with oily skin. i felt it left my skin to greasy looking ten minutes after applying. this would be better for people with dry skin.",neutral
"this was my first time trying, or ever hearing of dr. zenovia skincare before, so i honestly was not sure what to expect of the retinol eye recovery cream. i have tried a lot of eye creams before, so i am definitely no newbie to them. first of all, the packaging for this product is terrible! i do love that it is a pump container, and therefore cannot be contaminated, however, the product itself is much too thick for this packaging type and it simply does not dispense without much frustration and effort. i have already mentioned the creams thicker consistency, which is not my favorite for a cream, but it does apply nicely and feel refreshing on the skin. i did notice a slight brighter appearance in my under eye area after use and my skin felt hydrated. i do like that this cream is also unscented, so that is a big plus for those sensitive to fragrances. overall, this product was just ok for me and i would not say it would be a favorite by any means.",neutral
my most favorite product sold at sephora. i wipe my face- times a day and it prevents me from breaking out. love love.,positive
"it does a good job of removing makeup and keeping the moisture in my skin. the biggest downside is that my eyes get a foggy film after i clean it off. it almost looks like being in a steamy room and it lasts about a minute or two before my sight goes back to normal. i am not sure if anyone else has had this happen, but it freaked me out the first time it happened and it still continues to happen.",neutral
"i received this product complimentary for review. the product smells wonderful and is very hydrating. however, for the price i could not justify purchasing a rose smelling gel and cream. i feel that other products could do the same job. as much as i love this product there is so little of it in the jar.",neutral
"i tested out a ton of moisturizers in the store before settling on this one. i really like how it does not leave me feeling greasy or sticky. it just leaves a nice soft feeling. the fragrance is extremely strong which takes off one star. and also when i opened the package it was at least half empty. i felt so confused by this. the tester one in the store had more product than my supposedly brand new one. for dollars that was quite the disappointment. i am keeping it because it does work good, but wow. half empty. i have bought lancome products before and they were always filled to the top but this one was not. i am debating on whether i should exchange it for a different container but the effort almost does not feel worth it.",neutral
it is good and helps in reducing redness. it is quite good for my combination to dry skin.,positive
this did not work for me! no reduced redness and no change,negative
this product was beyond disappointing. it actually smelt like cigarette smoke,negative
"if you are into cucumber scented products than this would be the one for you. as a whole the product has a nice texture, applies smoothly and does not leave a noticeable residue. i apply it at night before facial cream. it definitely improves redness and irritation associated with acne however i cannot stand the fake cucumber smell it has. if you do not like cucumber scent i would not recommend this product thus why i have to give it stars. i received this product for free to test if i had purchased it i would have returned it.",neutral
i got this product free complimentary of influenster.first of the product excels itself. is very luxurious it is luxury in a box. the serum is a bit oily for my skin. i have oily skin around my t-zone i did feel like it was a bit heavy. i recommend this for people who have dry skin.,neutral
"fresh can do no wrong. i incorporated this into my routine which is typically rose toner, and their rose moisturizer. this just gives me added hydration, bounce and less sensitive skin. the bottle is gorgeous so luxe and heavy. i also use this at night after my kombucha treatment.",positive
my skin turned into an oily mess plus it did break me out!,negative
maybe my hyperpigmentation and skin texture worse.,negative
"just okay. i like the idea of tanning water application- it actually is not streaky on application which is nice. the color is not too orange. after a day or two, my arms and legs became very splotchy, even when i exfoliate hours before application and moisturize daily. it just did not look good after the initial application. also, it did not tan my chest or back? it only would tan my arms and legs?? so bizarre. wanted to love it because of price and the water idea. just not for me. not sure if i cannot return it at this point because it does take a good bit of water for a good application.",neutral
"i used this consistently for a whole bottle and a half, i did not change any of my other products at the time. i noticed my skin had increased sensitivity and redness. i was highly disappointed.",negative
"this product has been gifted by glow recipe, however, the review is my real and honest opinion.glow recipes watermelon glow biacinamide dew drops are a great addition to skinmake-up routine! i love using this serum at the end of my skincare routine to give me that natural glow. it has a holographic shine to it, not an dewyoily look, which is what i prefer. i have sensitive skin and this did not dry my skin or break me out! to note, it has a really sweet scent like candy. i liked it, but if you are sensitive to strong smells, you might not like this. overall, i liked this serum and will continue to use it daily!",positive
i had high expectations for this product. i have combination skin so this formula was way too greasy for me! unfortunately i will not be purchasing again.,negative
not worth it- so expensive and did nothing for me. it feels nice but that is it.,negative
this would be much better if it was watersweat resistant. it always ends up getting in my eyes and burning but if that did not happen the finish is amazing and the price is great. hope they make it water resistant in the future!,neutral
this used to be my hg until i bought a new bottle this year. somehow it is reacting to my sensitive skin. i used to be able to use this even when my moisture barrier was compromised it would almost calm my dryness. does not seem to work anymore though. i would still recommend this if it agrees with your skin!,neutral
"i would definitely recommend only using this at night. i can feel it working through my skin, however it does leave a film feeling on my skin afterwards and does not seem to want to soak in easily. i do notice a difference in my appearance. skin looks brighter after using and my face feels softer the next day.",neutral
"buy it. even if you are unsure--just buy it. you cannot beat the price and you are not going to be disappointed. i have super sensitive skin, but i introduced this into my routine no problem! i even use it on stubborn breakouts on my body because i have been getting those lately, and i have no idea why and it calms them right down. i actually find that this works way better than the typical spot treatments which say they will not over dry my skin but then they do. if you have the same problem, or even if you just have some minor texturebump issues, pleeeaaaase do yourself a favour. buy this.",positive
i received this product for free. i really notice a difference with my dark circles. product was very light it did not feel like i had anything on my eyes.,positive
"i still want so badly to like this, it sounds like the perfect sunscreen. i have only used it a few times, but it pills no matter how i try to apply it, whether whole face at once or in sections, and whether rubbing it in or lightly tapping. this morning it looked so bad that i washed my face and started over, using a different sunscreen as my last step. my morning routine cleanser, vitamin c serum, moisturizer, spf. maybe if sunscreen is all you apply in the morning, it will go on smoothly, but that is not me. i threw out the box already, otherwise i would return it.",negative
"i am torn between this product. there are pros and cons to my experience. i love that it made my pores look nonexistent. however, it did seem to cause breakouts. not all the time just sometimes. also, it left my face feeling tacky. i would not recommend just due to the price and the breakouts. keep in mind, i have dry sensitive skin. hope this helps. complimentary from innbeauty project",neutral
this is the first time i have used this product and i absolutely love it! my skin feels so soft and plump. it smells amazing too. i look so glowy after using this. i highly recommend this product if you have never tried it before!,positive
"firstly, loved the smell of this and found that it removed makeup and sunscreen well. packaging is nice. however, the texture is too solid and will not emulsify no matter how much you try to warm it up in your hands or rub into your face. chunks of it just fall into the sink and get wasted. product seems to be okay in the middle of the jar but gets worse and worse near the sides and bottom of the jar. will not repurchase unless they change the formula.",neutral
"i was very impressed with my inkey list salicylic acid acne pore cleanser. it cleanses my face very well, it had hardly no scent, rinsed off easily, and left my skin feeling very soft and clean. really helped with my slight acne and i could tell it opened up my pores. my skin looks and feels great.",positive
"this is a super gentle exfoliator and smells delicious. it works pretty well if i had to change one thing i wish the exfoliating particles were a little rougher. it is advertised as a daily face wash though so that is understandable. overall, it works great.",positive
"smells like cucumbers without being overwhelming! super light but moisturizing at the same time! does not irritate my skin at all! i can usually tell when my skin likes a product and does not, right away. is kind of pricey and does not help with dark under circles, but is a good eye moisturizer. super important to moisturize under and around the eye for anti-aging!",positive
i tried this so many times but it dries my dry skin out even more! every time i use it my skin is stripped and flaky. it just did not work for me.,negative
"i really do not see the hype with this face. i am a skin care junkie and i pretty much have every face mask that sephora sells. i used this mask for a week and although it has a soothing feel, i did not get much else out of it. i have used her hyaluronic acid and i would buy that if it was not ridiculously expensive, so i know she must have other decent products, but this one is going back. do not waste your money unless you like being disappointed.",negative
"i really, really wanted to love this cream. i have very dry skin so i am always looking for something super moisturising, but when i used this i think it just was not enough or it came off during the night? no clue. it does not have a smell though which is a plus and feels really great at first application, it just might not be enough for people with extremely dry skin like me.",neutral
"it feels silky and smooth and really nice if you have oily skin, i would say. for me, it is far from enough moisture and leaves my skin to start drying out after maybe minutes. but it is a great moisturizer if you do not have dry skin.",neutral
my skin did not like the fragrance in this product. from a hydration point i could have bought the inkey lists serum and have the same results. the consistency is great- but the results did not justify the price for me.,negative
"i love this so much. it made my skin glow within the first use, and saw nothing but improvement from there. even though i have oily acne prone, sensitive skin, this really does not break me out and reduces fine lines and dullness. i definitely recommend.",positive
"this stuff is terrible. i will probably use it on my arms and for the beach but, will never buy again. it is way too greasy and the glow is not a glow. it just sits on your skin. none of supergoops products are that great. this is too hard to work with for on the face. hard pass!",negative
"coming from a low maintenance facemakeup regimen that needs to be quick and on the go mom of and right now i want to love this product like many do but it did irritate my skin- spots of redness, slight tenderness.",neutral
"this literally melts the dirt away, i love it. it leaves my skin feeling well moisturized, now i want one for my body!",positive
"breakouts next day i dint pay for it, it was a small sample ml size, wound not but it. hope it works for someone else",neutral
"i have definitely noticed big changes in my skin, especially when using consistently x per week. i have worry lines between my eyebrows and these pretty much disappear when using this. it also really helps with my forehead and smile lines. i have also noticed improvement in my skin texture.",positive
"i did not get the burning that some other users are describing, but the cream did blur my vision every time i tried it. it also pilledflaked. it has a nice creamy texture, but the irritation made it not worth continuing use.",negative
i rarely leave reviews. i do not like the menthol smell but i will admit that this really hydrates my skin for the whole day. i would buy it again and use it as an overnight mask.,neutral
not fan of the smell. leaves my face with a heavy feeling like an odd greasiness when it dries. the only thing that i did like was the cool sensation when i applied it and it did remove dirt. but cannot deal with the smell and the heavy oily sticky feeling after it dries.,negative
i received this product complimentary from laneige.this cleanser is amazing!! i use it once in the morning once at night.i can noticed a difference in how soft my skin is!! i would definitely recommend!! this product is now part of my daily routine.,positive
"i had high hopes for this since it was the top seller after i had filtered down to what i was looking for. i do love that it is clearly an environmentally friendly company, but unfortunately that is where the positives end for me. i do not like the consistency of this product. it is very difficult to apply and seems like you waste a lot trying to get it on your skin even following the directions of warming with your fingertips. on top of that, i have seen no visible improvement in my skin tone or moisture levels since using this. i will definitely be returning this one.",negative
"i am obsessed!! i keep this pen in my purse and use it after drinking coffee or tea, or on the way to an event. i truly do see a difference with each use.",positive
"i had high hopes for this product, but there were no results. i was struggling with acne in the fall, after months i saw no results, and now i stopped using this and switched to dr. dennis gross alpha beta pore perfecting cleansing gel with a simple moisturizer. i love dr. dennis much better. you.f.o. also turned my pillows green because of the chlorophyll. i was at first impressed with the ingredients, but i would skip. def not worth the price.",neutral
"did a decent job at removing my makeup, but i hated that it left a residue seemed impossible to get off after using. i used it as the first part of a double cleanse and that worked just fine, but i wish i did not have to use a second product after it to feel clean.",neutral
"i like this mask. i mainly use it as a daily moisturizer or as an overnight mask. it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day and night. after i apply, i notice a subtle glow to my skin. love the packaging and the texture of the product. i am giving it stars because i do not think it is revolutionary but it is a good product.",positive
"i have acne prone, oily, and sensitive skin and this just made me breakout more. it has a really strong smell of sunscreen. i am sure it is a great product it just did not work for my skin",neutral
this did not work for me at all. i suffer from blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin. clean and clear salicylic acid spot treatment works better than this. i even noticed random black heads throughout my face after using this which i have never experienced before. do not recommend.,negative
it hydrates my skin very well and allows moisture retention.,neutral
i received this product for free from influenster to try. it is felt great going on my skin but caused me to break out.,neutral
"i love the consistency of the product and that it did not make my skin greasy at all. i think it made my skin look kind of washed out. on the plus side, i did really like the packaging. overall, i would recommend it.",neutral
"i have a rule which i broke to try this product, that is do not buy anything where you cannot see the contents. sure enough i got only days use of this product which i paid.!!! this is absurd and shameful.",negative
sadly my skin broke out a lot from using this. i heard so many good things about it. my skin is not super sensitive to begin with. i also tried mixing it to dilute it but still was not for me..,negative
"look, this is far from the best cleansing balm i have tried. it works, but it does not work as well as some of the other popular ones out there. but in terms of bang for buck you cannot go wrong. this is a large tub for a really good price. it does not dry out my skin or irritate it. i use it as a first step at night in my cleansing routine and use a regular cleanser after, so i never use it on it is own or experience residue. so, it is fine. will i repurchase this? i do not know. i fee like the tub i have will last for a year and i have quite a few samples and point perks of different better balms so my instinct is to say no, but i will use the entire thing up, no problem. i think it is a decent choice for people who are price conscious.",neutral
the colour was lovely but it made me breakout all along my jaw line and my tan seemed to wash off at the end of the day.,negative
i saw really little difference in my skin after using the complete system for a week or so.,neutral
"mine has a really ugly black speck inclusion on it, but i chose not to return it since my first order with this product was stolen or never delivered and i did not want to go through the hassle of ordering it again and potentially having it stolennot delivered again. i like the product for cooling. i would not say you have to buy it, though. anything that is cold will work.",neutral
this product caused me to breakout all over my face! i really wanted to like it but it seemed to clog my pores. this may be better for those with dry skinskin that is not sensitive.,negative
"i combination skin and suffer from acne, not severe, but i do have several breakouts a month. i was nervous to try out something new, but if i do not use a moisturizer, i do notice a huge difference. i have been pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer! not only does my skin feel great after a tiny dab, but my breakouts have been minimal! this is literally the only thing i have changed in my routine! definitely a huge fan!!",positive
i have been using the water bank moisture cream for a while now and it changed my skincare routine. it left my otherwise very dry to combo skin feeling amazing. i was nervous about the change to this item since sephora no longer carries the full size version anymore. i read online this is even better but i disagree. it does not feel as rich or does not let my skin feel as soft or hydrated. after using it for a few weeks i ordered the original version from the company website. it is not awful but not as good as the original.,neutral
"!!! i am a big fan of the brand so i was very excited to try out this product. i find that the deep cleanse can be too harsh for my skin with daily use, and this solves that problem! this cleanser worked up into a very light lather with soft exfoliating particles. you get all the benefits of tatchas signature ingredients which is a huge plus. it left my skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated as opposed to tight and dry. plus, i love the scent! great for someone who wants a deep clean and smooth skin without dryness and irritation.",positive
i really wanted to love this because i enjoy so many first aid beauty products but this unfortunately was not thick enough i bought this for the winter although i have oily skin i like to make sure my skin is very moisturized. it felt like my skin just ate it up and did not hydrate. i wish it was more moisturizing,neutral
"i received this to review. i did not really notice much of difference. i have never been huge on serums so maybe i am just not really noticing, even if it is making a difference. if serums are your thing, then i would recommend this one. some serums have strong smells or leave my skin feeling weird, but this one was pleasant enough in those categories.",neutral
"first when it came in the box it was leaking even though their was a seal on it so i really do not know what that liquid was. the consistency was very liquidy like water but then after some time it solidified into a milky thicker consistency. when i applied it on my face, it was very sticky and dried down that way. it also has a strong pen ink smell even though all these reviews say its odorless i do not know what to think but i am very disappointed. if anyone can leave a review in reply about whether this is supposed to be happening or if you experienced the same thing, i would be extremely grateful.",negative
"this works so well for me. i use an entire pump on dry skin and massage it in for- minutes to make sure it gets all the dry skin and oil plugs out. i then wet my hands and continue massaging it in and it emulsifies. it rinses well and does not leave a film on my eyes. removes my sunscreen and makeup very well and leaves my skin soft and clean. i just wish it was not so expensive.for reference, i have the most sensitive, irritable combination skin with hormonal acne, blackheads and redness. a lot of products from sephora do not work for me but this one does so i always repurchase.",positive
"the reviews are right, it is more of a metallic glow then i guess a sheer glow. it is super intimidating at first application but it seems to seep in a little bit better after a little while. it does not leave a white cast but it has a very subtle burn to the eyes i am going to nothing to make you tear up i would not buy it again only because i like the other one from the same brand better",neutral
i absolutely love this moisturizer it is perfect for my oily and acne prone skin. it is the perfect texture and does not leave me feeling greasy. will always repurchase!,positive
"i had been wanting to try this mask for awhile and was excited to receive a sample in my last order. i washed my face as usual before bed and applied the mask. it smelled a bit strange going on, but nothing offensive. however, as it dried, i kept catching whiffs of something almost cigarette-like. l finally discovered that it was coming from my face! it smelled like the inside of a house that has been regularly smoked in over a long period of time. so gross. i noticed that another reviewer described a similar smell, so i am glad i am not alone. anyway, i can forgive an odor if a product yields amazing results, but in addition to the stench, this did absolutely nothing for my skin.",negative
i am so sorry but this is not for me. i am using this with the dewy serum and my face has break out badly. it feels like i spread a kind of moisturizing cream which has glitter in it. just shimmery effect and nothing else. i went back to my favorite products and the pimples are gone just after two days. maybe this is will work on someone else.,negative
"i love the affordability this brand offers, so i have tried nearly every product. it is hard to tell what works when you are using several products on rotation, but i think this oil has improved some dry spots on my face and improved the texture overall, more visibly than other products. i would give it a shot if dryness and irritated skin is your concern.",positive
"i love this moisturizer it is wonderful with every skin type and it makes your skin so soft, i get really dried skin and this moisturizer can get rid of it in one day and my skin feels so soft and looks good and glowing",positive
"these complexion correction pads are wonderful! i have dry skin so i am always a bit nervous that any sort of acne treatment will completely dry me out and crack my skin but i have not had a single issue with these pads. you can tell they work super well by what they pull off your skin. i will use a make-up remover wipe, wash my face, and then use one of these pads and it still pulls dirt off my face. a-maz-ing! i will say, to me they have a very strong alcohol sent and when i first started using them on my face my eyes would water not hurt just water. i have been using them for a about months now mostly once at night, every other day and my eyes are much more used to them and my skin is wildly more clear. probably important to note that i use this brands acne gel and spot corrector.- if you are not ready to commit to a whole pack of these you can get the ptr acne kit for like. it has a decent sized pack. that is actually how i found them. i am going to be purchasing some for my teen brother too!",positive
"i definitely think this moisturizer is good but not great. it feels weightless on the skin and is very hydrating. although for me, it does not absorb into the skin immediately and almost just sits on the surface.",positive
"holy cow this stuff is amazing. i gave super oily acne probe skin. i do super bad things to it like overexfoliate. this makes my skin feel super firm, plump and deep with moisturized but not oily or even dewy at all. think of a plump grape or tomato. my skin also did not over produce oily for like hlf the day and my skin becomes oily after min. ridic!",positive
i am so sad to be writing this review.. i had such high hopes for this cream but it made my skin dryer than the sahara.. made me break out like crazy and gave me redness an uneven texture..,negative
"i received this as a free sample and this stuff stinks! way too much perfume and this just gave me a headache. i would never spend dollars for this, and my regular cleanser is half the price and is also perfume free.",negative
it works wonders but give it time. you may not see effect after first couple of days but you will definitely notice a huge difference if you give it a week or so. cannot wait to buy a full version!,positive
"i think these star reviews are fooled by the price and the parfum, which does smell amazing. if you are ok with putting perfume on your face, there is one issue already. and, if you perceive any skincare benefits from this product, it is placebo, or something else you are using. this cream is literally made from vaseline, baby oil and candle wax. petroleum, mineral oil and two, yes, two, types of wax, including paraffin. terrifying that people fall for this snake oil. if you knew what kind of garbage you were paying for, well, i would hope you would stop. thank god i got a sample, and researched it before spending any money.. these ingredients might have been efficacious in, but not anymore guys.",negative
"it is more like a cheesy shower spa treatment to me there is more scent in the product that would make you feel like it is doing a lot for your skin but it is just a basic scrub not a big deal and not enough for the price, i prefer dr brandt sorry!",negative
"best facial lotion ever. my face is a lot less red and irritated. plus, this is a thick lotion, so it is an awesome face primer for my light foundation. it seems like it is really pricey, however, it lasts me like months and basically does jobs at once. give it a try!",positive
"i really wanted to like this mask, but it just sat on top of my skin and did nothing for it. i tried it overnight. since i have oily skin, i also tried to wash it off after minutes, but it still only felt greasy and there was no absorption of hydration. my quest to find a deeply hydrating mask continues.",negative
"this product was a big meh for me and was not worth the price. i do not really notice any differences after using an entire bottle to be fair i do use quite a few products already. i will not be repurchasing because i did not find it overly moisturizing, and i need more moisture in my life during the fallwinter.",neutral
this product gave me the worst cystic acne all over my chin. i maybe get one of these type pimples on my cheek once in a blue moon. i currently have not one but seven of them on my chin from this product. absolutely will not be purchasing again.,negative
"moisturizing but not heavy, easily and quickly absorbed.",positive
"i love this product! i use it about twice a month. when i start to notice a lot of texture on my face or my face looks dull and pores look large, i use this product. i am not kidding, the next couple days after applying, my makeup looks incredible! makes my skin look like a canvas. i suffer from deep hormonal acne, i have not necessarily noticed a difference in my acne while using this product, hence the stars. i originally bought this product hoping it would help with acne, and if you are anything like me, i usually do not buy skin scare if it does not help with acne. but i will definitely be repurchasing this product until something better comes along. i have been using this product for almost a year now",positive
"the biggest disappointment with this product is that the bottle leaks everywhere. i have lost most of the cleanser to a constant drip out of the pump and onto the counter. i am not sure what causes this to happen-- maybe a combination of light and humidity? but this is an expensive product to waste. the product itself does not seem like anything special-- the fragrance is light and the cleanser does not do anything for my skin. if anything, my skin never quite feels clean after using it. i wish i had returned this as soon as i noticed the leak. needless to say, i will not be buying it again",negative
"i literally used this once- i put it on in the morning and when i washed my face in the evening my skin felt noticeably tighter already! and super smooth. i put two pumps by mistake and my forehead looked a little purplish on the edges so do not use too much. if it keeps my skin tight though i do not care, i will be purple. put some makeup on over it and you will be fine. i am definitely impressed, look forward to using it some more!",positive

"i enjoy the ilia brand. i appreciate this product as part of my prep before my heavier makeup. it is more skincare than anything and it has no coverage. i believe the pigment in this helps prevent the white cast that a majority of sunscreens give. i have no issues with breakouts and as long as you follow the instructions then there is not issues with it pilling. i have worn it on its own, under foundation, and reapplied it throughout the day with minimal issues. just be aware of the ingredients of your other skin products.",positive
it goes on sheer and clear but feels sticky. i applied a fingertip amount of product which might be insufficient for sun protection. i think any more product will be stick and tacky. i have combination skin and i wore the sunscreen over a matte moisturizer.,positive
"i have tried a few of these products from youth to the people and never have been thrilled with them considering the price point. went on to try this eye cream and will give the fact you do not need much and it spreads, however i do not know if it is because my under eyes are super sensitive, but it had a minor burn sensation once i put it on. my eyes look more red the next morning and it is definitely not hydrating, almost feels like the product might just be sitting on my skin surface. did not work for me.",negative
"good product for what it is, did not irritate my skin, goes on like a water-based serum and absorbs well. does not have any beneficial ingredients outside of the bha and green tea, so just a straight exfoliating toner. no bad for skin ingredients, though. underwhelming for me, i want a stronger exfoliator with more ingredient benefits. just think there are better options for the price.",neutral

"i have been using this for a few months now purchased it as a part of the black tea sample kit which was well worth the money. i have noticed that my skin feels firmer, but unfortunately this cream was not hydrating for my super dry skin- i found myself layering other moisturizers over it. not sure yet if i would repurchase since it is very expensive and you go through it very fast.",neutral
definitely buy this again it is gentle and not dry on my skin i feel fresh and my skin feels smooth since i started to use this i want to recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin,positive

"i used this- times a week to was my face at night and love it. the smell, texture, how smooth but not stripped my skin feels afterwards. i was feeling like oprah and buying friends my favorite things and this made the cut for extra special friends. a couple have told me that this quickly became their fave face wash. a little goes a long way too.",positive
"i like the texture of the granules in the wash, they do not feel very rough. on the other hand i hate the strawberry smell, it smells off, that is the best way i can put it. it also leaves behind a weird filmy feel. ended up finishing the bottle with using it on my body instead. would not repurchase.",negative
this has a strong and unpleasant smell. which off the bat is a deal breaker for me unless it performs miracles. i have good skin to begin with right now and did not notice any difference when using this. no extra glow or hydration than i get when using my serums from the ordinary. not worth the money in my opinion.,negative

"note received this product for free from influencer, and my thoughts and feelings on this product are completely my own.this product is okay, not anything to really race about. it did slightly exfoliate my skin, but the scent is really powerful and overwhelming.",neutral
this is a very cool concept but only lasts a few hours after use. i used these as directed for a month and saw no difference in my fine lines. the only difference was for a few hours after removing but then a few hours later they would come back. not worth it i think unfortunately.,neutral

"this product is great for its job. it takes off makeup easily without any excessive rubbing or irritation. the only draw back i had was that every time i use it all over my face i always breakout. i get super red under the skin pimples every single time, and i finally realize it is because the product leaves residue that clogs my pores. i double cleanse and it still manages to clog my pores. i will continue to use the product since it is a little too late to return but i will most likely only use it to take off mascara and not on my face.",neutral
really wanted to love this because i have rosacea and i saw it worked for other ladies. well it only made my face more dry and flakey even layered with a moisturizer so i was not happy about that sigh,negative
i have never been sensitive to any product but that product made me breakout so much! it also does spread on the skin very well... i know its just the product not the company though,negative
"i got this in a subscription box and tried it for the first time a couple days ago. i noticed a reaction shortly after putting it on my face. i was very gentle and rinsed it off after one minute at most. i must be super sensitive to an ingredient in this because yesterday my face felt dry and sore, like i had a sunburn. this morning i woke up and my face is swollen and super tender. i am yrs old and have never had any kind of reaction to a skincare product. this is a one star for me but there is a lot of great reviews on it so maybe if you have seinsitive skin, do a little patch test first to be sure. i have used other products from dr. brandt and have always been pleased but this one just does not work for me.",negative

"i have to say i am a tad disappointed in this product. i was really looking forward to using it since i love the farmacy brand, however the results were not up to par with expectations. i always test out a product for at least two weeks before making an assumption for those who are wondering. i will start with the positive aspect and say that this is an awesome makeup remover. super gentle with a nice fresh, but not overpowering smell, that easily loosens up all makeup even that stubborn mascara. however, when i would try and get my eye makeup off, it left my vision a bit blurry afterwards and made my eyes a bit irritated. not horrible but not pleasant either. the other huge piece that i was missing was the cleanser part. now i think if you are a bit older in years and just need something that helps hydrate and is gentle on your skin, then this product would be perfect for you i gave this to my mom who is and it is been wonderful for her. i would say for those who still struggle with acne or face oil, this is not the one for you. after two weeks of washing with it, i noticed my acne coming back that i had long since gotten rid of. what i started doing was just purely using it as a makeup remover but then doing a co wash, which seemed to produce better results. so would i recommend this product? i will give a tentative yes if you are aware of your skin needs and use another cleanser as well. it is a beautiful product that has awesome ingredients and a lovely smell so it is a win lose in my book.",neutral
"- the smell is very gentle and pleasing.- it did make my skin appear smoother and add a glow.- it did not minimize the appearance of my pores as much as i expected. generally my pores do not show a lot, but lately, it looks a bit more noticeable than usual. since using the honeymoon glow serum it has reduced the appearance a little bit. on a scale from one to ten, with ten being how effective i found it to be, i would rate it a five on minimizing pores.- it worked well with my other products, i used origins face wash and i did not experience any irritation.- the consistency is perfect! it is not too thick or runny it feels really lightweight when you put it on.- i have combination skin and i tend to get oily in the summer. with that being said, i do not think the serum is too oily. it will work for all skin types.the glow is poppin! i do see a different radiance on my skin and would be perfect to use if you are rocking a fresh face.",positive
this cream is not for sensitive skin. i used it for a week and my face is still suffering the consequences a month later. dry patchy flakes are what i experienced.,negative
"i would not say it is incredibly moisturizing, more like a gel moisturizer. as for the healing properties in respect to acnepimplesredness i would not say it does not much of anything.",negative
this is wildly expensive for a face wash and far more than what i would normally spend but it really was one of the best face washes i have ever used. i always figured face wash was not a great investment because of how little time it actually spends on your face but i really felt like it made my skin better. i loved the sample i received and choose it every time a sample is available but i am only giving it stars and not purchasing full size because i absolutely hate the packaging. it is a nightmare to get product out. the second they change the bottle i will order a case!,neutral

at first i loved the way this product looked on my skin. i wore it when i ran outside and never had a problem. i wore it by itself when i was out in the sun for a few hours and even re applied it every two. i still got burnt. my face never burns that easy especially when i wear sun screen. not sure why this spf did not work but i would not recommend this spf to be worn as your sole sunscreen protection.,negative

"i have combooily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin so i was looking for something that was going to help with my redness that also contained spf. i purchased the mini size so i can test this product out for myself but unfortunately i found it to dry my skin after minutes of wear and needed to really rub this into the palms of my hands to minimize the pasty finish on my skin, and even in doing so it left my skin looking ghostly- i really wanted to love this because of all the great reviews but i will say that if you are contemplating between getting this, it might be worth purchasing the mini size or going into a sephora store to test it out in person. skincare really is all about trial and error, so just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for you. i am just sharing my experience with this product. good luck to you!",negative

"my friend raved about this moisturizer so i thought i should give it a try. initially, i used it twice a day morning and night. by the middle of the first week i noticed my face was kind of flakey... so i cut it down to just once a day night and used another moisturizer for the day. within weeks i noticed my skin cleared up i am prone to zits in the cheek, chin and upper lip area plus i have zit scars on my cheeks. i was so shocked! my skin felt so smooth, firm and supple, but after a month with continued use i have been noticing that it is been making my skin flaky again... and i am breaking out again.... maybe i will try it again after the flaking goes away? i really want this moisturizer to work!!!!!!!",neutral
"this oil is definitely on the thicker side, i wanted to find a replacement for my argan oil. even though it is heavier, it is not as moisturizing as you would expect and it leaves a weird orange tint on the skin. because it is so cheap, i will probably just mix it for a body cream.",neutral
"this mask definitely reduced the appearance of my acne scars and left my face feeling soft and bright. i took away a star because it is messy to apply. the consistency is very goopy which does not pair well with a glass jar, it gets all over the place and you waste product.",positive

"everything it says on the package is wrong. based on the packaging and directions, i anticipated a lotion or cream, similar to the tanluxe gradual lotion, that would gradually develop colour as you wore it without the need for showering. instead, this product is a very dark green liquid that requires a mitt to apply due to instant staining, that leaves instant fairly dark colouring at least for me, i am rather pale, and needs to be washed off after a few hours due to the smell. the product also contains a large amount of glitter. for this price i expect a way higher quality product. i will be returning this.",negative

"while i do really like this product so far, i feel a bit ripped off because it is basically a sample size. the packaging makes it seem like you are getting a lot more product and it is only fl. oz. a little does go a long way, but even so, this will last about two weeks of every day use. i should have paid more attention to the amount of product i was getting. i would recommend it if you can afford it, but i would like a little more product for the price.",neutral

"this product is decent but it does have a bit of an orange tint. it is very difficult to find a product to mix it with that will evenly distribute the tanner. it turns out very blotchy on me and was very irritating to my skin as well. blotchy, breakouts, and orange is not the glow i was looking for. i might just use this on my legs..",neutral
"i have friends that adore this moisturizer, but it dried me out! it did not irritate my skin, or because any break outs, just left my skin feeling tight and dry. i have combo skin that gets the occasional cystic acne around my jaw during my time of the month. was hoping to find a good moisturizer for the winter but this seems to do the opposite.",negative
"after applying my serumstreatments i used two pumps of the emulsion and began to gently massage into my skin. the first thing i noticed was how weightless this feels. while it feels weightless going on it packs a powerful punch to the skin. it absorbs fast, instantly hydrating and soothing my skin. over days of use my skin appeared more hydrated and more plump with a subtle glow. this is a great emulsion for daytime use, especially during the summer, and for those of us who live in hot climates half the year. i have combination skin so this is fine on it is own during the day for me and worked well under my spf and makeup. at night when used i did use a cream on top to seal it in for extra hydration when using my retinol. la mers the hydrating infused emulsion proved exactly why it is my goal to purchase a whole line of their products. i would absolutely recommend this to anyone with sensitive or combination skin.pros- lightweight- absorbs fast- soothes stressed skin- deeply hydrates- reduces redness in my cheekscons- price. but worth it!",positive

"i wanted to like this more than i did. first of all, the packaging and look of the serum is beautiful. definitely looks luxurious and it feels lovely on the skin. it has wonderful spreadability and makes the skin look glowy and hydrated after immediate application. i had high hopes that it would live up to its claims and honestly, if i did not have photographic evidence, i might have said it did...as it just feels so nice going on. here are my concerns, however. one, it has a ton of ingredients listed...so many that i do not think you are getting much potency except from the first or or so and those are very basic ingredients you can find in much cheaper skincare. two, a lot of the ingredients are of the crystal powder and gold variety, which makes for an expensive serum but i have doubts about their effectiveness on skincare. third, this is definitely a fragranced serum distinct rose scent so if you are not a fan of fragrance or rose, you will not enjoy this. lastly, and most importantly, i did not see any evidence of improvement after consistent use morning and night for one month. i know it might take even longer and so i will continue until i finish the bottle but the claim seems to indicate that people should see results in weeks or more. my pictures show my skin after about.- weeks of use full month. as you can see, there is little evidence of change.my final thoughts are there are better skin care products out there for as much or less. i would consider something else unless you have money to burn and enjoy the charlotte tilbury line. it is a nice feeling product, i just do not see evidence that it is worth spending that much money on.i received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. all thoughts and opinions are my own.",neutral

have not seen any change with daily application for two months.,negative
"i really like the caudalie gel cleanser. i have really dry skin and large pores. i have definitely noticed an overall improvement in my skin. blemishes are disappearing, pores are shrinking and the occasional hormonal acne is nonexistent. this cleanser does not dry me out or strip my skin. i love that i am able to use this cleanser without feeling my skin tighten up. after applying as instructed my skin feels cleaner and leaves a nice shine. the gel turns into a nice foam and lathers up really well. the scent is light and fresh. i am happy with this product and the end results. freeproduct",positive
this cream is not suitable for oily skin. i am easy to get blackheads on my tzone if i do not keep my routine right. when i used this cream i definitely see blackheads and whiteheads coming back quickly. i would not be purchasing this again.,neutral
"look jn to using their dewy cream which i love, which is not that much richer in texture but is more hydrating. after having gone through jars of this i can say it makes my acne scars and oily skin look rougher. i relied more on a hyaluronic acud serum than this to provide needed moisture for my skin.",neutral
i love this gifted by dermalogica exfoliating powder! it leaves my skin feeling so amazing and clean! i have never used a powder exfoliant but this has absolutely changed the game for my skincare!!,positive
i just started using this so i cannot say too much but i just came here to say they mad over dramatic about the smell comments. its not bad fr i smells good to me lol,neutral
"wow this is a great cleanser. will not lie, i was not the biggest fan at first. i have combo skin and when i used it in the summer it just did not do enough for my skin. it was a great first cleanse though. recently my skin has not been at it is best and has become quite dry. this cleanser is a savior now..... it leaves my face feeling clean but moisturized as well. it just smells a bit funky and the product tends to separate if not kept in cool temperature.",positive
"this toner is amazing! i love everything about it. it tones and exfoliates, leaving the skin smoother and softer. you cannot beat the price either. at first i used it days per week for weeks, then built up to every other day to build tolerance. be careful with combining it with retinol, as it can be very drying if not careful.",positive
i am absolutely obsessed with this product. it has changed my skin and since day i have have religiously used it every day. will rebuy for sure,positive
i was conflicted with this product. i have dry-combo skin so i wanted to try this out. honestly i just felt really oily afterwards.,negative
my skin is not that sensitive but after having this on my face for two minutes it started to sting and burn and my face turned bright red.,negative
this is a really nice oil on the skin but oh my god i hate the smell. it is so bad i find myself holding my breath when i put it on.,neutral
"this product was just ok in my opinion. i do really like that it is fragrance free and that it is not irritating to the eyes, but if you have dry eyes or tight feeling skin around your eyes it does nothing to hydrate. i actually much prefer the inky list coffee eye cream.",neutral
do not believe the hype. this moisturizer is very greasy and will make you break out.,negative
i have dry skin and i thought it would be a good fit but it always breaks me out. i will go through phases of using it because it is a full jar in my cabinet but this is the last time. i have new zits on my face after using for the past. weeks. to recover i am using cold pressed jojoba oil as a moisturizer that is simple and my skin has started to clear up. the gel one they make is much better but still prefer my origins moisturizer because it is cheaper and does not bother my skin.,negative
horrible because acne to my clear skin. and left uneven texture on my forehead. awful product!,negative
garbage. the worst and most expensive moisturizer i have ever tried. it did nothing.,negative
love this amazing product.. i had applied on to my dark elbows and underarms... it is a magic... i wish i had taken pics of before and after.. the dark spots are gone.. totally gone.. i can breathe now.. and wear sleeveless shirts.. wow.. thankyou thankyou thankyou olehenriksen... vitamin c actually worked... first time...,positive
"nice product, love the size, love the consistency, love the scent. although i am yet to see any drastic differencechange, i am confident that it will based on the ingredients and my consistency of course lol",positive
"love this cleansing balm! it feels so luxurious, and i actually prefer this one over the farmacy green clean one. a little bit definitely goes a long way if you use too much then it will feel like it leaves a film after washing it off. also my fave product from this brand! price is a bit steep but definitely repurchasing if available at the next sale.",positive
"have been using a sample size of this ml,. oz so th of the size of this product and it has lasted me months and there is still a little bit left! so a little definitely goes a long way and feels great when i put it in but i am not quite sure if it is doing anything and it is quite pricy...",neutral
"i find this cleanser to be very drying on my skin and i have combination skin which is generally quite oily at the end of the day. after using this, my face feels stripped and tight with all moisture lost. it does not seem to have any benefits for me but it smells nice!",negative
"new technology alert!! i have never seen tanning mist! i have been going to a tanning salon for year but since the big c happened that has been on hold. discovering isle of paradise changed the game for me, it makes everything so much whiter and i can do when whenever i want to. it keeps my skin hydrated and gives it a nice glow too. it does not smell like your average self tanner cream, slightly fresh aroma which is kind of nice!",positive
"farmacys new night mask has been my favorite step of my nighttime routine. swipe for dreamy texture. recently, my skin has been loving niacinamide. this sinks in so nicely at night and does not pill. i wake up with hydrated smooth skin the next morning. i will continue to use this and share more thoughts soon. i recommend this for my oily skin gals!gifted by farmacy beauty",positive
got this as a sample back in december and just got around to trying it. dried out my skin around my eyesapplication area. would not recommend. definitely not worth the price. i will stick with my medical grade eye cream which is cheaper anyway.,negative
great retinol that does not make me break out and helps improve my skin. very happy with it!,positive
i received this as a sample. i was excited to try this moisturizer as i have found the winter weather has been drying out my skin. i cut open the sample and squeezed out the product. it had a lovely silky feel so i applied it to my face. what a mistake! the smell from the product hit my poor nose and i actually wretched!! i have never smelled any beauty product quite like this. it reminded me of mildew and vomit. and so strong!! i washed my face and hands several times but the scent lingered. i cannot imagine spending money on this! especially. i cannot comment on the products ability to moisturize dry skin as i could not keep it on. tata harper should reformulate and improve the smell. i would be hesitant to try anything from this company for fear that all their products smell like this.,negative
gifted by the outset. i like this eye cream so far! it definitely has a visually brightening effect under the eyes. it also keeps my under eyes hydrated well. no irritation and my eyes are very sensitive usually.,positive
"i got a mini version of this spf in the sephora favorites hello! holy-grail greats bag of trial sizes and i absolutely love it! i am a dark skin black woman and every other spf purchase i have made either made me look and feel greasy or gray. this clear formula spf allows me to properly protect my skin, too, which is always a struggle for darker skin tones. this formula is awesome it goes on clear and does not feel or get greasy. it is absorbed into my skin, completely, and does not block the absorption of my moisturizer. i think it is also good for lighter women who simply do not want to look greasy from their spf. great product!",positive
this is a holy grail find for me. i noticed results after two uses. the pores beside my nose were significantly less noticeable. i love it and will be buying again and again.,positive
absolutely love this product. only been using for a week but can seriously already see a difference in puffy ness and dark circles.,positive
"i really like how thick and moisturizing this eye cream is, but i unfortunately have extremely sensitive under eye skin and this caused burning and tingling immediately. the feeling went away quickly and i will admit that my skin was very moisturized then next day. there are other eye creams perform the same without the burning, though, so i will not be purchasing again.",negative
"this toner changed my skin and my life, it reduces pores, my face is so smooth, leaves glowy looking skin and feels very light weight on skin",positive
it might be a great product but i could not get past the smell long enough to find out. the copper peptide is very obvious as it smelled like i put copper pennies on my face. i am not overly sensitive to scents but this was too much for me. paulas choice peptide booster was a better option for me.,neutral
"the way i love this cleanser...no words. it truly removes all of my makeup, it feels so lightweight, and leaves my skin feeling so soft. in combination with other products, it has really helped my skin out a ton, and it is very affordable. stars all the way.",positive
wanted to love this mask but it does not mesh with my sensitive skin. my face is currently very bright red and irritated. i love the pumpkin mask though!,negative
"i have been using their cream formula for years, no problems at all. i decided to give this stick formula a try, not sure why it goes on super shinygreasy. i do not have oily skin, i am normal to dry. i can literally use it as a highlighter with how shiny it is.",neutral
"loved the experience of using this, but i honestly did not see any of the effects promised. definitely would finish this, but only for the feeling rather than the benefits",neutral
these things are amazing!! i used them on the deepest wrinkle between my eyes and it took it almost completely away. amazing product is all i can say.,positive
this is a really nice gel moisturizer. i have normal to dry skin and find that this works best for the day time as i like something thicker for night time. absorbs in the skin fast and feels light weight. also looks good under makeup. has just a faint smell of plum that disappears quickly.,positive
does not work for me. will look for other one. but anyway it is better than nothing.,neutral
i have been using this a couple weeks and so far i am not in love. after i use this my under eye do t feel hydrated. going to give it more time perhaps i have not waited long enough,neutral
"well, it moisturizes a bit, but that is it! it has an awful chemical smell and i cannot figure out the hype and the high! i am glad i learned this from a deluxe trial size...",negative
"i got a sample at first i thought ok this is great...so i ended up purchasing the full size. after a couple uses i started to break out w whiteheads on my forehead, chin and upper lip. there is something in there that my skin does not agree with. as far as the lactic acid it is quite strong because it does burn, which is not bad. but once i stopped using this my skin started to clear up. then i decided to try it again just to see if that was indeed breaking me out and i did the next day. this is quite expensive and the bottle is super light. cannot tell how much is in the bottle.",negative
heads up that this product is tinted! two shades too light for my olive skin as well. it is also an unpleasant gooey texture and the formulation caused a burning sensation around my eyes and i do not have sensitive skin-- could not wipe it off fast enough.,negative
my first product from supergoop and it piles!! i love the glow too. so disappointed.,negative
"i was hoping this would work but it was way too light for me skin tone. it did leave some white cast as well. but if you have fairer skin tone, this should work well.",negative
"the product is great! i love the smell and it creates a great tan. however, my spray bottle only works sometimes. i ordered a new generic spray bottle to try to save the rest of the product. the bottle stopped spraying halfway through my last application and my tan looks terrible. not sure if it is just my bottle or an ongoing issue with others.",neutral
i could not wait to try the goop beauty overnight glow peels that were gifted to me by goop. i have sensitive skin and this does not damage or hurt my skin at all. it is so hard to find a product that does a peel and does not harm it. i love it. so far anything i have experienced by goop has been great. definitely give this stars.,positive
"does what it is supposed to but is oily. while the scent smells nice, it is overpowering.",neutral
"love love live it! my skin got so much healthier. i still get breakouts but it is stress related, overall i am happy with good genes, i will be continue purchasing it.",positive
"i give this stars. it is easy to apply and it does not have a creamy lotion feeling. it is clear and light almost like applying water to your face. it dries nice and leaves a smooth feeling. i can actually see that my face has a nicer look to it and is not a dull. i love it, you need to try it!",positive
"i do not write reviews, but i share some of my experiences with olehenriksen balancing force oil control toner, it only smooth my skin but opposite to its ingredient which include salicylic acid and ahas during my one month of using it, it causes severe acne on my face every day so i have stoped using the toner",neutral
"i received this product complimentary from farmacy beauty. okay, i think i found a perfect hydrating moisturizer that helps my dry spots. love the light scent to this face cream and how light it is to apply. my skin has not been retaining moisture well lately but this farmacy moisturizer has been a saving grace over the past week. totally recommend it!",positive
"the applicator is amazing and great to massage the eye area. however, it is too thin to be an effective eye cream to combat milia as claimed. if they changed the formula i would try again. i used it for a month everyday.",neutral
"i love all of the fresh products, especially they are rose products but this toner has a weird after smell that i cannot quit out my finger on. it does have a nice subtle rose smell which i love but the after smell is just so overbearing. i do not know if i got a bad batch or it is the bottle itself. probably my least favorite fresh product",neutral
"first of all i never write negative reviews but i had to share my bizarre experience with this product. i was so excited to use, but for someone who has never had blackheads ever, to within a week not only was my face extremely dry in the areas of use but i had blackheads covering my smile lines and other areas of use. i am not quite sure how or why this product would do this but when i stopped use the breakouts stopped",negative
"i apply this ever morning and evening as part of my skincare routine. i have had problems in the with dullness and dark spots from old acne, this product has greatly improved my facial skin! it also has such a nice feel after application along with a refreshing citrus smell. it always makes me feel fresh and clean!",positive
"i had seen this cleanser all over social media and decided to try it to see what the hype is about. i cannot believe no one has mentioned the smell that comes from this?! it smells horrible. the texture is like a super bouncy jelly. you only need pumps to get the job done. i gave this cleanser a few weeks but decided to stop using it and go with something else. i do not think it is necessarily doing anything for my skin, and the smell is too much for me.",neutral
it is good. it hydrates and has a nice light texture. i cannot understand why it is. there is nothing extraordinary happening to my face i am not sure why anyone would pay. there are plenty of other hyaluronic acid products on the market that cost much less.,negative
i am giving this five stars because i think it worked excellent on my face. i have a lot of sunspots and redness in my cheeks and it covered them right up. it is however pretty thick and i am not sure that i would wear it every day. it is a product i have for certain times and places. i will definitely buy it again.,positive
i like this serum! it is milky and smells nice. my skin has been looking smooth and pimples are staying away. the bottle feels very luxurious as well. overall very happy with this serum and i will continue to use it.,positive
i have to say the serum was ok. i honestly think it will be nice to use before the wonder cream but i did not see no results instantly and during the week i tried it out i did not notice much. this serum has also a wet texture when you apply it but it dries within minutes.,neutral
"this product did not impressed me at all. based on its price, i expected it to perform miracles. i am on my late s so i do not have a lot of fine lines. i did notice an improvement on the little ones i have. on the other hand, it does not work well with make up. it created lines under my eyes after h of wear. it does not diminish the look of my under eyes either.",neutral
not doing it for me. i have not noticed any difference using this product. i recommend their other eye cream it works much better and is very cooling.,negative
i received this small jar to try and review from influenster. i am so glad i did. this refreshes and repairs the aging eye area. it leaves the eye area feeling soft and moisturized. i highly recommend to anyone.,positive
"this makes the skin so soft! the supple skin it creates makes a great canvas for makeup application. did not irritate my eyes i wear contacts and the soft feeling last for hours. knocked two stars off, one for the high price point and another for not fulfilling all of its high promises.",neutral
i wanted to love this because it made putting sunscreen on super easy but everytime i used it a got a comment about how red my eyes were or were you just crying. so unfortunately i will have to stop using it.,negative
"i love this product, but the packaging is so wasteful and bulky! it left my skin very soft, i would have given it stars but the packaging and price lost one star each. clearly i am paying a big premium for the packaging, i would appreciate refills, especially from a clean beauty brand.",neutral
just started using this. i have dry acne skin so thought of trying it. so far it is good!,neutral
"i really wanted to like this product because of all of the great reviews, but it just is not right for me. i have very oily skin, and while it did very minimally reduce the amount of oil my skin produced, it still broke me out pretty bad during the first two and a half weeks i used it, and it just was not worth it in my case. still, your mileage may vary.",negative
"so far, so good. i have been using this product for a week now and i am really enjoying it. first thing, i really like the packaging. super cute. it has a nice scent to it that i do not find to be overpowering at all. this cream is very moisturizing under my eyes and feels very soothing. i have not had any issues with it.",positive
"enjoyed the texture. however an hour after applying, my cheeks felt so tight and dry. i expected more from this moisturizer",neutral
"i love this product! it is a certified clean product at sephora which is so important to me. great quality does not have to be expensive, which is amazing since i am a college student and cannot afford to spend a lot on skincare.",positive
"it is great for hydration, but i bought it because i heard caffeine is good for puffy eyes and this has all sorts of tea stuff so i really thought it would work but i have not really noticed a difference and it is almost gone. i am going to try green tea bags.",neutral
"i waited until i finished the bottle to write a review. i bought it with a recommendation. i used it daily on cleansed skin i have dry skin by the way. it did not really save my skin, it did not make it any worse. my skin is the same. not sure if i will buy it again. giving two stars because i cannot say i hated the product, i liked the after spraying feeling. every time i used the product it made me feel as i had flawless skin with no redness or anything...that feeling lasted until i stared in the mirror. small but is really convenient to carry around.",negative
"packaging design is horrible, a lot of product goes to waste as it is always oozing out as soon as i open it.using as directed daily so far for over weeks, no visible improvement. i will not buy again.",negative
"for my fair-skinned people, this is a no go. it does not blend past a lightish beige tone which was still a shades darker than my skin. i was definitely a bit disappointed. i ended up giving this away to someone whose skin tone is more suitable for this product, and they appear to like it hence the stars.",neutral
"i have tried many self tans and this one just was not it for me. it takes a long time to dry leaving you feeling tacky, it also does not smell very good. you have to use a ton of product to even get a little bit of color, so you use a bottle very quickly. definitely will be going back to some of my old tanning mousses. i would recommend the isle of paradise tanning drops though.",negative
powerful little bottle! this actually really works to smooth out my fine lines and wrinkles on my eyes and on my forehead. a little goes a long way but this absolutely works! i love it!!,positive
"this is a foaming cleanser from kora organics and it definitely left my skin feeling clean, but more like a squeaky clean that did not work for my dry skin. i do think this would be a good cleanser if you had very oily skin, for after a workout, in the summer etc but for me it was just too much in the morning.",negative
"i usually loveeee sunday riley products, however, this one was a miss for me, the amount of ingredients that i could not pronounce was concerning. i will discontinue the use. also i wish they switched over to more sustainable, compostable or biodegradable packaging.",negative
i want to love this cleanser but i have experienced more cystic acne after regular use.,neutral
"i loved this cleanser the time i was using, i was very sad to know my skin turned red when i used it. i would not recommend this product to people who have very sensitive skin. you are better off buying bioderma to control your oily skin.",negative
"skin type drynormal, easily inflamed, compromised skin barrieri was not disappointed in this product. it still amazes me that this delivers the same results as the de protini polypeptide. totally worth buying. i have tried other water creams that do not do a dang thing and were at least x the price of this.",positive
"there was nothing, absolutely nothing special about it!! waste of money you can get the exact same cream at the grocery stores for or dollars at most. then i ordered tatcha indigo cream from tatcha website and loving it so, so much!! i have dry skin and skinfix did not do anything for me. tatcha is a little more expensive, but worth every penny.",negative
"so i got this as part of the free birthday gift sephora gives out. the product is okay, it cleanses the skin nicely. my complaint is the taste! no i do not eat it, but if you get the smallest amount near your lips the taste is horrible! i have used many cleansers and i have never experienced this. i would not buy this product again because of that.",neutral
"i love all the good things this has in it, however for high, dry climates it just is not enough for my skin. i love my skin feeling refreshed, and this does not pack enough punch for it.",neutral
"i really want to love this. the cleanser from this brand is my hg and i swear by it. i love the ingredients of their products and the cleanliness of this brand. the moisturizer feels amazing when you put it on and it absorbs fast which i love as well, and your skin feels like baby skin immediately after! super smooth. but it just feels like it does not provide a good amount of moisture... my skin will get super dry during the day summer weather which indicates that the moisturizer does not provide long hours of moisture. again, i love everything behind the brand and there are a lot of pros to the moisturizer as well, but i do not want to have to keep applying it throughout the day or lather on large amounts. my skin is not that dry either hoping they re-formulate this moisturizer to provide better moisture.",neutral
"i do like the product and it gives a glow to my skin. i just do not like the separation of the spf and the pearl iridescent, and it can cause pilling on the skin.",neutral
"yes, this cream is very moisturizing, but only on the surface. there is a weird build-up or residue, everytime i touch my face or when i am blending in my makeup.",negative
"i received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. i tried this product before really knowing much about it. it works great! i have a teenager and a toddler, plus i suffer from insomnia, so i often have nights where i will maybe sleep a couple of hours at most. the first time i used bye bye under eye brightening cream, i was pleasantly surprised! i could not feel it a few minutes after it was applied but you also could not tell that i would been up since in the morning! the blue tint really does help disguise the circles under your eyes. it has a pleasant smell and does not feel greasy or caked on. i give it stars because of the price but otherwise this product is amazing!",positive
"first packaging is cute but i do not like the way they advertise it. it is not a mask you leave on your face while on a plane. additionally, and it claims that it can be worn as a primer but there are two issues with that. way too thick for a primer ingredients that it contains such as peppermint oil, orange peel oil, and corn mint oil can be irritating to the skin, which is why it should only be left on for minutes followed by a full rinse.it does leave your face looking hydrated with a glow, but i would say not my fav nor the best.",negative
total waste of money. it was like putting water on as it did nothing to improve my skin. i bought a different brand for less at a discount store that actually worked. do not waste your money on this!,negative
"i have a love-hate relationship with this product. it certainly performed well in controlling my sebum production as it claimed, to the point that i think my skin has changed from oily combination to more normal. however, with prolonged use, i found that this product has made my skin more dry especially in the cheeks area. the formulation is quite sticky and leaves an unflattering shine on my face, and it does not layer well will any other products. i hope to find a niacinamide product that is effective and also cosmetically elegant.",neutral
bought for the cooling metal tip but product is very thin and has no effects. separates easily in tube and does not create a barrier enough to protect from water loss and works better for like light light morning eye cream,negative
they are cooling and moisturizing but do not help with dark circles brightening or any other issues. lots of patches but after you open the container a few times they start drying up. i was not able to use more than half the container.,negative
"it is okay, it works really well but starts to smell like a dirty sponge after a month or so. too expensive for a makeup remover...",neutral
"i really wanted this to be great but it is just meh. i have used it twice a day for weeks and i cannot say my skin looks or feels any better than normal. not worse which is good i guess, but definitely not worth the price or repeat purchase. so sad because it is beautifully packaged and it is jlo sooooooo i wish i loved it.",neutral
"this was an okay retinol. i will say the texture of this retinol was perfect for my oily skin, but it really did not do more than smooth out my skins texture. it did nothing for my fine lines, pih, or anything else really.",neutral
"i love the ordinary, except for this product. it made my skin super itchy. only on the area where i put it on, like on my legs.",negative
"also like many others, very disappointing that they are no longer offering the old formula which i loved! i have never been able to go foundationless until i found the old cc cream. very disappointed its been reformulated",negative
it was too dark for me,negative
as we age we tend to look for different products to help with our beauty regiment. this secret sauce was new to me. i have been using it for about a month now and really do like it is the st few days it gave a little tingling after application that quickly went away. i do notice smoother skin and really enjoy using the product each night. the scent is not over powering. it is a thicker consistency that soaks into your pores easily. i would recommend this for others to try.,positive
made my marks darker!!! i do not like it. i fixed it thank shod. but this product sucks,negative
"i was really looking forward to using this product. seems pretty legit from the other reviews. it definitely stood out to me. unfortunately for me, i am extremely fair skinned and this turned my bright yellow. when i cleaned it off my face it was very yellow and there was a very definitive line where my skin started and the product ended. it smells great. looks great, comes in a cute jar but did not do it for me. do with this information what you will. i am an american citizen with very fair skin as my ancestors came from northern europe. hope this helps someone.",negative
"i received this complimentary product thanks to influenster! first off, i love the packaging! i always have my skin care serums in my mini fridge on my vanity, but i wanted to leave this one just sitting out because it is so pretty! it smells amazing, and it is not super sticky! my face felt plumper and healthier in the morning and i have seen a major difference in my glow! i would definitely purchase this again!",positive
"have not even tried the product yet and the packaging is already faulty from day and the lid will not close all the way. for a product at this price point, this is not acceptable. how do i store a product like this, that sits on its lid, if the lid will not even close...",negative
"i was incredibly disappointed how little product is provided for the price point. i will have to update my review later after being able to see results from using it, however right away i noticed there is so little product that i had difficulty getting it out of the tube. i truly hope that the results are worth the little amount of product sold.",negative
i like this cream because it is heavier. not greasy just heavier. feels wonderful on your face.,positive
i absolutely love josie maran and her products. purchased expensive designer brands for years and got horrible results. stumbled across this brand on qvc a couple years ago and my skin gets compliments several times a week. this serum is the bomb! be patient and you will get your results. i use several of josie maran products and my year old uses faithfully her argan oil. me and my daughters skin love her products! josies argan products are my skin only routine.,positive
it is very thick and heavy so if you feel like you need that then this is your product.,positive
"after weeks of using these i cannot tell if they actually do something or if my various lotions and creams are doing their job particularly well right now. my skin looks nice, but it is nothing miraculous enough to fully justify the price in my opinion. there are definitely cheaper options with the same main ingredients, but they do not taste as good and the last one i tried before hum upset my stomach a lot. so i will probably continue buying these off and on, just whenever i feel like i need a little extra help with my skin and have spare money to burn.",neutral
"i received this toner complimentary in exchange for an honest review. this product has a slight almond smell that i really enjoy. otherwise, for my combination skin i found this toner left an oily filmshine on my face. instead of feeling clean and refreshed, my face felt greasy. also the product separates, and you have to mix it up prior to use, which shows you really hope much water this product is.",neutral
"i received this in a trial size and used it religiously as my evening serum specifically for a couple weeks, with no other change to my skincare routine. a little goes a long way so while i would not personally pay the price for this i imagine that it would last a while. i have sensitive skin and while this did not burn or break me out like some products do, it did not exactly feel great either- it gave me an almost itchy feeling without an actual reaction. so while it certainly was not harsh by any means, if you are overly sensitive to products like i am it might not be a holy grail knockout like a lot of other people seem to have found.",neutral
great cleanser for combination skin! my skin feels refreshed and smooth after using it for five consecutive days.,positive
"let me start this review by saying that this product will probably work for you, i just happen to have awful luck and even worse skin.i am and have had persistent rosacea for around half my life now which is a lot earlier than most. my rosacea is in the form of constant redness all over my face rather than the more common occasional flare-ups or acne. its gotten to the point where i will not leave my house without a full face of makeup on to even walk my dogs or get groceries and i have gotten so so so tired of it. makeup used to be fun but now its just a tedious thing i need to do for an hour every single day. i was hoping this product would make it possible that i could leave my house without the routine for once. i do not need to look pretty, i just want to feel normal.although i have used products that tone it down a bit, i have never had anything completely calm the redness so after reading these amazing reviews i had such high hopes! worst case scenario it would not help redness but would be a good moisturizer. well unfortunately after using this product i woke up and the redness was actually a lot worse. i kept using it for a little bit over a week but it just stayed consistently redder than before and the texture of my skin also worsened. i stopped using the product for about weeks and then gave it another try once my skin recovered just in case and had the same results. i am not allergic to any of the ingredients so i do not know why it had such negative effects when it seemed to work perfectly fine for everyone else.if you try this product i hope it works for you like it did for other reviewers! and if not, thank god sephora has such a great return policy.",negative
"this serum was gifted to me by skinfix for testing and review purposes but all opinions are my own. i am attaching a before and after photo to show my results from using it for weeks daily using it once a day. some days i used it twice but being a new mom i often only had time to apply it once a day. i really liked that it absorbed really quickly without leaving any stickiness and i felt my skin was very plump after using. i am years old and after having my baby my skin has been super dry and i also look tired all the time. well i am tired, but i felt that using this together with the skin fix eye helped me look more rested despite still being exhausted. i definitely feel it helped with my skin dryness and from looking at myself in the mirror and also looking at the after photo i can see that some of my fine lines are smoother and my skin looks plumper and more moisturized.",positive
i love this product! it is amazing! i instantly saw a huge difference under my eyes! which was shocking because usally it takes more than one day of using also it is nothing too heavy either i love a light under eye cream that works perfectly and this is my newest fav!,positive
"i have normal-dry skin so i thought this would be the best product for me, but as i got more into skincare, i find that i do not need this stand alone ha serum because ha is in so many other products. this product was fine. i probably will not repurchase this product once i go through it.",neutral
"i really really wanted to like these. i read the reviews, thought about it and decided against it. but then i got a gc and thought, hey why not. i wish i did not. the reviews are correct, they are dry. oddly shaped. for the price, it just does not match up. i much prefer the inc ones.",negative
"this product is not bad. it does the job it is supposed to do fairly. i have used better, but it does a pretty decent job. the price seems great, but it really is not. i know this is the mini size, but i expect to get about uses out of this container. i would rather pay- for a cleanser that will last me several months. this does a pretty good job, it did not melt all of my mascara off. for the size, it is just not worth the money.",neutral
"this is a really good morning and night cream is you have dry or dehydrated skin. i have combo skin that tends to get dehydrated. it is the perfect nightly cream for me, but gets a little too oily for me most days. i do love that the packaging leaves the products sealed air tight and clean. the only thing is that it is hard to tell when it is close to empty. i wish there was an area where i could see what is left in the jar.",positive
"love this product. its hydrating, my skin feels soft, looks even toned. i use it as part of my daily skin care routine. i have noticed its helped reduce the t zone oilyness.",positive
love this product! it gives my skin a natural glowy look and gets rid of any redness! it is a go to when i have no make up days.,positive
"i love all alpyn products, and this serum is wonderful. my skin feels so good when i use this. combined with the moisture melt, it is the perfect combo for me. i also like that it gives a little glow.",positive
"i did not hate it, it was light weight and super wearable. however, i replaced my regular moisturizer with this one and it made me break out-",neutral
"not good, not bad. this seems like something you just use for fun instead of results. it did not break me out and it makes your skin a little softer but i would not repurchase.",negative
"it lasted a long time and smells nice but it would splotch into small dark dots and weird lines on my body, also would rub off my buttlegs if i sat down even an hour after applying. it would settle into my lines in my armpits,stomach and elbows and cling to dry spots. and yes i shave and exfoliate before i tan",negative
"not for pale skin. initially the colour is green, but shifts to an orange-beige upon application rubbing in. i was very shocked to see it was drastically darker than my skin colour, and should definitely have been warned that this is not good for pale skin. i am giving stars as the product smelled nice and natural, sat nicely on the skin not too oilygreasy and blended easily with no reaction from my sensitive skin. unfortunate that the colour was so intense.",negative
"i have been using it for a little over months. it is a nice lightweight oil. i sometimes apply a second layer before bed if my skin feels tight and have noticed that it does not offer really any hydration like it claims. i cannot wear it during the day, because i sweat, and it has clogged my pores. it is starting to cause my eyes to water constantly so i might return it altogether.",negative
i wanted to really like this product but it is too thick for my liking. my skin feels thick and greasy after going about my day. it is very hydrating but just does not work with my makeupskin.,neutral
"i noticed a softer appearance in my skin immediately immediately, however after about days of use and making no changes in my skincare, the results went away. since then i have used just so it is not wasted. i do experience with application of other products after applying this my skin tingles more than normal, but that is it. the packaging also broke on me after only weeks i realized after it broke the packaging is deceiving as the product is contained in a smaller container within the exterior packaging. i love tatcha so i am very disappointed this product has not changed anything after months of use, especially for such a steep price.",negative
"i have a combination skin, thought this would be too much on my skin but its not. i only feel it on for- min",neutral
"disappointed. the pictures show a creamlotion, but i got a balm?",negative
i would not use this product everyday. i have relatively normal skin and this soap driesssss out my face soooo bad to the point where it makes it feel bumpy. i have tried it with and without using moisturizer after and same thing which is a shame because the reviews have been so good.,negative
"i like the tube, i like the consistency. but why does it have small particles in the balm.i have very sensitive skin and any particle scrubbing against my cheeks is a no no. i wish it did not have particles!! if it did not i would have loved this cleanser.",negative
"my face is soft but red like i have a chemical burn. i followed the instructions exactly and do not have sensitive skin. while i will not be using it again, i cannot imagine that you could get more than- uses out of this tiny jar if you apply a thick layer as the packaging instructs.",negative
i received this product for free from influenster and olehenriksens in exchange for my honest review. i think this product is good but not great. i did not find it that effective and i honestly would not try it again. i might recommend it depending on who i was recommending it to but not to many. it is an okay product but i do not have much of a use for it myself.,neutral
this stuff is ok. it does smell really nice but it does not sink in like other moisturizers and it honestly feels really sticky.,neutral
love this for night time. i wake up and my skin is so soft and supple. i use it often in conjunction with other serums and it plays nice,positive
"i had really high hopes for this product reading the other reviews but i was thoroughly disappointed. after using this product, i broke out worse than i had before and i had to stop using the product. i tried to use it again and the same thing occurred. i have sensitive skin so i would recommend those who have sensitive skin to try another product. i really wish the product worked but i cannot recommend this product.",negative
"i am new to using retinol and this is a good product to start with! i have only used it once a week and plan to build my tolerance. be sure to use it at night so that you do not get exposed to the sun with the serum on. i did not experience any breakouts and i have sensitive skin. overall, it goes on very smoothly and has a hint of fruity smell to hide the strong chemical smells. this product was gifted by farmacy beauty but all opinions are my own.",positive
"this is a nice product that is good for the summer because it is not greasy, but also not super hydrating. i do not like how long it stays tacky about minutes for my skin. i always worried about staining my pillow case. also i found the smell a bit strong.",neutral
"i do think this product has helped improved my skin, but i am definitely looking to try something else. i have lost a lot of it because it just pours out of its container, it does not have a pleasant smell smells chemically and it feels sticky. i will say though, it was the first retinol so maybe this is how they all are. if so it is decent for the price.",neutral
"i wanted to love this after reading all the great reviews but i could not. i used this for about two months. it stripped my skin and made it feel so dry and look so dull. i have really oily skin so this was a big surprise. i have stopped using this and switched to another cleaner and my face looks so much better. it did not help my breakouts either, it seemed to make them worse.",negative
"this product has added fragrance, the smell is too overwhelming. using for a month and have not seen any results yet. for this price point, not worth the buy",negative
my skin was so dehydrated and nothing was helping. i got this as a recommendation and i could not be happier! my skin bounced back so fast. will continue to buy.,positive
"tentatively, i like this. when i use it at night in conjunction with my exfoliating serum, i wake up with soft, clear, smooth skin. no more redness. calmed breakouts. a real i woke up like this glow. however, i took off a star because i am not convinced it is doing anything revolutionary that i did not get from using other, more affordable oils. i took off a second star because of the price relative to the results, and the scent. i appreciate that it is supposed to be clean so there are not supposed to be artificial fragrances, but yuck. i will definitely continue to use this up, but i do not plan to repurchase it. if i can get the same results from oils half the price, why would not i go back to them?",neutral
"if you do not mind that silicone feel, this sunscreen would be totally fine. i personally do not like how the sunscreen feels on my face, and it burns every time it gets in my eyes if i am sweating. i know a little can go a long way because if you put too much, it can feel goopy, but overall, i was not satisfied with this product.",neutral
"this cleanser is amazing! it foams up so nicely and makes your skin feel so clean but not super tight. i have tried the first aid beauty pure skin cleanser and this one is even better. it is a bit strong smelling if you are sensitive to smells, but does not smell bad at all. recommend.",positive
"i first i thought my skin was purging, but after consistent use for over a month, i realized it was making my breakouts alot worse. i would not recommend this product.",negative
it does not get rid of black heads i have bad black heads on my noes and it does not work it just makes more of them.,neutral
"i love this product. its not drying at all and has a pleasant smell. i have only been using for weeks, but, so far, i like it!",positive
"i am really sad with this product, the packaging is almost useless, very little powder and i am never sure if i am getting enough product. i have not found a way to wash the brush and it is looking super dirty now. i regret a lot buying this spf",negative
"unfortunately i did not realize the texture of the product was tiny granules. i did not exactly do my research, but had i read the product information i would have realized it is meant to be this way.sits on the skin weird, does not exactly melt into your skin the way you would want a face product to do, the grains feel strange. on top of this, when adding a sunscreen on top, makes the product more dry than it was meant to be. will be returning.",negative
it was honestly just...fine. i would not go out to buy it but if i had it i would use it. i will say i like it better than the original hour one because it did not sit on top of the skin like the original does so my makeup sat better on top of it while the original formula had the tendency to pill up.it spreads better because the formula feels thinner.i do not really think did much for my skin though. because of the weather i have dry and flackery skin on certain parts of my face and i did not feel like it was that much more moisturizing than the original formula. i think this is suited for people with normal skin than dry skin.,neutral
cleanses skin. but the fragrance was so strong it made my eyes water for long time after washing my face. would not repurchase.,neutral
"i returned this product because in the month i used it regularly, i did not see any benefits at all. i gave it to my mom and she did not either. i have acne, and it did not get better, as well at my pores stayed just as visible. it is also heavily fragranced. i did like the texture though, it felt cooling and fresh.",negative
"i received a day sample of this product and noticed it gave my skii essence and lancome visionnaire serum a remarkable boost within a week of use. i have super sensitive skin and it has never made me break out. i am on my third bottle now and i love the extra hydration that this product gives my skin, which can be a difficult balance living in a state like texas. i love the smell and the way this product absorbs into my skin. it does well under too faced primed poreless primer with bareminerals makeup on top. overall i have noticed my skin appears smoother and more plump since i have added it to my morning beauty regimen.",positive
"i have very dry skin and i use this on top of vitamin c serum. it seems to mositurize the skin effectively and lasts for about- hours.i did experience some breakout on using it, but it went away quickly.",neutral
"ooooooomg, this is amazing!! i have never been a fan of toners in the past... they always left my skin feeling tight and dry. this was exactly the opposite. after just one use, my face felt incredibly smooth, soft and hydrated, and it is only improved from there. i have not seen any improvement in my pores yet, but i will definitely keep using this for the other benefits! this is amazing stuff.",positive
i received this sunscreen from influenster for my honest review. this sunscreen was effective and worked great for those days that my skin feels a little tight or dryer than other days. i would buy this sunscreen again. i love that wears great under foundation and love the spf.,positive
"love this. i sometimes mix it with sheer screen to cut the glow, but does give you a lovely, dewy look. it is tinted, but the color is so sheer. it leaves no neck line or schmitz in your hairline. it is not as heavy as the origins and clinique city block similar products i have recently tried. i am a fan!",positive
"this is a good cleanser for dry skin. it is gentle, it lathers well and my skin feels really clean after! i have noticed a reduction in breakouts which is great. i do not love that it is got fragrance in it, but it is a wash off product so i do not find it irritates my skin.",positive
"i loveddddd the original formula so i was excited about this, but it is not that good. the old formula hydrated and calmed my reactive skin, this does not compare. it feels like it is sitting top of my skin and i do not like the smell.",negative
"not really a fan, have tried other brands that i prefer. these stick on well, but did not seem to absorb anything from the acne spot.",neutral
"great at first. beautiful natural looking tan, but alas it fades oddly and patchy. especially in this heat, it fades really strange wherever you are the most sweaty around the armpit, under the chest, thighs which makes the tan look bad. tried layering over the top, does not help at all. so disappointed",neutral
"so i love olehenriksen products. i use their face wash and toner for oily skin--love it. i use the vitamin c serum daily. i love their exfoliater as well. when i saw this being offered in rewards, i was like, i must try! first night, i noticed nothing really. second night, my skin broke out completely. splotchy, little bumps around my chinmouth area. yes, i already have oily skin, but that is the only other new product i introduced into my skin care routine. i did read that this happened to other people in their reviews, but i figured in quarantine i would give it a shot. since i love the olehenriksen brand, i will just chalk it up to a big loss. i guess it ultimately depends on your skin type. do yourself a favor--get the sample with your points or just wait until you can try in stores. i would not purchase this unless you sample first, since you will not know how your skin will react.",negative
"this product works wonders for my skin. i have combo skin normal cheekschin, dry forehead, oily nose and this helps prevent pimples, calms red bumps, and helps reduce oiliness on my nose. if i happen to get a pimple while using this it is usually due to it being that time of the month and this helps it go away quickly by reducing redness and texture. i use this alongside the lactic acid and the b oil and have been loving this combination for evening out skin tone and preventing breakouts. only con is it is a bit sticky. i always use something on top so it is not a huge deal but that is why the stars.",positive
"i was expecting more because of the reviews and the price, but it did not live up. it stung my eyes really bad like other cheaper sunscreens which is why i wanted to splurge on a better one in the first place and it left my skin feeling a little bit itchy. it also makes my face look like an oil slick. i look wet. i mean it is called water drench moisturizer so i should have known right? i used my sisters korean sunscreen and i was amazed that there were no problems there. i did not know sunscreens could be so pain-free.",negative
this serum works!! i had hyper pigmentation and tried all of the more expensive serums with no significant results. i saw the reviews and real photos for the results for this product and gave it a shot and am so glad i did! i use it right after paulas choice aha and my skin is so smooth and clear now! the dark spots are faded considerably in less than a month. highly recommend!,positive
"i really wanted to like this. one of the salespeople told me it would help with my redness i have pretty intense redness, especially in my cheeks and nose so i was excited, but it feels so greasy and heavy on my skin. it is basically just concealer but worse.",negative
"tatcha rice wash leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated! i like the light scent and feel of the cream cleanser. it has a rich foam, and it feels very rich. i would recommend this face wash. i used normal to dry skin. i had no tightness of skin, and loved the way it made my skin feel for the rest of the daynight.",positive
this moisturizer is worth every penny. a single bottle lasted me month. i noticed a huge change in my dark spots. it is also not sticky absorbs pretty quickly.,positive
"really never noticed a big difference after using this tried it for two months it still feels nice on the skin, feels moisturizing lightweight if you do not like heavier eye creams not a bad choice for the price of the product but i definitely prefer other eye creams over this one.",neutral
"i am sure this works great, i love all ordinary products. but i cannot get over the smell, it smells like manure. the smells fades off later one but i cannot use this without feeling so dirty because of the smell.",negative
"i have sensitive, dry, and dehydrated skin. i really enjoy a calming, thick moisturizer. this does not do it for me. i put on three pumps after my serums and it just is not enough. i do not really enjoy the texture either. i will hold onto it and use in the spring and summer months when i do not need as much moisture. it does not seem to do anything extra for me than a clean, drugstore brand at half the price. if i splurge on a face cream i really want it to wow me. the only one i have found so far for my skin that i am head over heels for is de la la retro whipped cream.",neutral
awesome product! i could tell a difference right away! definitely would recommend!!,positive
great moisturizer for the face... but does not offer much. it is all packaging. just has a few pumps.,negative
"i wanted to like this one so much, but honestly, i have not seen any improvement, my eyes still look the same and i have been using this for almost a whole month. spare the waste of money and time and go for a different eye cream.",negative
i have dry skin with terrible sebaceous filaments around my nose and some clogged pore issues on my chin. i have tried a lot of different things and assumed they were just part of life. days of using this and i have not seen my skin this clear in years. so glad i tried!,positive
"this is my favorite night cream. i have very sensitive skin and break out easily, been using this for over a year now and the light-weight cream is wonderful on my skin. gotten many compliments about how great my skin looks.",positive
"i have normal skin but a little dry in winter so i wanted a gently cleaner. this removes makeup, except it burns on the eyes and leaves a thick tacky residue on the skin so you have to cleanse with a different product. it also smells like plastic.",negative
"i have acne-prone skin that tends to hyperpogment, so i was excited to try this brightening serum. although i cannot say that i have noticed a significant difference compared to less expensive antioxidant serums, the scent and texture of this are pleasant it has a light citrusy scent and gel-like consistency. it does not make me break out or make my face feel sticky, but it does not sit well under some of my other productsmakeup and pills with some. overall, it is a decent antioxidant serum, but i will probably be sticking to my previous brands.",positive
"i received this paulas choice c- super booster complimentary from in exchange for my honest review. i was so excited to try this product! i used it for days and honestly i am not all that impressed by the results. it leaves a very sticky texture to my face after use and has caused tiny red bump breakouts. i even used the bare minimum and just dabbed all of over my face instead of rubbing it in to try to avoid the breakouts. it has made my skin brighter, but i just cannot get past the sticky feeling and my face feeling so heavy after applying it to my skin. the package is cute and i love that it has a dropper for dispensing the product though. i am not ready to give up on this product though. hopefully the stickiness feeing will not be outweighed by my complexion getting brighter.",neutral
"so i usually use regular self tanner. and it works great. but i am a mom and with a toddler it gets hard to keep up because i am tired and not in the mood to full on sleep in sticky tanner all night after a long day lol. so this stuff was easy, just added it to moisturizer. it did leave a nice glow. but i would say only you will notice. others might notice a glow but i doubt anyone will notice it as a tan. so if you want your face to match your body, def try this. but if you want an actual tan try something else.",positive
this caudalie firming night cream with resveratrol lift is a decent cream but not my favorite product. i like its texture that was not too thick or too thin. i do think it was absorbed by my skin without feeling too greasy. it said it was for dry skin and normal skin. i have normal to combo skin. i usee this cream on neck mostly. this cream has a herbal scent. i am not a fan of the scent. a plus is that i did not get breakouts from this cream. i only got small samples for testing purposes. it is quite disappointing because i would like to test it longer for the skin benefits. my first impression is stars because i only got small samples to try freeproduct trywithtopbox,neutral
good cleanser but can be drying. nice foaming action and removes makeup well. would love to see them come out with a cleansing oil.,neutral
"i was really excited to try this because i usually love murad products, but this really irritated my skin. i normally do not have sensitive skin, so i was surprised i had such an adverse reaction. i only tried it separate times and my skin could not take anymore, so i had to take it back.",negative
"i received this products using my sephora points, i read the reviews and had high hopes for a it! as soon as i used it on my skin my face started feeling itchy and hot!! the serum also feels like it is tacky and just sits on top of the skin. i had to wash my face after minutes of having it on because it was so itchy. wasted my points for nothing! beware if you have sensitive skin not worth the price.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from tata harper to review and test. i absolutely loved the packaging and the citrus scent, but the apricot microspheres in the cleanser definitely make me pause to recommend this product wholeheartedly. the formula has bhas in it, so it did not need a physical exfoliant in it as well which can cause microtears in the skin if used too frequently. i love the cleanser, but will be using it on my hands and feet much more often than i will on my face, specifically because of the apricot microspheres in the formula. will definitely be reaching for this when i feel like there is a lot of buildup on my skin, but definitely will not be using this daily.",neutral
amazing product for anyone with rosacea- in the past i wear foundation every day for the sole purpose of canceling out the redness on my cheeks- i am super hopeful to be able to switch over to this product fully. as much as i love this product i did deduct one star as a larger shade range would be good. i am pale but even the porcelin shade is quite dark on me. hopefully this will be a good match for my summer skin tone.,positive
it did not do anything for me. i got a deluxe sample. i suggest go get a sample from the store. drunk elephant is better.,negative
"it is a great product. the only thing is that the smell gives me a headache and i am not particularly sensitive to strong smells. on the plus side, it is moisturizing and soothing. i do love that.",neutral
this is my favorite new product!!! i received this from influenster to try for free and i absolutely fell in love! i get a lot of hormonal acne and have tried everything there is to work on skin firmness and plumping my skin. wow i was actually in love with the packaging and how the actual product felt on my skin. it is so light and makes my skin feel so soft and radiant. my acne scars are depleting from the amino acids and i could not be happier. i feel like i am slowly achieving glass like skin with this and i will be sure to keep buying,positive
this is the first product i tried from sunday riley and i am impressed! i really love the texture of this product and its super hydrating for my eyes without taking forever to sink in. i use this-x a week so far to get my skin used to the retinol.,positive
very moisturizing! great scent. must use this product with wet face for better result. highly recommended,positive
"just finished my second bottle, each bottle lasted over a month with daily use in the am. packaging makes it hard to get all of the product, which kind of crazy with how expensive this is. it works on dark sports, but thanks to the tranexamic acid so you might as well buy a tranexamic acid serum and use another serum with l-ascorbic acid instead if you want to use vitamin c. there is just better options than this",neutral
"this spf worked very well with my skin. it was not sticky, did not leave my skin feeling oily and did not leave any white cast which is so hard to find, it also did not pill with other products. however, the smell is awful. i tried to push past it but it is hard to have a foul smelling product on your face.",neutral
"this product does sting sometimes painfully, i feel like i have to use a lot otherwise it does not spread. i started using it along with other products, so i cannot tell if it is actually working, but my skin looks great so its probably doing its job- i just cannot see a noticeable difference.",neutral
"i was excited to add this to my skincare routine but unfortunately it did not work well with my moisturizer. no matter how long i waited between steps, the two just did not mesh. it made my moisturizer drag and not apply smoothly at all. i consulted with a sephora staffer and they said it was likely because my moisturizer is oil free and all natural. for a couple of days i tried a different facial lotion and had no issues at all. this serum seems to work, but just be aware it does not mesh well with certain kinds of products.",neutral
"this is a good retinol serum. non-irritating i am used to retinols, inoffensive scent, not drying. i can see some improvement of fine lines after three weeks of fairly consistent use. will repurchase.",positive
not worth the hype. purchased this because of the positive reviews and was super unimpressed. ended up patchy and not very natural looking and did not last long.,negative
"as a guy using this, i can say it was good. it was great for me with a beard. i know some face washes are iffy for us, but this one is very good!",positive
"i am no stranger to double cleansing so i was really excited to try this, especially after my mom said it is one of her favorite products! it felt like it got the job done with removing my makeup. however, it really irritated my eyes and i am so careful with making sure i do not get my cleansers in there when removing my eye makeup. that alone is typically a dealbreaker for me, and i will say that i do not typically have sensitive eyes. i also was not a big fan of the smell. it was very strong and i felt it was unnecessary for the type of product it is. overall, i was disappointed and will not repurchase. gifted by dermalogica",negative
"i was able to try out summer fridays this jet lag face mask recently and it had such a creamy texture and so light on my skin, i could hardly tell i was wearing it. it did not make my face feel tight or dried out at all, my face felt amazing after each use.",positive
"my go to for makeup removal and first cleanse. its feels great on the skin, does not leave residue. it also did not sting or cloud eyes when removing.",positive
"i like for my moisturizer to already have spf and this does not. however, i did try using it under my usual moisturizer and it was okay. i noticed a fresh feeling almost tingling when applying, i am not sure if it was only me and my face. lol",neutral
"it is my first time hearing about this brand and trying anything from it. i am grateful for the opportunity i was given to receive this product complimentary for testing purposes, but as of this moment this product did not convince me. i have been using it for a little over a week now and i can say it is an interesting product. i love the packaging, i can tell it is good quality, even though for this price i would have preferred a pump. i am not usually very sensitive with smells, but this one has a strong herbal smell that it is been bothering me. as for the cream itself, i was expecting a lighter consistency that would easily absorb into my skin, but it was not the case, it had a thicker consistency that i had to massage it and massaged into my skin to absorb it faster. i am going to give it another shot, but for now on this is my honest opinion.",neutral
"it has a very weird scent i do not know if i got an old or bad product, also the texture is really weird it does not absorb it stays on top of skin, it just does not feel right.",negative
"i am so happy i found this product, this toner is sooo soothing and hydrating. it is my go to toner now.",positive
my skin is drier than the sahara. i need more moisture in my skin. i have been using this since may or june- it is now toward the end of july and i am still not impressed. i use this along with a moisturizer and an oil twice a day every single day and i still end up with dry patches throughout the day. i have changed moisturizers and changed oils while using this product and it is still not worth it.,negative
i really liked the way this product smelt and felt on my skin. it felt more moisturized and was easy to use. however after using it for a few days i started to break out. not sure if i will continue to use due to the breakouts. i received this product complimentary for review purposes.,neutral
"i have only been using this product for days but i am already seeing such a difference in my face! pores reduced, glowy radiance, and overall healthy looking skin. i did not experience the tingle feeling that is mentioned but my face did feel a little dewy when first applied.",positive
"i have sensitive skin and the minimal ingredients have caused no breakouts. i have been using this as a second step cleanser in conjunction with albalene. i love the way it leaves my face feeling. it is an amazing product and the price point is just great, i will warn you that you either love the scent of the product or not. i happen to love it.",positive
"just started using it. a bit sticky at first but my skin is smooooooth a few minutes after. i give it a try at day and night routine, niacinamide did not work well for me, gave me a few breakouts and now trying to fade my cystic acne scars on my jaw line. cannot wait for results!",neutral

"aweful. seemed nice at first but as soon as it dries mins and you touch your skin, it piles terribly. could never wear with a black shirt or under makeup. leaves balls of cream all over your pillow. it does not absorb at all.have literally tried all creams and have never returned a single in my life but i will be returning this.",negative
"i am really trying to give this a chance. i have been using it for a while now, but i do not see any improvement. i was sold by the advertisements geared towards all of my problems, but i am left disappointed.",neutral

i had high hopes with this because all the other iop products i have tried have been fabulous. but this was disappointing. i do not think it did anything other than moisturize.,negative
waaaay too glowy for my liking. it makes me look too shiny and not in a natural way,neutral
"after reading the great reviews i really had high hopes for this. i was looking for a serum to help with the fine lines i started seeing recently. i amin my upper s so the lines are very subtle right now. i have been using this product in combination with the ordinary buffet, daily, for at least weeks and i have not seen any results. zero improvement or change. i did not get any bad reaction and the price is great, but it is not worth it if there are no results.",negative
"i used the birthday gift sample of this product. i was trying multiple products at the same time and kept breaking out. i then eliminated them all and went through them one by one for a few weeks. from this i discovered it was the culprit of increaed closed comedones all over my face. i am bummed as i was excited to get a sample of such an expensive product. this will now be my neck and chest cream, which is a shame. back to using my hg cerave pm moisturizer.",negative
"the smell is what i dislike the most. i feel it does not do much for my skin, and i do not understand the price point.",neutral
"fantastic first cleanse to help remove makeup and especially mascara! it is definitely a first cleanse, though, in a double-cleanse routine. you will need to follow up with another cleanser to remove the residue, but that is to be expected in my experience with these products. it really removes everything and i feel like it prevents overs-tripping in the cleansing process. such a good makeup removing balm! this is my second purchase and so happy they have a travel size now!",positive
i wish i had gotten a before picture of my forehead and smile lines. this product has seriously reduced them. i am in my mid s but not yet ready to look my age! i have very young kids and try to looks as good as the young moms in the play groups. super happy this product works well and is not to pricey,positive

"after doing some research about vitamin c serums and reviewing the ingredients on this serum, i was excited when i finally ordered it. the ingredients caught my eye, as well as the price! i have loved some of the makeup i have gotten from this brand, so i had very high hopes for this product. the packaging is beautiful and looked like it would protect the unstable vitamin c inside. as was the case with many of the other reviews i have now read, when i finally received my online order, i found the serum was expired the vitamin c had oxidized and turned a dark brown color. i was soooooo disappointed, but i headed down to my local sephora store to try and exchange it for one that had not expired. the staff was great, but unfortunately after going through every single one of these they had in store, the very helpful staff found that all of their stock was expired! yikes... it does not bode well for this product. i ended up getting a refund and i picked up drunk elephants c-firma day serum. paid a lot more for this, but i know that the ingredients in this one are what i was looking for and it was not expired, so that is a plus! i gave tartes serum two stars because it has potential if you could get one that is not expired, although i would worry about its longevity- but the price is very good!",negative
i love this cream. no scent. luxurious feeling. it does not feel sticky or sit on the skin and absorbs quickly. i have even worn it under makeup this summer i have dry skin. little goes a long way and it will last you forever.,positive
i have purchased many of hums supplements. some are great! some are meh. but this!!?? this did the exact opposite of it is intended purpose. i actually craved pizza and other bad stuff way more than without. i do not know why. i hope you have better results. i would never buy this again.,negative
"this serum is amazing! first off it is safe for pregnancy, so i am glad i found this! it is super gentle and leaves my skin absolutely glowing the morning after. i have dark spots and i have seen them diminish over the past few weeks. this stuff is amazing and i highly recommend it!",positive
this is the only spit treatment that actually works. i already noticed a difference overnight! it also does not dry out your skin like some of them do.,positive
"i really enjoyed the texture of this sunscreen. its very easy to glide on and clear so easy to achieve adequate protection. however, like many others, this sunscreen irritated my skin making it feel itchy and broke me out. its not ideal, but i will keep the remaining to wear in water since its the best thing i found that is lightweight, waterproof, does not leave a cast, and is water resistant. def worth a try if your skin does not get irritated easily!",neutral
"cream goes on very smooth, dries very fast. reduced my my dark circles and puffiness.",positive
this is the worst cream i have ever used. it is so heavily fragranced and irritating i had to wash it off after minutes of use. why companies are still using fragrance in creams is beyond me. thankfully it was a sample so it went in the trash. sticking to my vanicream moisturizer.,negative
"this is a very, very good product, but you can get something almost as good for less than from the ordinary.",neutral
"not good for am! made my makeup pill up, hard to spread around and not the best.",neutral
"would have given this stars, except they changed the packaging and applicator between my purchases. when i first bought it, it was more expensive but i could just pour it onto a cotton pad and apply. now, when i purchased again sure it was less ml for a lower price but the pump applicator literally sprays all over my walls even when i hold a cotton pad on top!!! this applicator seems like a waste of money, more money on complicated packing when consumers want simple packaging. otherwise- would give stars for my skin.",neutral
"this product really stings and burns. i thought i got it in my eyes because of the stinging. i tried again a different day with the same result stinging eyes, burning feeling, watering eyes. i put it on my husband and he had the same reaction.",negative
"this is an amazing toner that really helped balance my skin. i was skeptical at first, but after a few uses, i realized that it definitely helps take care of the excess oil on my skin. depending on my day, i will put some on a cotton pad and dab it all over my face, focusing on my large pores. on the daily, i will use it before i go to sleep, right before my moisturizer. a must have for oily people and also makes your skin feel lighter and cooler. definitely will purchase again",positive
"my skin felt good after using this product but for, i expected it would be better at removing makeup.",neutral
"i have been looking into skincare with sun protection lately, naturally supergoop was my first stop. a moisturizer with spf was exactly what i was and still am looking for. this is heavy and greasy, but seems to actually do a decent job as a moisturizer overall. it is the fragrance that really gets me. it smells like skincare my mum used when i was growing up, you know, back before the idea of perfumed products causing irritation on top of containing completely superfluous ingredients was commonly accepted. anyway... yeah, it is okay, but i am going to keep look for something a little less heavy-handed in both fragrance and weight.",neutral
it definitely does not sting as bad as some have said but maybe that is because i have a lot of scarring from years of acne. great price and makes my face feel soft. have not noticed a ton of improvement yet.,neutral
"i have been using this product as part of a set for two days. unfortunately my skin does not love it as much as i hoped it would. while it feels great after use, my skin ended up with dry patches coming back. this is something i have been fighting for a while, so while i love the brand and wanted to love the set, i just cannot keep using it.",neutral
i liked how the applicator felt cool to the touch on my skin upon applying this product. it was not greasy and it was easy to use.,neutral
"i have been using this serum for a few days and i love it. it is lightly scented, but not over powering at all. it dries fairly quickly and does not leave a sticky residue. if you look at the first picture, you will notice some skin dullness but on the second picture my face is glowy and full of life after using it consistently day and night for about a week. definitely recommend it. for reference i have combo skin.",positive
"i read the reviews about this hurting the eyes, and thought it will not happen to me because my eyes are not sensitive. wrong! i was at a baseball game and i was miserable with stinging eyes. then i had to drive hours..i ran inside and washed my face as soon as i got home and i will never use this again!!",negative
does not work. i really like the idea but the areas i used them on kept getting worse after using the stickers all night.,negative
"i literally created a profile just to review this moisturizer. i got a sample of this from sephora for my birthday and i was so excited to try it because of all the great things i heard from drunk elephant. this experience has been the most disappointing due to the prestige of the brand, the hype around it, and the price point. i used this on my face in march and right after i got tiny bumps all over my cheeks that were red and blotchy, then got really dry, and took a few days to go away. i thought that these were possibly from my travels or some other factor. i stopped using the product regardless because i did not like how it felt on the face, feeling thick and almost mattefying. two days ago i decided to put this product to use once again but this time for my neck at night time. the next morning, i woke up with my neck all red and slightly itchy with tiny little bumps. today, one day after, those bumps still prevalent and feel extremely dry. i now know that the previous reaction on my face is the exact same as this one on my neck and is due to this moisturizer. if i was the only one who had this reaction i would say it is probably my own fault due to my seneisitive skin, but seeing so many other star reviews saying it gave them the exact same reaction, i would say to totally avoid this product!! something that can trigger a skin irritation like this across the board obviously has some ingredients that are probably not best for the skin, so proceed with caution!!",negative
this stuff did absolutely nothing to improve my dark spots. no bueno.,negative
"i was gifted kate somerville liquid exfolikate triple acid resurfacing treatment by sephora and i am really pleasantly surprised! the regular exfolikate does leave my skin a little irritated after use, although the effect the next day is nice, so i was a little nervous about using this. i dove right in, though, and experienced absolutely no irritation from the product! i did not notice majorly dramatic results, but it left my skin looking more radiant and feeling very smooth. i have been using this every other day to avoid irritation and it is working well!",positive
no improvement to my skin whatsoever. i tried it out for two weeks and saw no difference. i returned for a new serum,negative
results are noticeable right away and keeps skin hydrated,positive
"my skin has changed from oily to combination to dry over the years. after using the same brand cleanser for several years, my skin skin has also become sensitive. this toner helped to calm my skin and allowed for better absorption of the moisturizer, helping to achieve a more hydrated and supple appearance. love this product!",positive
this did not seem to make a big difference on my skin but does because my skin to turn very red underneath. i have sensitive skin so i was not surprised but wish i noticed more benefits from this mask. it has worked well for friends of mine so i would say it is worth a try.,neutral
"the scent and texture of the product is good, however the exfoliating part does not stay very long and then it gets extremely oily on the face. it does not exactly leave your face feeling clean.",neutral
the color develops nicely and smoothly however there is an orange hue to the skin for sure. it did leave me glowy and soft. i noticed that after a week or so the product was actually scraping off my skin. i could scratch it off with my fingernails and it left lines and weird residue will not. be buying again.,neutral
so hard to get out of package and smooth onto skin. it rips and is lumpy.,negative
"this mask truly transforms your face. i bought this mask due to a reaction i had all over my forehead from a new primer hoping it would help. this mask not only cleared up my forehead within uses but it is brightened up my entire complexion. listen, every time i break out my skin decides to scar for what feels like months but after using this for days straight they are almost undetectable. i am not over exaggerating i have never seen my skin look so beautiful. this mask is in fact pricy but the results make it so worth it. i will continue to purchase this mask over and over. its magic! if you are questioning buying this mask, do not! but it. you will be amazed and extremely happy with the results. beautiful skin is what we all want and with this mask beautiful skin is what you will have.",positive
"was excited to try this, it is full of ingredients that are good for my skin. sadly, it was just too rough on my sensitive skin. i guess the volcanic pumice was too strong for me. it is easy to use, seems to work fairly well. most of my skin was bright, but my cheeks and around my mouth where my skin is most sensitive became irritated and red. it faded within a few hours but, too much for me still. you get a good amount for the money and my t zone felt and looked healthy after use. i just have other products that work and that i can use for my whole face.",neutral
"it does not clean my face, not work well to wash makeup remover on my face. it is good for very dry skin because it will not let your skin dry. for me, i do not feel clean after using it. will not but it again.",negative
"the product itself is fine, an average eye mask. but there is so much excess packaging for only set of eye masks. not worth it in my opinion.",neutral
cannot quit rate it yet think my spots are getting lighter though i plan on rating once i complete the bottle,neutral
this is okay. i was hoping for more of a moisturizer that has spf in it but the way this feels on my skin it feels more like a traditional spf rather than a moisturizer. it has not broken me out and does not have a scent. but it feels heavy and sticky on my skin and i feel like it does not soak in like a moisturizer. i will use this on beach days but its not my favorite for an every day moisturizer.,neutral
"i have been using this product for months and it has done nothing for my skin, waste of money. there are way better facial oils out there.",negative
"this is the only product i like from this line. other than this i am not willing to try anything else out but i did try out their cica sleeping mask which i did write a review on too but that sleeping mask did not work out for me.this toner is very moisturizing. i enjoy it. did not irritate my skin or because me to breakout. i have sensitive, acne prone and eczemarosacea skin. i would say if you are curious, give it a try. and especially if you have dry skin, this toner is for you.",positive
definitely saw an improvement in my skin texture after about a week and half of use. i have no breakouts either. i guess the vit c gave my natural barrier some immunity. i suggest adding a vit c to your skin care routine every single morning and this one from sunday riley is the best one to use.,positive
i would not really recommend this. the honeymoon glow is amazing but this product has a strange scent and does not seem to do much. i would try something different.,neutral
i absolutely love this mask. i mostly use it as a face wash and i notice my face is instantly brighter after use. i originally got this as a sample and then purchased the mini size. i love this product so much i will keep this in my skin care routine moving forward.,positive
"i got a mini version as a free sample and loved it! went on nicely and i began to notice a difference in my skin. i bought the larger size and it is like a whole new product! it smells, is stick, and feelslooks super greasy on my face. i do not know how or why there is such a huge difference from the mini version to the bigger version.",negative
youth in a bottle! the ultimate goal of skincare is making your skin feel youthful and clear without makeup and this delivers.it applies really smooth almost like a primer. giving my skin a youthful bounce and brightens. goes on great under moisturizer without losing its power. my skin looks awake and refreshed.,positive
first time ever trying this product and i am so confused! it is impossible to apply the product on your skin.. it gets a little bubbley when you are applying then dries in. seconds and is just a sticky mess! you can feel the sticky layer just sitting on top of your skin and it makes it impossible to put anything else on top.,negative
"ugh...i want to love this, because it feels divine going on it is smells beautifully and, the packaging is so luxurious. however, i think it is overpriced for the effectiveness of the product. it is a very heavy cream, so it leaves my skin kind of oily overnight maybe that is the point for safekeeping moisture. on initial opening, the packaging was overly and unnecessarily difficult to work with. i still think all the plastic, compartments, etc. are unnecessary although it is beautiful. i am just kind meh on this.",neutral
i really like the way these feel on my eyes. very soothing. however i am not sure i was able to get much from it because i only had a single pair of patches. i love these type of eye patch masks and it did help my eyes look brighter and my bags look less visible after one use. i am sure over time it would really help!,positive
i received this product as a gift for review purposes and i tell you that i am lucky enough to get it this product have serum like texture it is smooth on skin it light weight not heavy it reduced redness instantly yes i would recommend it to others,neutral
i really liked it in the beginning. it did not feel oily on my skin at all and had a great smell to it. unfortunately it broke me out a lot. i will be returning! i love fab and most of their products but i guess because my skin is oily combination it did not do me that great!,neutral
this is the perfect first step to remove sunscreen and makeup after a long day!,positive
"just been using for days, my skin is already glowing. i use this with glow recipe dew drops.",positive
"i have combo skin. it dried my skin out, helped reduce my acne minutely. however after a week or two of using the product, my skin was really bad again. way too over priced. the packaging makes you dispence way to much product. and the product is super thick. so you get a decent amount of product but unless you are careful and smart with it, the cleanser will not last you a while.",negative
no noticeable difference with use. somewhat disappointing because typically enjoy tatcha products.,negative
finally a vitamin c i can use. i have very sensitive oily skin and i got no rashes or breakout. takes bout m to absorb but totally worth it. spots are fading. i mix it with my snail essence followed by sunscreen.,positive
"i have no doubt that this is hydrating. i have not had it long enough to see results.the consistency is so thick, it is like trying to rub in rubber glue to your skin. i tried to use it with my rose quartz eye massager tool and the tool just pulls my skin. too sticky and not ideal for an eye massage. i guess if the skin under my eyes were super dry this might be ideal, but for an everyday eye cream, i do not recommend.",neutral
"this is a wonderful dose of retinol that you do not have to get from your dermatologist. i cannot use this every night because this can be harsh on the skin, but i am thrilled with the results. it feels good to take care of my skin and i trust drunk elephant products. as we age, it is so important to understand retinols, ahas, bhas, and other chemical exfoliants. do your research- if you decided a retinol would benefit your skincare routine, this is a wonderful one. i would say that the price is extremely reasonable- a little goes a long way.",positive
i used to use the fresh soy cleanser and to be honest used it got a few years but i started to realize it was not doing anything for my skin and felt like a waste of money. i bought this because i read the reviews on it for how great it is for dry skin and wow it is been so good for my skin!! it has such a foamy creamy lather and smells so light and clean. i genuinely love this product and will be repurchasing!!,positive
i love this sunscreen!! i put a light layer on every morning and my skin looks dewey and glows! absorbs nicely and my makeup goes on easily on top! definitely a staple for me and i love that it is clean ingredients.,positive
does not perform for my eye makeup removal. it has yet to remove my non-waterproof eye makeup and i have done double cleanse with it and have not been stingy. besides it being unable to perform for mascara removal the smell and moisturized feeling are pleasant enough. i had purchased this as a travel make up remover since it would not spill like a liquid version.,negative
"i had tried a small size of this before and loved it. a few other cleansing oilbalms later, i purchased the full size of this. i was super disappointed. it leaves a bit of a residue. when i tried to remove eye makeup, no matter how well i rinsed, a weird film would get into my eyes for a few minutes. for that reason alone, i will not repurchase this nor recommend it. on top of that, i felt like i was still finding traces of mascara or eyeliner. i found myself getting a cleaner result just using water on a makeup eraser, and ended up always having to essentially use my makeup eraser in the same way as if i had not even used this cleanser. double work? no thanks.",neutral
"i generally love this brand, but one this that disappointed me with this particular product was that there was a huge air bubble in the product, in the jar. so instead of getting a full jar of product, i probably got like half a jar. this is incredibly disappointing, because it is so expensive. this also happened with their moisturizer. overall, it does help reduce texture on the face and is a good exfoliant, but considering the price and the amount of missing product, i would consider looking into another brand once i am finished with this jar.",neutral
seems to be working on skin texture which is a major concern. i have tried several inkey list products and they have all worked wonderful.,positive
"after a month of using this and hoping it would work, it did not. it gave me chemical burns under my eyes. so much texture and dryness now and i never had this issue before. i want to return it but it is been over days and i do not have the original packaging",negative
"i received a free sample of the inkey list retinol anti-aging serum to try. unfortunately i did not care for this product. the smell was not very appealing, it left my skin feeling tacky after it was applied. i also began to experience an increase in acne after using the product. i have balanced to dry skin normally, without occurrences of acne. perhaps this product would work better on other individuals.",negative
it does what it is supposed to do as far as cleaning your face and most of your makeup. i definitely recommend double washing though... it was just eh... good for teensyoung adults who want to start with a basic routine.,neutral
not a huge fan of the smell but has helped to decrease the size of my pores!,positive
"this product is amazing, i got it in a holiday kit never knew about it before. life changing, i do not get pimples very often but when i do it is bothersome nobody wants them and they always show up at the most inopportune times. i placed this on went to bed woke up and it was like it sucked it out of my face! seriously, like magic. i do not know how to really explain it you just have to try it!",positive
"unfortunately this did not work well with my skin. i have very sensitive combination oily skin and this did not provide any moisture or softness. it tingles a bit too much for my skin, i do not recommend them product at all. i will stick to my hyaluronic acid.",negative
i have drycombo skin and this did not keep my skin hydrated throughout the day. i love the sleeping mask though!,neutral
"i love paulas choice retinol treatment, i started using this product every other night after washing my face, after about weeks i noticed the fine lines around my eyes were definitely less noticeable, my skin started looking firmer and actually younger, this product was gifted by paulas choice",positive
"i received this product complimentary from farmacy beauty. i love products from farmacybeauty so much! their design is so pretty. bha is one of my favorite ingredients in skincare since i have combo skin with large pores on t-zone. once using, it feels so refreshing soothing. i did not see any irritation or redness on skin. also i love that it is cruelty free. greencleanupcrew",positive
i personally love this product! i have sensitive skin and very light skin so i am always a bit skeptical however this works beautifully for me. i use it on top of the yttp clean caffeine serum and it soaks right into my skin! super refreshing,positive
"first off, i received this product in exchange for an honest review. i thought this product was okay. not horrible, but not amazing. i have dry-combo acne prone skin, so keep this in mind. i do not think my skin benefitted from using this at all. it smells like there is fragrance in it, which was off-putting for me as well. i used it according to the instructions, and my skin was fine! if you are gentle, you probably will not experience extreme discomfort. i felt like it left a residue on my skin, though. i used it twice a week for a month alongside my usual routine and did not see or feel any discernible difference, except for the weird residue. if you like physical exfoliants, maybe you will like this! but i did not see much of a difference, and i recommend chemical exfoliants. i would not buy the full sized product personally, especially if you are new to exfoliating.",neutral
this product is just okay. the smell is very over powering and leaves a stickiness to the skin.,negative
i had high hopes for this cleanser but it left a lot of residue behind which is not what i am going for. overall the consistency of the product is great. i love their other products just this cleanser did not do it for me.,negative
"perfect for my combo skin! i use the watermelon toner before this and then the moisturizer and it sinks in so well, has helped with redness and hydrated my skin without looking one bit oily! so glad i bought this! if you have drier skin this can definitely be a serum but for my oily skin with dry areas it works so well for me! i do use a thicker cream at night but for day this is amazing",positive
this did nothing. did not see any noticeable difference in my skin. disliked scent. do not waste your since nothing about this product justifies the overpriced tag.,neutral
i am only disappointed in this product. i really like the face cream but this honestly did nothing for my dry skin. i can see this working more for someone with oily skin? felt little to no hydration.... while the packaging is great the formula needs work. i will be sticking to korean snail masks,negative
"every time i open it, it squeezes out a lot... and i cannot stand the smell the first time i used it... i feel stinky! but i thought it might work... still no! ah, bought and not willing to throw away! the app customer service staff recommended this brand and another one called farmacy- waterless vitamin c serum! the results were also not good! i tried to reduce the spots! it did not work at all...",negative
i use this ampm everyday and it keeps my dry skin in check! absolute staple.,positive
the product removes my makeup well but it still leaves the melted makeup under my eyes. i have to use a cloth to remove the rest which kind of defeats the purpose. it adds another step to my regimen which i am not a fan off but i not deal breaker.,positive
"great product, horrible pump. the product dries up in there and the nozzle is too tiny and then you have to pump extra to get the solidified parts out.",neutral
"the smell is awful, only used times because it says to use once then after a week you can work up to daily use but i cannot do the smell at all, it is worse than bleach honestly i do not know if it helped my skin but i know results were little to none",negative
"i like the idea of this product. it did work well for me, my one gripe with this one is again the formulation. it is so heavy in silicones. did not work well under my sunscreen or makeup for me.",neutral
"these work really well. i have bad hormonal acne from pcos and these patches completely get rid of any spot i put them on in- nights. that said, they are overpriced given the average price point of the many comparable healing dots available elsewhere. a solid three stars for a solid product, but i will go with a cheaper version that works just as well.",neutral
"no all these reviews are complaining because this is not a peel-off mask but this mask works so well. i liked the ordinarys ahabha mask but i love this. it is so gentle, it does not sting when you put it on and you can see and feel the results right after using it i am in love",positive
i received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. do not like this smell at all. smells like glue. i am not impressed with it at all. i would not purchase over other products.,negative
"i received a sample of this and am glad i did not buy the full size. it is very balmy, it is quite thick and did not absorb into my skin. it left a weird film on my face and in some places clumped up and left white bits all over. my skin is on the dryer side but this was just too heavy for me.",negative
it gets the job done. but using it dry is really hard. i recommend putting water on your hand then apply that way it washes it off better. for size and price it is good again just add water on your hand.,neutral
"decent product, absorbed well. the serum is very runny. i expect better results but this serum is not that concentrated. for this price point, it is a good product.",neutral
"i been trying this moisturizer out for about a week now... i like it but i do not love it. i love that it is moisturizing, and have a high spf and pollution protection. it does everything it claims and passes cosdna. however it should come in a pump container, i hate putting my hands into my products and the product is constantly exposed. the next problem with this product is you can feel it on your skin all day. it does not fully absorb into the skin and is slightly tack all day. i have combination oily skin so i would prefer if it did not have a glowly finish. the first time i used it i used way to much, a little goes a long way. now i take a nickel size amount and i found that is enough. i like it i will continue to use it for now but would i recommend it maybe i have to continue to use it more. supergoop if you could make another moisturizer for combo oily skin and put this in a pump it would be perfect!",neutral
i wanted to like this so much but it was too greasy for me and it did not absorb into my skin at all.,negative
"if you are a beginner i highly recommend this. the first time i tried it, it did smudge a little and it left me a little orange just for one day, but every time after that it worked perfectly. be sure not to use it overnight without a window open, otherwise you sweat, and sweating smudging. it worked perfect for me for a long time but after a while it started to smell bad and little white strings appeared inside. i reached out to isle of paradise and they told me this is a result of warmer climates, but it should still work well- and it did, so i removed the strings from inside the bottle. later on, the spray stopped working entirely. i still have over half a bottle of spray left and it just does not do anything.",neutral
"i received this as the trial size ml. it was at least half empty, and the contents were nothing like the images online- the moisturizer was hardened and not creamy at all. even though it was just a trial size i was very disappointed. would certainly not entice me to buy it!",negative
i have been using the vip lab sample wild huckleberry-acid polishing peel gifted by alpyn beauty. it feels gentle on my skin when i am rubbing it. definitely gives me a glow right away after using it. their beads is really not hard unlike others tat can hurt your skin while massaging it. i love the creaminess of this polish mask.,positive
"i agree with all the other reviews about the scent, it is very, very overpowering, and i am usually someone who likes scented products. i put it on about two hours ago, and can still smell it lolhowever, my skin seems to like it and it absorbed rather nicely. not sure if i would purchase because of the scent, but i will still probably use the rest of my sample size tube.",neutral
"i have dehydrated skin all year long, but it gets especially dry in the winter. i use this before i apply a retinol as i do not want to wake up with tightness or flakes, the combination works out beautifully leaving me with soft and well hydrated skin. this also helps calm and get rid of small hormonalstress related acne breakouts. i love the way it feels, slightly oily before it dries down with a bit of tack, but that is wonderful for multilayered skincare regimens. highly recommend it to my fellow sensitive skin people, absolutely lush! even my mum uses this!",positive
"this bottle lasts so long, i bought this a year ago last november and after daily use it is only half empty! i cannot say that it does too much... it feels exactly like water but thankfully it is not just water- i tasted it. i like to think it makes my other products absorb better, but i cannot really tell. the bottle is beautiful however, it is heavy and feels super luxe. probably one of the nicest vanity items ever. i cannot say much about how well it works. there are other toners out there that are more moisturizing and much cheaper, but it does last a loooong time and the bottle is gorgeous. not sure if that is worth paying over for though...",neutral
i truly wish sephora would be able to offer the entire ageless revitalizing line. the neck cream was the first of this line i tried and i was pleasantly surprised. i approached skincare products with heaping skepticism. tried many and be impressed by few. this neck cream glides on and does not leave a sticky layer. the texture is elegant. it does not disappear in a couple hours. once am and pm last all day. i use vey little each time and it helps my aging neck looks soft and is soft. i am so happy to find this product.,positive
this is one of my hg products for when i have texture on my face. before i purchased i read quite a few reviews and stumbled across one where a girl had said she was not seeing results until they tried this as an overnight mask.. amazing. this helps when i am having breaks out or issues with texture on my foreheadcheek bones. i only use this as an overnight mask and i wash off in the morning. there is a fragrance to this product so if that is something that bothers you i would get a sample before purchasing- besides that i think this product is a must-try.,positive
great product! loved the exfoliation. it gives a very fresh feel and spa like feeling.,positive
"it leaves a glowy and slightly tacky finish. so makeup wears great over this sunscreen. it feels lightweight which is great for summer time. it has a light watermelon scent. i think people who does not like sunscreen scent would really like this! it has a milky consistency, so i could apply this all over my face easily. one big miss for me, it peels bad, especially on hairline and eyebrows. i think it will peel bad for people who have lots of peach fuzz all over their face. my eyebrow becomes a mess whenever i put this one. i am excited to see this sunscreens skincare benefits after consistent use.",neutral
"i was on the hunt for an everyday sunscreen i am black and most sunscreens leave a white cast, so i wanted something that would go on light and not coat my face in that pasty glow.i loved this sunscreen at first. it felt lightweight, i could wear it without looking like a ghost, and i was feeling myself knowing my skin was protected. after a couple weeksmonths of wear, i started to notice that i was breaking out like crazy, with deep pimples popping up on my cheeks and forehead. i was certain it had to be something else, so i started to play with my skincare routine, but that was not it. it was not until recently that i realized that the only constant during this period of breakout has been the supergoop sunscreen, and after doing a little research, i have seen that some others have faced similar struggles. i guess my skin does not love the formula, and i am sad because its back to the drawing board for me!",neutral
i love the ole henriksen truth serum and i wanted to give this a try. this reminded me of the sunday riley vitamin c...it irritated my skin by causing multiple acne bumpsmore break outs. the truth serum would be a safer recommendation if you are looking for a vitamin c and you are a be prone.,negative
"i decided to get this product because i was in need of a new one, however when applied this sunscreen will peel! i do not recommend this, it also made me very greasy shortly after i applied",negative
"i have used about bottles of this. at first it made my skin glowy. then i started to notice small red bumps and milia over my forehead. i stopped using it, and it took a while to get better, but my pimples would come again. it controls pimples but it gives a lot of bumps and milia. for now, i just apply a tad on problem areas like chin. other than that, i will not be using this again. i ditched this and stuck to an all natural toner, of witch hazel and cucumber. my skin is doing much better in less than a week.",negative
"i have oily skin and am prone to acne. this is a gentle, but good, cleanser! my skin was mostly smooth, with a few small acne bumps on my forehead that i struggled to get rid of, but adding this to my routine cleared up those small bumps in a couple of days! it does not have a strong scent to me, and i love that it comes in a small glass jar. i can buy the full size and reuse the small one for travel.",positive
"this stuff is the real deal. i pair this toner with murad environmental shield orange label. the toner itself causes a brief sting when applied with a pad after washing your face but nothing major. if you have sensitive spots on your skin like i do, i would recommend wiping around those areas. the toner leaves your skin with a dewy finish which is where the glow comes in. it also adds for moisture so if you have oily skin, you will not need too much moisturizer with this product. i did also notice that acne scarring went away much faster when using this toner. i first received a free sample and then returned to purchase a month later. the product has longevity!",positive
the packaging on this product is so cute! this was a thicker formula than i imagined and left my skin looking very dewy and glowy. it did appear to give me a slight white cast even under makeup. it also felt like it did not dry down very well. it also very much was burning my eyes.,neutral
was super excited because i desperately need a good moisturizer. i opened my package today and am so disappointed that i may only get a few days out of this. my jar seems barely over half full.,negative
"removes all makeup and leaves skin soft, without drying or irritation. smells nice!",positive
i have had good experience with micro-needle dots for my occasional cystic acne. so i was excited to see a similar concept to deliver retinol deeper into my skin. this is not that product. it had trouble sticking even though i carefully cleanser beforehand to get rid of excess oil. i do not have oily skin. it fell off every evening i tried to put it on. do not waste your money.,negative
sunday riley gifted me. sunday riley has always been my favorite skincare brand and this new niacinamide serum is one of a kind. texture is nice and it applies very gently on the skin. i feel like my skin glows next day with this serum. so far so good.,positive
this was terrible. please save your money this does not work. i waited months before writing a review but i have not seen any results. it breaks your whole face out in little white dots in the beginning. they go away after a week. but the acne i had prior to use did not go away but got worse. i even lessened the application but still nothing. i hope you guys take into consideration my review especially if your are a woc because i am starting to think it might not be made for our skin.,negative
this made my face red and did not feel hydrating just sticky and not glowy. niacinimide helps with redness but the fragrance made it worse,negative
after only uses i have noticed the first bit of product squeezed out of the tip is oxidized now. i wipe it away and use the second bit squeezed out but still a little off putting to see it. this is probably a chemical reaction with the stainless steel tip but it would be better if it was a plastic tip instead.,negative
the product itself is very well put together and it tastes better than other whitening products. it did not work for me though and i am so disappointed! it barely made a difference and if anything it made them look worse.,negative
i mean not a bad product but not for oily skin. broke me out but it did remove most of my makeup.,negative
"i am a huge fan of glow recipe- their products have saved me many times from sudden changes in my skin texture especially their serums and banana souffle. highly recommend. sadly, this was not one of them. i do not fault the product at all, as, in the first few minutes, my skin did feel incredible and cleansed, but after that, my skin became extremely parched, covered in zits, and painfully dry. it was only after switching this cleanser out for another that i realised that this was a little too harsh for my skin.-- i would recommend this product for anyone who is having extreme difficulty with very oily or acne-prone skin, but be warned that if your skin is sensitive, this cleanser may be a little harsh, even with an intense moisturising routine.-- the scent is very nice and i did not find it too overwhelming. i would describe it as soapy as opposed to overly fruity, but it is not that dollar-store-soap scent. the cleansing experience was enjoyable and i adore how easy it was to use. it just is not the product for me.",neutral
"pros- spreads easily and absorbs quickly.- high spf and broad spectrum.- wears well underneath concealer and light-coverage make up.- for the brand, it is a good price for the amount of product you get.cons- very noticeable fragrance it is pretty sweet smell, it goes away after a bit though.- slight tackygreasy feel after it fully absorbs.",positive
absolutely hated it would not recommend,negative
"i really actually enjoyed this toner! i was excited to try it and test the gentle factor and it is extremely gentle! its got a very calm, gentle scent as well... nothing off putting! i i thoroughly enjoyed this and will likely buy more!!",positive
"i was skeptical of this product because it does look like water, but it smells amazing and has made a drastic difference in my skin after- uses. i have an oily skin type and this worked great for me. my skin is smoother and softer. would recommend!",positive
"i have been meaning to set aside time to write this review. i have only been using this product and product line for three weeks now and have seen betterfaster results than i have ever experienced. once i entered my late s i am now i started struggling with acne, predominately around my hair line near my ear and under my jaw. i have tried so many different products. i usually prefer to use clean beautify and natural beauty products but did not see the desired results and even was left off with worse skin in some cases. i have tried curology.....and nothing. i decided to completely change it up and i came across the inkey list! because the products are so affordable i decided to try multiple products on their line. in addition to the cleaner i picked up the pha toner, peptide moisturizer, and tranexamic acid night treatment to target my acne scars. i also picked up the peterthomasroth pumpkin enzyme mask and never have i ever experienced such great results with clearing my skin and lightening my acne scars. i have also focused on staying well hydrated and changing my pillow case every two days. i am not sure which thing impacted the results more but since using these products and making these specific changes i feel like i am well on my way to clearer skin.after thought my skin was very textured and bumpy around my problem area and could even be visible under makeup. now my skin is completely smooth and have not had a single breakout in that area. now just working on ace scaring and maintaining my clear skin. hope this helps someone!",positive
"for full disclosure, i received this from influenster to test and review honestly. this mask combo is smells and feels very very fragranced. if you like rose, you would like this. if not....you might want to find an alternative. upon putting on the gel, i noticed tingling- almost stinging sensation and blotchiness. i would not consider my skin to be extremely sensitive, as i use chemical exfoliants daily. would that be a factor? possibly. but could also be the ingredients. the creamy mask is equally fragrant and seals moisture. however, this is partially due to the use of parraffin in their ingredients. paraffin will sit on top of your skin, making it feel soft and moisturized, but nothing moisturizing is really sinking into your skin. so there you have it fragrant, insensitive, and use of ingredients for effectiveness stars off. would i buy this? no. i do not find it worth my money, and i am willing to splurge for my skincare if does what it says and if the ingredients are clean and purposeful.",negative
"i really wanted to love this, after all of the glowing reviews i have heard, but every time i tried to use it my skin broke out. i am not giving it star because it did hydrate well, but it definitely was not worth the breakouts.",negative
"i received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. i loved the packaging, however the product is a very average product. it i moisturizing, however i did not see anything special about it",neutral
the name alone is a reason to love this product but love how huda products leave my skin feeling and looking refreshed not the chemical overindulgence but refreshing. skiin glows with thirst trap and hydtates my skin to perfection,positive
"i am african-american and i had some hyper pigmentation and some dark marks,this cream had really good reviews so i bought it but it has absolutely did nothing to lighten,i have been using this for a little over a month now,save your money,it is a good moisturizer but sometime after using it i noticed that i was getting these little small bumbs on my check and i believe they were whiteheads which i never had before",negative
i am a big fan of face masks and i have tried many from sephora but i keep going back to this one. it feels like your face just got a cold flash of life to it and feels amazing when you rinse it off. i find my skin feeling so refreshed after i use it and it helps calm down any imperfections redness i have going on.,positive
"i have been using this product for a few weeks. prior to this, i used the ordinary hyaluronic acid. i do not mind this product but i feel like it is hard to get the product out of the wand. i think i will go back to the ordinary.",neutral
"i received this cleanser for free thru influenster and wow, i really love it!! i have combo skin with some reoccurring dry spots and i do not find this cleanser to dry me out or leave my skin feeling tight or irritated. it really does glide into your skin and makes your skin feel really clean and fresh. i thoroughly remove my makeup prior to washing my face so i cannot say whether it fully removes your makeup or not, although it is not an issue for me personally. i truly do love this product and i cannot wait to continue using it!",positive
the smell is not too strong which is good for a toner. it is not too oily and adds a nice shine to my skin. i am a little hesitant to put it on my face with my skin.,neutral
"received sample, it is very cheap scrub it will make your face very rough.",negative
it is not as great as other vitamin c serums but it is a good price. i have combo skin and find that if i use this before my makeup routine there is a film that develops that begins to crumble at the end of the day which is kind of weird and makes me think it does not absorb that well.,neutral
"i am so very disappointed in this product af tree r using it for a while. the tube is clogged.. when i manage to dig some product out, it turns to a white paste after i apply it. i am positive it has been closed toght after each use. what a waste of a lot of money.",negative
i love rolling my face after i put serum on and it has become a daily part of my routine. the only cons are that the bigger roller pops off with too much pressure on my face i roll very lightly. my eyelashes also got stuck on the smaller roller so i avoid the eye area with this. it has improved my skin texture over all though and really helps my serum and moisturizer soak in.,neutral
"it is an overall good toner, it feels great after applying it and smells good, however, after using the whole bottle, i did not notice any big changes with my dark spots.",neutral
"to be honest, i do not see much change, but i am also going through unusually bad breakouts right now...",neutral
i got this in the holiday set with the serum and lip balm. but this mask burns my face and then it goes away. i do not recommend. now i only use it on my hands and feet. i wish the made it without the essential oils.,negative
i do like but it did not do anything for my skin i had high hopes from what i heard but the retinol is a better option then this,neutral
"this moisturizer is my nd favorite in the kora line with the turmeric glow being my all-time favorite. if you have ultra-dry skin like mine, you may find you need to apply a couple layers of this to leave your skin feeling hydrated-- my skin seems to just eat this right up i have heavier layers applied in the image attached. that being said, i bet combooily skin types would find this moisturizer to be a dream come true. it has a very subtle earthynatural smell to it that i actually really enjoy, and it layers well under an spf or heavier moisturizer without pilling. as we move into the warmer more humid months, i can see myself grabbing this off the shelf more often. all in all, it is a win in my book, however with my skin being so dry, i cannot say this moisturizer when used alone is enough.",positive
the moisturizer works well and feels great on the skin.,positive
"being acne prone, i am hesitant to try new products...but this!! subtle glow, light coverage and of course sun protection!",positive
this just absorbs right on the skin. no kind of shine. so thin just does not do anything to my skin. i was so disappointed in this. would not recommend.,negative
i felt like this did nothing but make me look a tiny bit oilier.,negative
i leave this on my face for minute and it started to get red. will not recommend this for sensitive skin.,negative
"i received this product as a complimentary sample from influenster. all options and thoughts are honest and my own. i started using this product at night before my moisturizer. by day of using it, i had pimples all over my face. i was not a ton of pimples, but enough to stop using it. it is not really for sensitive and rosacea-prone skin. i rarely get pimples so when something changes in my skincare routine and i wake up with pimples, i have to stop whatever i am using and stick with the basic stuff until the reaction is gone. the glass bottle is luxurious and i love the texture of the serum because it is oily and like a wet texture but the skin soaks it up. my skin just did not agree with the ingredients in it. i really hope it works for someone.",negative
it takes off all my waterproof eye makeup in one step without irritation to my eyes and lashes. very gentle yet extremely effective. my bottle does not have the leaking issue like others. however i do think changing the package will improve the control of dispensing the right amount of product to accommodate everyone is needs.,positive
"i am not a huge fan of this moisturizer. i thought i would love it but it is pretty thick and heavy on the skin. i think it would be better for someone with a dry skin type, but for my oilycombo skin it left me feeling shiny and greasy.",negative
"i bought this moisturizer on ipsy. my thoughts on this product is that it is way too hydrating for my combo skin. it clogged my pores and i do not feel like my skin is it. i will stop using it, and continue with my lapis oil from herbivore.",negative
"i bought this for anti aging benefits after reading good reviews. i have enjoyed using it in my routine- the texture and light smell are nice. however, i have not noticed any particular effects, and after running out have not seen any changes, either. seemed to be a bit of an eh product for my skin.",neutral
"i bought this after getting it in a beauty box because i really liked the green color toning down my red skin. but after buying a full size, i noticed that it tended to make my skin look more dry, dull, and weirdly flaky. i love dr jarts ther cicapair products especially their cream, and i adore the ceramidin line, but this ended up being a dud. i now use a sephora x pantone color correcting palette on top of ceramidin when i want to address red tones and it overall works a lot better.",neutral
"i was not as excited about this product as ai thought i would have been. i have pretty dry skin all over, but significantly in my t zone. when i first put this on, i felt like my soul was being pulled out through my pores. my skin was ever drier than normal and my foundation looked awful. i ended up going to the bathroom and washing off my makeup halfway through my shift it was so bad. i was gifted this product for testing purposes.",negative
"i bought this product because i loved the glow recipe mini set, but i am trying it tonight for the first time and my whole face is red and burning.",negative
"my skin looks smoother and brighter. it is not extremely moisturizing, but it does provide some moisture as my skin is less flakey. i like it.",positive
"this is the first cleanser i have used that does not make my face feel tight and dry after using! i put a pea sized amount on the center of my clarisonic and go to work. i have fairly dry skin, occasionally i am greasy in my t-zone in the summer, but during the winter i am flaky and sensitive. i would not call this my holy grail, but i actually used my whole bottle and will probably buy again.",positive
"i received a sample of this product and used it for about three weeks. i honestly did not notice a difference. it did not do anything bad to my under eye area in terms of irritation but it also did not have any effect on the fine lines, puffiness, or darkness in my under eye area.",neutral
"i received the travel size as a free sample, and holy balls. after trying just once, the texture of my skin is completely smooth, it is plump and bouncy, it looks radiant. i normally have the driest skin known to man, and this is changing the game completely for me. a must have in my skin care routine now. i am so freaking impressed.",positive
"i love it! i am extremely pale so it gives a nice glow and i have not had any problems wearing it under makeup. i normally wear it alone with concealer, blush, etc. i have sensitive skin too no breakouts so far!",positive
"i received this product as a free sample. there is an odor from the container. i could smell it on my face until it dried. once it dried, the smell dissipated. i used it at night. the next morning my skin was very soft. i did not really notice any changes to my skin. i might consider buying it if there is a price drop.",neutral
"i have used jars of this moisturizer and i would say it is just meh. it is hydrating but it peels a lot. if you put it under your foundation, you can see it peeling and it looks very bad. for this price i expect it to do be better",neutral
"it pills does not layer well with serums. aside from that, when rubbed into the skin, it gives a nice glow does not leave a white cast on my skin tone. i hope they come out with a mini.",positive
"it is super liquidy i put it in my hand it goes through my fingers, i put it directly on my skin and in rolls through my eye brows and into my eye. i have pretty normal skin, not acne prone, and this in the recent change in my routine and i have started to break out. not for me",neutral
"works really well, however you can get x the acne patches for the price at the drugstore or elsewhere that work the exact same. in my opinion, not worth the money.",neutral
this product leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and soft. it does have a strong scent but i am not sensitive to scent. if that is a problem for you then you might want to skip this product. the actual performance of this product though is great. it is a great product that has now been added to my everyday routine. i would recommend this product. i did receive this product for free to review but these opinions are all my own.,positive
tried this new product and it worked great. i was pleasantly surprised that it really did take off all the oils off my skin and left it free if everything and ready for cleanser. it was easy to use and worked quickly. the thing i was not a fan of was the fact that its another step in my cleaning routine. it really does set up your face though to absorb the cleanser and my face really did feel cleaner afterwards. i recieved this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes but it does not in any way affect how i feel about this product.,positive
this product was way too thick for my oily skin and made me even more oily. it smells really nice but it felt really heavy on my skin and i had to take it off within an hour because i looked like i was starting to break out. the educational videos were great but the skin types they list are misleading.,neutral
"what is the hype? oh yeah forgot, its a bunch of influencers under age.click on verified purchases zilch!hydration? not. unless. you want a greasy oil slick that does not absorb, even after a face mask.does. not. work. tacky, shiney and makes more wrinkles than you had to start with, as it squeezes out all the natural water in your derma with acids and alcohols in it.lord jones, algenist and m.a.c. lightful work for building collagen and supporting the acid mantel of the dermis so it can heal itself.no topical gets rid of wrinkles without backlash.took two korean washes to get off and still my face is tacky and looks dehydrated and wrinkled.will need to redo again before bed and layer my normal serums.so disappointed.",negative
"this spot treatment is my favorite that i have found and tried out so far! i love that they included azelaic acid as an ingredient in this spot treatment as well as the bha, because i feel like that just makes it extra effective and not only is it a treatment for existing blemishes, but it can also work to prevent possible new ones as well! the actual texture of the product is a white cream, kind of a similar consistency as a typical moisturizer cream, that rubs completely into the skin so no white residue or anything is left after applying. i do feel like.oz is a pretty small amount of product, but since it is a spot treatment, i guess i am okay with it... would definitely recommend this as well as the skinfix brand as a whole!",positive
"this is a serious miracle. i bought this as a hail mary for an embarrassing situation on my chest and boobs and i have only had them days and they have noticeably improved my skin and they keep me from picking. i have no doubt that in a weeks time i will just be left with the aftermath that can be cleared up with a bit of retinol. if you have acne on your chest or back, i recommend this and murads acne spray. they have been the only thing that has worked and i have tried everything!",positive
"i received this product complimentary from hourglass. i was very curious about this new eye mask, so i put it to the test right away. i like the packaging, it definitely makes the application easier. the formula is very smooth and hydrating. i apply this mostly and night and leave it on overnight. i like that i am waking up in the morning with a more hydrated under eye area. overall i do enjoy this product, i have not seen significant changes on my skin i do have dark circles, puffiness sometimes and fine lines, maybe because i have not been using this product for long. i am planning to use it for a longer period of time and see it at its full potential. price point a bit high.",positive
great product but i hate the packaging! hard to get the last bit out.,positive
underwhelming- my acne barely reduced and it caused a little peeling,negative
personally loved this product for various reasons. one being clean beauty clean ingredients. secondly with having normal to dry skin this is soo hydrating. i do not know if one with oily skin would enjoy it as much. it is a thick cream but you do not need much- a little goes a long way. it is on my nightstand along with laneige lip mask. i have been looking forward to night time to use these products. i would recommend trying out the sephora favorites night time pack the lip mask is from there and will definitely be restocking both. there are also some great products in there as well.,positive
"this cult favorite is as good as the rave reviews, i wished it was not but as it goes it feels like water droplets and my skin soaks it up, and my skin is not dry. i love the feel of this cream and i really wish it was not as good because the price tag is steep for as often as i use it.",positive
my skin feels like a relaxed moisturized god you all should buy this like it is not oily and it does not really have a scent and i just feel amazing with it,positive
"i am in high school sophomore and i regularly check in with my dermatologist. during middle school and freshman year i was using the retinol that was prescribed to me. i do not have acne but it was destroying my skin and making things worse, i expressed that to her and she said it takes time for things to work. i had been using the products for four years so i took it upon myself to make my own skincaremakeup routine. this is the retinol i had researched and is what i now use! obviously this one product will not completely transform your skin but it works extremely well. the only thing is you have to wear sunscreen everyday even if you only use it once a week it makes your skin more sensitive to the sun and can cause more pores and acne worse if you do not wear sunscreen. i use eltamd spf i wish sephora sold it. i would give this retinol for effectiveness and being gentle on the skin",positive
"i tried this several times and all different types of acne, and it did nothing. the only benefit was it prevented me from picking at my acne.",negative
does make your skin feel smoother and cleaner. i did feel like i had to use a lot of product though. i wondered if the white balls were actually skin or if it was a gimmick with the formula. did some research into that and the sources said there is an ingredient that balls up which they claim takes the dead skin with it. so overall a bit of a gimmick since the white balls are not entirely dead skin but a way of making you feel that it is working more than it actually is. got say i do enjoy the experience but i will not be repurchasing.,neutral
"unfortunately, this product made my skin worst and now have cystic acne when i only had a few breakouts before. it works for other people but my skin it made a bad reaction.",negative
i received this product free from influenster i liked this moisturizer it is very balmy which i love but not all the ingredients mesh well with my skin personally. depending on your skin type this could be good but the ingredients are not as clean as i would like either.,neutral
i have been a big retinol user for a long time but this is hands down my favorite product. love that it leaves my skin feeling instantly smooth. after about a week it had lessened fine lines giving me a more youthful appearance without leaving me feeling dried out. you can also tell it is an effective formula just by the yellow tint the product has--that is the retinal.,positive
"i love clean beauty products where i can, but this product did not wow me. it is a very moisturizing, thick cream, as it claims to be, but it did not give my skin any sort of special glow or amazing results. the mornings after i apply it i find that my skin is well-moisturized, but not glowy. i would even go as far as to say it makes my skin look matte or dull. for the price, i think that there are far better moisturizers on the market that will moisturize just as well and give you some added benefits. sorry milk, i still love you!",neutral
"it is a nice moisturizer if you have dry skin, too heavy for oil skin unless that is what you want. i have a combination skin type and it worked well at nights, i felt my face hydrated until next day but did not like the oily finish. i have found other moisturizers that also work well for less.",neutral
my skin was clear and fine... days of using this and i look like i need accutane not exaggerating. its been almost months.... years of no acne concerns until now.,negative
"i want to start by saying thanks to olehenriksen for sending me this gel creme absolutely free! so let us get into this review-the packaging is cute, the smell is amazing! i placed a small amount on my face and neck and it felt nice for the most part. kind of felt like a second smoother layer of skin, however it was bit sticky. definitely gave me a nice glow. as the day progressed my t-zone became disgustingly greesy! i was pleased that my cheeks, which are very dry due to the weather, were nice and soft and moisturized, no dry, flakey skin at all! in my opinion this is great for dry skin types but combo or oily skin types should pass!",negative
does not clean that well and the smell is not all that great. i only bought this because they did not have my usual ole henriksen,neutral
"i am so in love with this product! my main concern, besides whether or not it would actually tan my darker complexion, was whether it break my face out? it does not!!! it gives a nice, realistic tan glow! i am naturally a honey brown color think halle berry. will definitely buy again!",positive
after some use of this product i definitely notice some changes in my skin. my bumpy skin feels a lot smoother and my pores as well as some of my lines seemed to have disappear. you definitely need to be consistent with the product but it takes some getting use to since it is a sticky texture upon applying as well as a strong lemony scent. i really liked that it absorbed well into my skin but i could not get over the sticky feeling at first. i am glad i was able to give this a try since my skin is looking a lot better and younger than it has in awhile.,positive
i started using the serum and could see the visible brightness in my skin in days time. results may vary person to person. i simply love how even my blemishes started to reduce slowly gradually.,positive
"i received this product through influenster before it was officially released. i have used it every night for over a week, and i have very dry, sensitive skin. i love this product! it smells nice without being overwhelming, it is pleasant to apply and, most importantly, it has improved the texture and hydration level of my skin without irritating it or causing breakouts. my only complaint is that it is very easy for the two sections to accidentally be mixed together. otherwise a flawless product",positive
i have been using this whenever i have spots pop up and so far it is been helpful calming them down. i do not think alone it gets rid of them but i like using during the day with my bha and at night using retinol every other day.,neutral
i wanted to love this but it ended up having alcohol in it and it honestly did not hydrate my face at all. i used it for a few months and just did not work for me and my super dry skin. i would see it working well for combo skin though,negative
"good effective ingredients, i also like the sachet packaging to keep ingredients fresh the waste not so much but the deal breaker here is the addition of perfume- why would you ruin a good formula by adding perfume which is the most common because of skin condition like rashes and allergies, especially in combination with hydroxy acids which sensitize the skin and allow the perfume to penetrate into skin even deeper? same goes for linalool a plant derived irritating fragrance. and its not a small amount either, my family ran from the room gasping for air when i walked in after application. if that product came form a big chain company it would not surprise me so much, but from a dermatologist i am deeply disappointed and vexed- are selling dimming your medical knowledge and ethics?! the neutralizer is good, although i smell mandelic acid which is not listed on the ingredients. i am a chemist.",neutral
"wow. i mean. just, wow! i could not get my regular facial and microdermabrasion treatments because of the pandemic and was desperate for some exfoliation. that is when i decided to by this toner. this is the first the ordinary product i have tried and am so glad it shattered all of my expectations. my skin texture is even and glowing. amazing!!!",positive
"this stuff is pretty tacky, leaves my skin feeling unclean and honestly smells like bacon or meat or something i do not know.",neutral
"i really wanted to love this mask but unfortunately it did not perform as expected. i have very dry skin and hoped this would revive my skin after a weekend of wedding festivities and late nights. i slept in this mask and when i washed my face the next morning, the mask just slipped off my face. i tried this a few times, only noticing that i developed dry patches on my skin. this was the only new product i would added to my routine in the last few weeks. i also tried leaving it on for just minutes as recommended and then wiping it off, and had no improvement. alas, i returned the mask as it had made my skin ridiculously dry and my skin began to peel.",negative
"used it once and i always realized i do not like it. it sits on top of the skin and has a very thick finish and if you try to apply anything on top of it, like i tried- with serum and moisturizer, everything starts to flake. i also woke up with horrible cystic acne the day after i used it which i do not think is a coincidence.",negative
"uuuuum did i receive the same product that everyone is raving about in all these positive reviews?!? insert side eye so again i had this in my cart to purchase and although there were a lot of positive reviews i was skeptical. i ended up choosing to get this as a sample with my order and i am so glad i did because it definitely would have been returned!this is an average yet abrasive exfoliant that i would not justify paying bucks for. the sample i received i got three uses out of it and it did nothing that it claim to do other than dry my skin out and left my skin looking ashy and dull. it is a pretty rough exfoliant as far as you definitely feel like it is buffing your skin and getting in there, but my skin did not show any improvement or look polished once i washed this off.it reminds me and have similar texture as the youth to the people yerba mate resurfacing exfoliating energy facial with enzymes microdermabrasion treatment. they both have those abrasive micro-exfoliant crystals that really exfoliate the skin, except with this one my skin did not show any improvement and i had to follow up with a hydrating mask.it did not have a scent, it did not break me out or because any irritation, however it did not leave my skin smooth, glowing, or polished. for those reasons i would not purchase or recommend",negative
"honestly this did nothing for my breakouts i am very disappointed. i love the exfolikate facewash and was hoping this would be another great one. i found that this actually worked less than exfolikate in helping my acne. also, it contains sulfur as the main ingredient, so it has an almost rotten egg smell to it that is very unpleasant.",negative
i do not use stuff like this. especially when they have a strong floral scent. i am very sensitive to those scents.,negative
"best face cleanser i have ever used. it just feels so luxurious. in the last ten years i have used so many high end cleansers kate somerville, clinique, skin ceuticals, origins, ole hendrickson, boscia,etc but i always come back to this one. the tube lasts me legit months, using twice a day. you need the tiniest amount like half a pea size and it lathers so much. i have combination skin and i do have acne on my cheeks. in the summer i do get pretty oily. i would say this cleanser makes you feel very clean. not quite stripping your skin but it might be a tad drying for people with super dry skin. the scent is not very strong. my friend used it once when she was over and said it just makes you feel pretty. it is a real treat. yes, it is pricey but you will not be disappointed. buy it!",positive
"i fell in love from the first spray of sweet b!! i gravitate toward natural products so drunk elephant, the product line, has been my go to for awhile now! but i was so amazed by the hydration in my skin the first night i applied the product. i woke up to a dewy and glowing complexion. i have to add... i use sweet b as my last step in my skin care routine before bed and after i apply makeup in the mornings. it is a game changer. especially with the dry, extremely cold winter we are experiencing right now!!! wow just wow!!!",positive
why do brands always take a great formula and ruin it? if it is not broke do not try and fix it. it is sad to see another great product destroyed and loosing sales. highly disappointed and it looks like a ton of other people are as well. thank goodness i still have one of the better original cc creams.,negative
"i thought this product was just ok. i did not really see any results from using this product for a month, but i did appreciate that it was not super heavy or acidic on my normal sensitive skin. i probably would not repurchase again for this price.",neutral
this product claims so many things and delivers none of them. the smell is absolutely putrid and i still smell it after three showers. omg. i cannot stand how i smell and how streaky the product is on my fair and freckled skin. i bought light and it is very orange on me. notnatural as they claim. so disappointed. will be returning this as soon as possible. buyers beware!!!!,negative
why the price increase?! absolutely no reason for it. wonderful product but i go through it way too often to justify paying any more than the original price. unless the formula has changed and the pilling has stopped? now this is at the same price point as the inkey list when in stock which is much easier to apply to skin.,negative
"actually works to reduce my rosacea. i noticed results within week. i have to be faithful to applying twice a day though, or else i notice the redness come back.",positive
"yes its stingy as any good vit c cream, and feels greasy but you only need to apply it overnight and in the morning you will see the benefits, for me its softness and some brighter complexion being a dark skinned female, but gives you a nice glow. i do not use it every night but i like it.",positive
"i absolutely adored this product when i initially used it. i literally sighed out loud the first time because it was so hydrating and had a great texture. however, after about two weeks of use i noticed that i was breaking out all over my face in little white heads- they went away immediately after i stopped using it. i think this product was too heavy for me, even though i have dry skin.",neutral
"this is a good self tanning product but i prefer the isle of paradise self tanning mousse. this product is easy to apply but i have to do it in my bathtubshower because the oil mist will get all over the ground. i also do not love the packaging because after each spray, i have to set it down on its side or put the cap back on for it to stand on its own while i am rubbing in the oil.",neutral
feels great on the skin makes you glow naturally without making you look just oily. i use around to drops with another product also drops its perfect. recommend,positive

"i was excited to try out this vitamin c serum however as soon as i used it, i noticed that the serum smelled like barbecue sauce. i also did not really like the consistency of the serum itself, so i returned it immediately and bought another vitamin c serum instead. overall, nice packaging but i could not get past the smell and consistency.",negative
"you need to experiment with this to make it work. if you wait too long after toner, the serum will just sit on your skin and creates a gummy barrier figure out what sunscreen or moisturizer you can combine this with. i have so many that do not work well together and end up pilling at different degrees and have resorted to only using this when i work from home. it is not worth the hassle for me.",neutral
"i loved it for straight years. it was perfect for my dry acne prone skin- the only cream that felt good, did not because irritation or rush, sit well under make-up, etc. just perfect overall. and then one day i got this formula- i wake up with dry patches on my skin, make up does not stay on and after four day of use i got acne first time since i switched to farmacy years ago. it is just straightforward sad be aware, might cause you acne",negative
"purchased in a full-size set straight from the farmacy website. this moisture mask had the exact opposite effect on my skin. yes, it felt nice warming up on my face as i rubbed it on, but that was the highlight. after rinsing it off, my skin felt tight and dry. and after waiting a minute to see if my skin really had been dried out that badly by it, it was totally clear by the dry patches around my laugh lines area. i would never order this again.",negative
"it is an ok product. i know the ingredients in it are for long term effects, so that is not my concern. it did not break me out or anything, i personally just do not love the consistency or using it. i have switched to the buffet plus copper and i like this wayyy more. i have seen more instant results and the consistency is better. again nothing wrong with the product itself, just more of a preference issue.",neutral
i like the product but the packaging broke after weeks of use. too expensive to have this problem,neutral
"it is hard for me to take away stars from this product because i love the ordinary. i love what they stand for, i love their products, and obviously i love their prices. they are also the only skincare company i have ever seen that offers a one year return policy on their products if purchased from their official site. one year!anyway as for this product, it is a good, basic serum. if you are looking for hyaluronic acid, then here it is. and it does what it is supposed to do. however, some ordinary formulations can be hit or miss when it comes to application and layering. i found that this one does not seem to play well with other products. on its own it is fine, but if i apply anything over top this serum tends to pill. not a big deal for me if using at night, but i prefer hyaluronic acid in my morning skincare. so i cannot recommend this serum for use under makeup or for layering anything on top.honestly hyaluronic acid is found in a lot of skincare products these days so i do not find this serum all that special or necessary, especially compared to other ordinary products. but if you are just looking to add hyaluronic acid to your skin, and you do not care about it pilling, then this one will work. i just think there are better versions so i would not repurchase this.",neutral
"as my acne was finally clearing up after years of breakouts, i bought this products in hopes to get rid of dark spots and have perfectly clear skin. i have been using this for about months now, and barely see a difference it made my skin breakout. totally regret buying this. first picture is a before, second picture is now",negative
"i ordered the medium as that is the self tanner color i usually do and this gives you a glow...an orange glow. it also smells great when applying and stinks a few hours later. i did not see much color for- hours and then only saw that my feet which were pale had turned the horrible fake tan orange. it does come off on your clothes and will make your bed sheets, pillow and mattress cover stink! back to st tropez! huge disappointment. did everything it said it would not.",negative
this product did not get rid of my pimple- instead my skin is now peeling around the zit and it looks like a mark will be left on my face. i do not tend to have sensitive skin but i do not think my skin liked this product at all. it was recommended to me by an employee.,negative
"i am absolutely in love with this anti aging serum!i have had great results with this serum, and i recommend it to anyone over the age of!",positive
loved it initially bought it again and by the end of the second jar i would broken out into cystic acne all over everywhere i had applied it. stopped using it and acne went away.,negative
"i really like this product. i am obsessed with the ice moisturizing cream and was also sent this eye cream to try. i really think it is only a day time appropriate product and therefore, i had to take off a star. i suppose you could use it at night as well, but i just do not really want something shiny at night. this has a luminosity to it that i feel is beautiful under concealer for day time. i love the caffeine and i do feel that it helps to de-puff my undereyes. however, i think also that i would not use caffeine in that area before sleeping. i just see this as a daytime eye treatment, and that is fine by me. however, it could be a bit misleading by the name. it does have wonderful actives like horse chestnut and ginseng!now then, if you are ok with this price point knowing that you will either need a separate eye product at night or use your moisturizer up under your eyes, then absolutely do what works best for you! i personally have not had any issues doing just that, this cream in the morning and my moisturizer or oil around the eyes at night. and by using it only in the morning, i really love the formula and it certainly does aid in depuffing and brightening my eyes. i do not know what is up with all the puffiness all of a sudden, but my gosh am i puffy! i do not really get terrible dark circles, but i have some darkness and undereye wrinkles which i will have to update on if they diminish over the use of this bottle!",positive
does not really do anything for me. its also filled with essential oils that are very sensitizing to the face.,negative

"my friend got these, i tried them. we were both really disappointed. they are an okay moisturizing toner pad, but they are not actually a peel pad. at all. so, at a month, they are just a drastically overpriced toner pad. to be fair, they did not seem to irritate her sensitive skin, though.bottom line hard pass!",negative
wow! i love these! what a great concept...i absolutely love the acne patches so when i received these i was so excited to try them. i saw my forehead wrinkles diminished the next morning after wearing overnight...i wish these came with more in the box because i feel like you have to use these very consistently for continued results...they were non irritating as well...i received this for free in exchange for my honest review form pinchme,positive
"if i could give this negative stars i would. i bought this when it had a few dodgy star reviews so shame on me. this cream is absolutely useless. first off, if has mica in it so it can mask your dark circles instead of actually improving it. i have used this twice a day for the last month and my facial technician and i have noticed deeper lines and darkness around my eyes! when i wake up after a full nights rest, i feel the skin around my eyes are so freaking dry. this has made my skin around my eyes worse than it previously was. my technician has now recommended me to get laser treatment under my eyes to correct it. plus it is so expensive compared to other worthy brands. avoid at all cost. i am tossing mine out.",negative
"i have been super overly-tired lately, waking up with puffy, dark-circled eyes every morning! i had started applying this product regularly a couple of weeks ago and the results have been amazing! after a few hours, my eyes look like they have had the best sleep of their life! i do not have many wrinkles because i am only, but i have definitely noticed my under-eyes have been way more smooth! i highly recommend, though i think an audience with more wrinkles would have even more amazing results!",positive
"i had high hopes for this product- as it would cut two products out of my routine but i am not impressed. here is why you get very little product for the price. the dispenser is not well designed at all. it is slightly gritty at first, but dries fine, almost matte. i feel like i had to use a lot of product to get adequate sun protection. if you feel like the skin tint is oily or too dewy this might be better for you. note, this is very sheer. they need to redesign the dispenser and lower the price and it might be worth it.",negative
"do not think my skin likes chemical sunscreen. i never wear spf which is horrible i know and i thought this would be great since it is such a high amount of spf in a hydrating face moisturizer, that also claims to work well under makeup. while this is very hydrating and gave me a dewy glow, it was very uncomfortable, heavy and made my face itchy. other reviewers said it caused acne which i have not noticed for myself yet but i really do not want to take that chance so this is sadly being returned.",negative
easy to use very little pay off. i really wanted to love this product after receiving it from influenster. the color is amazing and melted into my skin. the bottle however is inconsistent. when you pump very little comes out. though it evens out the skin and leaves a glow the coverage is light. using the product over a few weeks i never noticed a change that would validate the vitamin c benefits. it is a nice product but not worth an investment,neutral
"i have been using this eye cream at night, and not using it during the day as i am trying so hard to not have my mascara leave marks under my oily lids. i cannot speak to it being under makeup except for one day it did not pill, but my concealer still moved into my creases. this cream is a perfectly adequate cream. it is not too heavy, but it is not super light. it does not tug around the eyes, but glides nicely. bonus does not make my eyes sting like some eye creams! i feel, for the price, it is just a tad lackluster if you are wanting anything other than a light moisturizer.",neutral

it is greasy and not easy to blend leaving my face blotchy.,negative
"i have tried so many hydrating products and this jelly serum is one of my favorites. often hydrating serums can be too heavy for my oily skin, but this one was just right. it sinks nicely into my skin and leaves it feeling plump and hydrated, but not oily. i also like that they chose a pump instead of the ever popular glass droppers. my skin literally drinks this product up. i received this product as a free sample, but these are my honest opinions. i highly recommend!",positive
"this product used to be potent and magically made me look amazing the following morning, but not sure what happened to the formula, if they are using cheaper alternatives. this no longer works the way it used to.",negative
"i wanted to love this product after reading so many good reviews about it. i have combinationoily skin and i was expecting good results from this. at first, the oil seemed to help the texture of my face and it felt more smooth. i did at first go through a purge and broke out with one or two zits on my chin and on my forehead places where i normally break out and after weeks of using this product, i saw no changes. the only negative change i saw was that my skin was getting excessively dry and my face was starting to hurt. everyone is skin is different, so i cannot say to swear this off- for me, it did not work.",negative
"i originally bought this to combine my sunscreen and vitamin c step into step. but this sunscreen made my skin greasy and shiny and not in a glowing dewy way. my skin is not naturally oily. the pump is not well designed either. sometimes when i use it, the product squirts everywhere. the liquid comes out looking separated even from the beginning. i like the concept of this product but it is too greasy for my skin.",neutral

"i never write reviews but felt i had to for this product. as others have said, the color is really nice and dark, not orange at all. my issue was this made me break out in a horrible rash on my stomach and other random spots on my body. just beware of this because i did do a patch test before applying over my whole body and it was fine. this has not ever happened to me with any other self tanner. i am really sad because i do not even have sensitive skin and now i have to deal with a eczema-looking rash that makes me feel really self conscious-",negative

"i did receive this free from sunday riley but the views are my honest opinions. i am not a huge fan of the applicator, i normally just squeeze the product onto my finger instead of using the applicator under my eye. that is just a personal preference but besides that it works really nicely. the product is a cute green color and blends into my skin well. pretty light weight. have not had any irritation with it so far. i do not have a lot of fine lines under my eyes, so not sure how well it works, but it is a nice added step in a skincare routine. it does not have any huge scents and did not irritate my under eyes. a bit pricy but i would probably repurchase during a sale.",neutral
"i was gifted by tower beauty for my honest opinions. this serum is definitely not like any others... for all the iffy reasons. i was so excited to try out this serum that would heal and protect my skin and i could not get past the scent of this serum. i was able to use this up for a week until i said no more. this scent is so unique for the wrong reason. once poured into hand a heavy scent of rain jungle water just goes right up your nose and the second you apply this serum it smells like a pool that is been left out in the winter and spring. it is not the best scent. with very little ingredients i can tell most ingredients are water based and i do not know if i got a bad one or what but i cannot stand the smell. second, the spritz on this bottle has got to be one of the worst things in the world. it sprays out like a water gun and it gets everywhere so i suggest not applying it straight to the face. this application bottle is not the best of something like and would have liked to see a pump as the consistency is a watery-gel. it applies just like water and absorbs like water and smells like rain water. i will have to check out of this product and give it to someone who will enjoy it more than i did.",negative
unfortunately this broke me out. i have white heads all over my cheeks and jawline. i have sensitive acne prone combo skin. this is also not the first item in their line that is broken me out. one of their serum did the same. i stopped using both so do not know which one. thought i would be safe w this moisturizer but not the case. then i used their hydra b thinking a light moisturizer would work best and it actually made my skin feel dry all day. i think i am done with this line. going to wait til my acne settles down and going to try biossance.,negative
"works ok, i am not sure how well you can actually control the color. i purchased the lightest color dirst and had no results with drops so went to and got a minor color change, decided to exchange for middle color. i started with drops and now and still no color. i am impressed with the lack of streaking and no orange color at all. but if i have to use drops for each part of my body to get any color this is not very cost effective in my opinion.",positive

received this product complimentary of an influenster voxbox campaign. i really like the packaging that this serum came the presentation it is really eye catcher! the serum looks really beautiful with this blue fulcolor. the serum looks good but once i tried it my face did not really feel hydrate. when it dries up it feels like nothing was applied to the face so for me this is a no! i would not recommend it because it does not fulfills it is purpose.,negative
can be used alone during the summer and with a moisturizer in the winter,positive

"i love this tanner. if you are a self tanner you know that color never lasts on your face. this stuff gives you great color after one application and you do not get that dry feeling you normally do after tanning. the only downside i have is i believe i may have gotten a faulty bottle. after spraying a couple times i noticed it leaks on my hands. also the mist is very weak... i have to get it a inch from my face to make sure i feel it and it is hitting my face. i am buying this one more time now that i have ran out of my first bottle, hopefully i will not have the same experience i had the first time.",neutral
"you can find very similar creams for cheaper. made my skin sting and i did not notice it moisturizing at all, even in the summer. it does dry fairly instantly, but then leaves the skin not feeling hydrated in my opinion. it smells cheap and stings more often than not. i have used the whole jar and will not be repurchasing.",negative
"did not like the texture, not enough beneficial ingredients and most importantly, the product is a glorified sparkly, faint, concealer. why would i want to put this on a clean face before bed? it is almost like kid makeup.",negative
"the product works just fine and i like it. the reason for the stars and the reason i would not buy again is there is no way to wind down the stick once you push it up. there is no way to push it up just a little, then it comes up to much and you cannot get the lid on without smooshing it into the lid. if you try to push it down its just breaks off and its wasted. bummer, i really wanted to love it",neutral
i have used bottles and it definitely helped calm my skin down whenever i was having flare ups and helped out with texture. as for dark spots i believe it did help a bit but i just need something a bit stronger to get the glass skin i desire.,positive
"this is a great substitute for my prescription tretinoin while i am traveling. alternately, if ones skin care needs were modest, one could probably spend years using this retinol without needing to prescribe to tretinoin. it does a better job of keeping my skin barrier intact. highly recommend!",positive
"having dry to normal skin this moisturizer left my skin feeling dry and tight. was not as moisturizing as i would have liked, will be returning unfortunately.",neutral
"absolutely love this product! i had been using a bar of soap to take my makeup off for the longest time was definitely not the best. i tried micellar water, but it just was not working that well for me as i would have to scrub pretty harshly to get off some stubborn mascara. after reading all the great reviews on this cleansing balm, i finally decided to splurge and i wish i had bought it sooner. the most stubborn mascara comes off with just one swipe of this stuff. and a little goes a long way which makes the price seem a bit more reasonable. i will definitely be repurchasing this.",positive
"i thought this was just okay. it is very scrubby and rough which does not seem great for my skin. it is also very fragrant, but all glow recipe products seem to be. it washes off really easily, but i saw that my pores were only smaller immediately after taking off the mask. the results did not last longer than minutes. it is really more of an exfoliant and a very rough one",neutral
"scent is super strong! this cleanser starts as a gel but gets super foamy and left my skin feeling dry. after a few weeks of use i started to get dry patches on my cheeks and chin followed by little pimples. i was recommended this face wash but it just did not work for my sensitive, combination skin!",negative
"this stuff is great! i mix drops with my moisturizer at night and wake up with a nice, tan glow! my only issue is that it is not a long lasting gradual tan say as a sunless tanner that holds color to your skin. i feel like i have to use daily to wake up with color. it may be all the washing of my face as well that strips the color. overall recommend!",positive
"absolutely love this product. although, i am a bit upset that i spent on something that is said to last me awhile then the design of the bottle makes it easy for it to leak and spill everywhere. unfortunately it has wasted about half the product i spent money on.",neutral
love the way it cleans my face i will buy again but it leaves this haze over your eyesight for a few minutes every time i use it.,positive
"i like it, gives me a good glow and really easy to apply! but the smell is too strong at times, just like fragrance. there is still alot of product left by the time the stick rolls up all the way. i probably have to scoop it out and use my fingers to apply which defeats the purpose.",positive
feels absolutely amazing on the skin but my skin was drying more and more every time i would apply it.,neutral
great for sensitive skin. light weight and no fragrance. amazing for the price.,positive
"i purchased this product after i experienced a few breakouts that would not go away. i used as directed once a day at night so i could see if my skin would react negatively to it. after the first night, my acne was almost entirely gone. after the second night, however, i experienced a really bad reaction. my skin was red, swollen, and beginning to peel. i have used products with benzoyl peroxide before and never experienced anything like this. it is been about- days since i had this reaction and my skin is starting to go back to normal but it still feels like sandpaper. fyi- my skin is normal to dry, somewhat sensitive, and prone to breakouts. i am not sure if this reaction was normal, but i would still recommend to someone who does not have dry skin.",neutral
"feels good on the skin and adds a dewy look, but ultimately after using a whole mini-bottle about- months, i have not noticed any change in my skin. my large pores are the same size, it did not help any blemishes, and it was not necessarily any more hydrating than when i just use my moisturizer.",negative
"after hearing so many great things about biossance, i purchased a discovery kit and this cleanser was part of it. unfortunately, i could not get past the rotting seaweed smell to use it more than a few times. worse, the stench lingers. my skin did not overreact or dry out with this cleanser- so that is a positive note. in any case, it is in the recycling bin now.",negative
"i really wanted to like this and have seen so many positive reviews, but unfortunately it did not do anything for me. i gave it two stars because of how lightweight it was and that there was not any fragrance and was not irritating.",negative
"i gave this product a shot because i have heard such great things about what niacinamide can do to improve skin texture and minimize pores, and the price is great! i have not had acne in years and this product made me breakout on my chin almost immediately. might have been because of the zinc but i am not sure exactly why. i stopped and skin went back to normal. i have now tried to use it only on my forehead, nose and cheeks and have not had any issues, so i am happy about that! i have seen an improvement in pore size and texture. so i do recommend this product but if you have sensitive skin, be careful and patch test. not sure if i will purchase this again personally, but it is not a bad a product if your skin can handle.",neutral
"you need to apply so much of this product and still your makeup will not come off. this by far was a waste of money. if you use fenty beauty foundation, i highly do not recommend using this. overall i do not recommend using it. it cannot even remove eyeshadow pigments!",negative
"i purchased this product about days ago and when-i- say! upon placing the product on your hand, you can immediately feel the quality of the product. i add a very small amount of water and rubbed the product on my face and i have no complaints. i appreciate when i invest in quality body care and i can feel and see the positive affects. your face will feel soft as cashmere. i pair this with the olhenriksen facial oil and i am in love!!!!!",positive
"i bought this at ulta about two months ago now. i use it everyday, but it really just has not done a thing for my skin.i was interested in this because my skin has been a bit dry now that i am back in an air conditioned office. the rest of my skincare routine, with each addition, has always benefitted my skin. i really like the ordinary, i use their niacinimide, their squalene, their retinol, their cleanser, all of those are great. this just really does not do anything though. i always spray my face with water before and after, but still no difference. i am glad it was cheap, so i did not waste a lot of money, but after months i am giving up on it.at least i did not have any adverse effects, that is a good side.",negative
"love the texture of this cream, it settles into the skin nicely. the smell is quite off putting, which is why i took away some stars. that said, i would consider buying again. would like to test out some more gel creams first.",neutral
been using consistently at night and my pores are definitely less noticeable. i use just where i have enlarged pores. too oily for day time for me but does not dry me out either. will repurchase,positive
really love this one. melts into skin so nice and works well with my vitamin c in the day. definitely will keep this one as a staple in my vanity,positive
"takes off my makeup and skincare well without leaving residue or breaking me out. it does not take off waterproof mascara which is annoying and the formula clouds my eyes like crazy. this is a good cleansing balm, but i have tried better for less than half the price.",neutral
moisturizing and soothing for sensitive skin. removed makeup without irritating rosacea.,positive
"i will come edit my review after i have been testing it long enough. if you are sensitive to smells, be careful of this one- it does not have a floral scent, or sweet scent, or even an herbal scent. no. it smells like dirty underwear.",negative
i really wanted to try estee lauder because i heard so many good things about it. this was in a hydrated set that i purchased. this along with the night wear plus broke my skin out and my skin is still recovering.,negative
made my skin very glowy and hydrated but caused me to break out.,negative
"i have been using it for a few weeks. i like it but do not love it. it cleans but is kind of thin so i do not feel like it is doing much. i also do not like the smell- it is very strong. finally, i do not feel it is as moisturizing as it claims. overall i would not purchase but i appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients and the price point.",neutral
"okay so despite the packaging, i did not realize this product would contain and smell like flowers. the strong rosy smell instantly kicked off my allergies. i had to return. i do not recommend for sensitive skin.",neutral
"i am so amazed by this product! i had dermatitis and within two days my skin went from being rough, dry and flaky to smooth, plump and soft. the price is excellent, and i was surprised that a product this amazing could be so inexpensive. overall, a product. i will be buying again as soon as i run out.",positive
"it is good for the face! it does not make me breakout, it feels nice on the skin, smell is not super strong, not overly orange on me so long as i do not use much! would not recommend it for all over the body, it is pretty unpredictable and hard to get even when applied everywhere. while i love that you can mix it with your fav lotion, i do wish that they gave you more guidance on that because i have found some lotions work a lot better than others if they could recommend a specific kind of lotion i would love to see it.",neutral
this took a lot of product to get my makeup off and i had to rub my eyes pretty hard to get off my eye makeup. i threw out my point perk size of this after one use. not good compared to other oil cleansers like the tarte deep dive cleasing gel.,negative
"this is a really good serum, but it is not worth the price unless you are willing to pay. they have others out there that are great. it did not do much for my skin at all!",neutral
"not a good micellar water!! would not recommend if you are seeking water-like micellar water. i do not feel this product cleans well when comparing to other micellar water i used before eg. garnier, laroche posay, bioderma. would not recommend this product. i have to use more cotton pads when i am using this micellar water when compared to when i use other brands.",negative
"i have used so many different products with vitamin c claiming to remove dark spots and help with discoloration. i have acne scarring and nothing could seem to help. i gave this serum a try and was very surprised at the results, not only is it hydrating due to the argan oil it is non greasy and has no stickiness to it. my biggest issue when using serums is that they leave a sticky residue. this serum however feels silky and smooth and my skin already looks brighter and even some of my discoloration is gone. this is an amazing serum a must try. i have been using this one as well as the resurfacing together and love love the results.",positive
i wanted to like this but it did nothing but make my skin irritated and red.,negative
"loving using this product as a night cream. my skin is always dry during the winter season no matter how much moisturizer i apply and most of the day i end up looking like a greaseball. but this cream has saved me from that. i love how truly moisturized it makes me skin feel and love using this at night time. it gives my skin the hydration it needs throughout the night and i wake up with healthy, hydrated skin in the morning. this has become a staple in my skincare routine especially for winter time.",positive
"i have a combination skin and this serum works with my skin type. i love that it absorbs quickly and is plant based. it gives instant hydration but i do not notice any plumping. though i use it under another moisturizer, it works for me that way. the price is a little high for this product.",neutral
"i bought this because some of the reviews said it might work for breakouts but it did not work for me. leaves your skin soft after using but the beads in it are not rough enough to really exfoliate, especially for dry skin. bar melts no matter where you keep it. i can see how someone with different skin may like this bar but it was not for me. it was good for use after shaving my legs but for the price not worth it.",neutral
i originally received this product as a sample and after one use my skin felt noticeably cleaner. after using for about a week all of my acne that i have struggled with for years has cleared up and my skin looks naturally glowing but not oily. this product does not dry out my skin and also smells so good.,positive
"it is really hydrating but it takes a while to soak in. it almost feels like a thick oil or cleansing balm type consistency but in a stick so it does not immediately absorb. other than that, i have not noticed a hide difference but i also do not usually have puffy eyes or many wrinkles yet. i do really like some of the ingredients, but it is a bit pricey for my needs. plus, the stick pulls a bit at the skin which i do not love either.",neutral
"way too much fragrance!! it is a nice product but not at this price, so many better options",negative
it is an ok product pricey for a small amount and has a weird smell.,negative
"this is an okay product. i noticed a little difference in my skin- softer overall and a little brighter.i hate the smell. it is light when wearing, but i do not like how it feels.if you are looking to soften your skin and have brighter skin, give this a try. keep in mind it does have a smell but that goes away after a short period of time.i am not sure i would buy it as i really dislike the scent and how it feels on my face. the pros are the softer skin and brighter skin though.i would recommend if you are looking for softer, brighter skin and can get past the smell for a short period of time,",neutral
will permanently stain your sheetspillowcases yellow.,negative
"i have used many eye creams before but with this one, i felt instant relief from my tired, dull eyes! working from home has caused a strain on my eyes, which also includes dark and puffy eye bags. i like this serum because it is very light, yet absorbs well and quickly after applying. i was expecting a fruity guava smell, but i seem to like it better unscented, as it comes! the cherry on top is the bottle it comes in because it is so unique and cute!",positive
skin looked so much brighter after this!but i would get cystic pimples here and there from this. i usually do not get them and my skin is dry. such a shame...,negative
"i am half way through using this product. i got a set of the serum, face wash and toner from this line off of the caudalie website. using the three together really made me start to breakout and i think that it might have just been too aggressive for my skin. i stopped using the face wash and toner and stuck with this serum and my breakouts are less. i still have small pimples that come up on my skin, not too sure if this serum is causing it or not but overall my skin has improved in the month that i have been using this. iam washing my face with the caudalie foaming face wash and anyone with sensitive skin it is nice, makes my skin soft and dosent really irritate. the caudalie products however are not totally natural, and though they do have some good ingredients in them there are bad ones as well so just do your research. i give this stars because i do feel that my skin is better since using this but i am not sure if i will buy this again, i will probably try to find something else with ahas in it to help my pores and texture. does it help pores? not that i have noticed. does it regulate oil, a little yes. my acne has subsided a bit so the salicylic acid does do that.",neutral
"a m a z i n g.after this mist, my skin is so balanced and soft.totally need it before i put the serum and moisturizer.",positive
"usually love murad but this is not the best product. way overpriced for the amount of product you get and the lack of results. i will be sticking to paulas choice of retinol, which is my go-to.",neutral
i bought this after the birthday set last year. at the time my skin reacted very well to it. after buying the full size i notice how dried out my skin became? even when pairing it with the protini face cream. i now only use this when i am removing light makeup at the end of the day instead of using it as a cleanser on my bare skin and i like it for that purpose. but not enough to repurchase. if you have dehydrated andor dry skin avoid this!,neutral
not as good as benefiance wrinkleresist intensive eye contour cream and more expensive.,negative
"i gave this a try on my puffy, tired undereyes and it did absolutely nothing that a moisturizer from walmart would do. it says it is for dark circles, which i do not have, so it is clearly for undereyes too. i saw absolutely zero change in my mild undereye post-weekend puffiness. i get better results from my clinique all about eyes. the glowing reviews on this make me question the validity of future reviews i read unfortunately, and that is disheartening",negative

"i got a deluxe sample size of this item a few years ago and really liked it. i wanted to buy the full size but just did not want to spend at the time. once sephora got the brand, i was excited and planned to get it during one of their sales, however... this specific item took a while to come over to sephora. well anyways it is finally here, hooray! i have tried numerous acids and retinoids and what have you, and this one is my favorite. my skin is quite normal slightly oily t zone in the summer, slightly dry cheeks and forehead in the winter, and i do have early signs of aging showing some fine lines, one bad sun damage spot, and this stuff just makes my skin glow when i wake up in the morning. it is crazy!! you also get a decently sized bottle for the amount of times you actually use the product i think- times a week is what is recommended, but start with maybe- days a week. it is worth the price and is super underrated!",positive
i did not see any difference. other serums have bigger impact on fine wrinkles. it fells like you pay for the container more then the product. will not buy again,negative
not worth the money. never noticed a change in my skin. skip it.,negative
"i received this from influenster for my honest opinion. i was super excited about this product, but even the directions were confusing. apply to eye contour i do not know where that is on my face! but i applied it around my eyes and no difference. i had hoped for them to seem brighter, tighter, or just a bit more moisturized, but i did not notice a change.",negative
do not loose time nor money. worst product ever. it broke in three different parts after only a month,negative
"i was extremely excited when influenster sent me this to try. it is moisturizing and my skin felt smooth, but i saw no actual improvement to my skin, and i did end up with a few areas of milia. the packaging is lovely and it feels luxurious, but i just cannot justify the price for this.",neutral

i have been using this for weeks. no great difference noticable,negative
"i was new to exfoliating acids and read such great reviews of this product so i decided to try it out. i wanted to see if it would make my large pores on my nose appear smaller, take care of blackheads, and help with my overall skin tone. i have combination skin- oily t zone, drier by mouthjawline- and do not usually have major acne breakouts. i do consider my skin sensitive though because i notice that at times i will turn red or dry when using certain products too much. when i first started using this, it did not burn off my face, and it actually did make a difference in the appearance of my pores on my nose. they were noticeably smaller. however, around probably the nd week of using this product i noticed that i was breaking out a lot on my chin, which never happens. after doing more research online, it said sometimes people breakout for a few weeks like a purging cycle, so i continued to use it. unfortunately, the breakouts on my chin have not gone away and have gotten worse. i read online that if you are still breaking out after- weeks of use then maybe it is not the right product for your skin. unfortunately, i think it just did not work out for my skin.",neutral
i tried two samples of this and applied morning and night. i found my skin around my eye was very dry. i even added an additional moisturizer and still found in the morning my eyes seamed very dry and crusty.,negative

this eye serum is ultra smooth in both texture and application. i love how hydrating it is due to the hyaluronic acid. it is ultra gentle and effective. i love it.,positive

i have been using this product for almost two months and a girl who works at my local sephora recommended this. i really wanted to love this product but it just did not work for me. it irritated my skin and made me break out! i have dry skin and prone to acne. i still have more than half of the product and i cannot return it to sephora which is a bummer. i do love the smell of this product though.,negative
meh. got the same results from the dollar neutrogena pads. for almost bucks i would no rebuy.,neutral

i wanted to love this so so badly.... put it on before bed and woke up with red irritated blotches all over my face... returned the next day...,negative

unfortunately on my skin i did not see a difference while using this product. i used it for about weeks and was especially excited to see any change in dryness and brightness but did not see any improvement. i also wish the serum was more easy to apply evenly on the face.,negative
"has a much stronger scent than i was expecting, smells kind of like lemon lime candy. was hoping it would be more subtle or natural smelling so was kind of put off by that immediately.",neutral
"i was so excited to get this after reading the reviews, but it did not last. it is super thick going on, like most zinc sunscreens, but then it just sat there. instead of fading to a nice beige it kind of changed from pale green to pale white. i am a very fair person and i still looked like i had anemia. to add insult to injury i got a big spattering of whiteheads after using it. i love the black dr. jart bb cream so i had big hopes for this one, but it now has the distinction of being the very first product i have ever returned at sephora and i have been shopping here a loooong long time.",negative
the main reason i bought this was for the smell. living in a colder climate i feel like it falls a little short keeping my skin moisturized. i still like it but not sure i will buy it again.,neutral
"i love that sephora is now selling cleaner brands of skincare!! i really wanted to love this product for what it claims to do, reduce redness, but i did not. i found it was a great overnight moisturizer but it did not do a lot for my redness. i wanted to make sure i tested it for a few weeks before giving my review and i did not see a difference when using it consistently. i do love the cleanser i used and thought the two paired well together. it did keep my skin supple and moisturized overnight which can be tough for me! i received this product from influenster. all opinions are my own.",neutral
"i really wanted to like this. i bought it to try and even out some acne scarring and keep my pores clear without drying my skin out. while my skin did not feel dry, i did not notice any difference at all. it also felt very sticky. my skin did not feel clean after using it, felt like i needed to wash my face after applying.",negative
"i have been using this product for about a year now and while it does not because redness or irritation, i am just not sure if it is doing anything else. it has not minimized any fine lines and it does not seem to tone my skin. i use it every night, so i expected more obvious results especially when paired with the moisturizer, which i use once or twice a week. i think you are paying for the brand on this one more than anything.",neutral
my expectations were to high from this product! i have oily skin and i thought this would be holy grail but it is just ok...makes my skin oily after a while,neutral
if you are smell sensitive this is not for you. i had to wash it off my face. the odor was offensive to me,negative
"as a cleanser, it left my skin squeaky clean and feeling very tight. i have oily skin so i usually do not mind a harsher cleanser, but this was even too much for me. however, it did leave my skin perfectly clean.as a leave on mask, it did absolutely nothing.",negative
absolutely awful packaging!! cheap plastic packaging that broke and the cap is janky as well! for you would think that would not happen! the product just sits on top of my skin as well! does not soak in leaving you looking very greasy... would not recommend,negative

i have very dry and sensitive skin so i am always picky with products. i received this as a sample and now i cannot wait to purchase. this makes my skin feel alive again! my face feels great when i have this product on. i use a thin layer and that does it for me. my face has not look this alive in forever.,positive
"i do not hate this product, but i do not love it either. i love biossance as a brand but this toner just was not anything amazing for me. it feels nice on the skin and is pretty hydrating, but i do not feel that it had done anything to either clear my skin or affect the appearance of my pores in the two months that i was using it. while biossance is one of my favorite brands, i do not feel that their acne-targeting products are as good as other brands. if you are looking for bha with better results, i really recommend paulas choice liquid exfoliant or the ordinarys salicylic acid mask.",neutral
"i have oily combination skin and i like this hydrator because it is very lightweight. my skin loves it. my skin remains hydrated throughout the day without producing excess oil. it sits well under makeup as well. definitely recommended for oily, combo skin type!quality does not have to be expensive. this hydrator is vegan and clean at sephora.",positive
absolutely love the product. it starts with a oil based cleanser that easily removes all the makeup. because it is oil based it removes spf from the pores.....best part when you put water on it it changes its consistency completely and does not leave your skin greasy at all.,positive
this product seems to sit on top of my face. it causes me to sweat profusely. i am not impressed.,negative
i have used it for months now and do not really notice any difference. i am also not a fan of the sticky and shiny finish it has on my face. will prob finish the bottle since it is so expensive but would not purchase again.,negative

"i received this product complimentary from influenster, but i have to admit this is not my favorite product. it applies nicely, but it feels very heavy and sticky once it dries. i get that it is a face mask, and not a moisturizer but it just sits on top of the skin without absorbing. i have to apply a really thin layer in order for it not to feel greasy or sticky. i much prefer the laneige sleeping mask that came in the sephora birthday box.",neutral
i have been using this for awhile now. it did not break me out at all and i do have sensitive skin. it worked well on my shoulders and back. i probably will not repurchase though. i was not wowed by it...,neutral

product is nice enough. i like the tint and consistency of the sunscreen. deducted stars on poor packaging. it is messy out of the bottle and label has flaked off. i use other tacha products and this is the first one that i have to constantly clean the bottle.,neutral
i received this sample courtesy of influenster. i would say it is just ok. it made my skin soft at night but not much else. a little definitely goes a long way though!,neutral
"an amazing product, hydrates, soothes, calms the skin, but ren does it again with fragrance that why i took a star off. you cannot claim to be clean but have fragrance in products. its and no one wants fragrance anymore, its bad for your face!!!",positive
"so basically i ended up using the entire bottle over the span of just over months, constantly made sure i had it on day and night cuz i really wanted my dark circle to fade. sad to say it did nothing for my dark circles. it was amazingly hydrating and weightless but unfortunately it did not work for my main concern which was dark circles.",neutral
"i received the mini size of this with a set, and i loved it. it makes my face feel so hydrated and happy. i have justified paying the price for this as it does such a great job on my skin.",positive
"i received this product from influenster, but was genuinely baffled by my results after using it for weeks. my under eyes tend to be quite dark and dry, so i have been on the hunt for a good eye cream that would allow me to give my concealer a break every now and then, and was pleasantly surprised when i tested this baby out. i genuinely noticed that my under eyes were brighter and my skin was firmer so less concealer creases. would definitely recommend it. i also love the texture, but could do without the fragrance! especially because the undereye area is so sensitive already.",positive
received as a sample size and used a few times. i have used many products in the same category with better results and this peel smells exactly like nail polish remover. it makes me feel like i am just putting alcohol all over my face.,negative
"dried out my skin and after long term use it made parts of my checks get red,hard,itchy,dry and a bunch of little bumps appeared.",negative
"used this about three times now, and it definitely delivers on smoothing texture and exfoliating away dull skin. my skin feels soft and extremely refreshed after this. i do not feel like i see an immediate brightening effect, but possibly in the long run with how well this sloughs off dead skin.it does have a decent sting for the first- minutes, not so much painful but it feels itchy and annoying until it calms. the first time i totally did not use enough product, feeling no tingle whatsoever. i use about pumps for my whole face two for each side and one for my forehead. i also find it helpful to use a silicone mask spatula for easy application and less waste. i only use it when my skin feels seriously congested so not too concerned about running out quickly.and you absolutely need to replenish your skin well after this. the oil sample that comes with this is not a suggestion, it is required. i apply two or three moisturizers to help soothe my skin and calm any redness from the high acid content. i have sensitive skin and while it definitely does mildly react to this, it dissipates quickly and my skin is markedly better than before i use the mask.i like this for its quick exfoliating benefits and i am curious to see how it tackles my acne scars and if any brightness sticks around to decide if i will repurchase.",positive
"i do not recommend this product to sensitive skin. i did not purchase this product, but she gave me some sample, after i used minutes my face was so sensitive to it. it started getting itchy and red!!! i am super sensitive skin, i am glad i did not get it.",negative
"i love the actual product itself, i have been able to tell a difference in the way my skin looks brighter and more clear since i started using it. when i first initially started using this the smell was very odd to me but since i have been using for a couple months now i do not notice a smell when putting on my face. i saw the reviews saying people were having trouble with the actual packaging i am very careful with all my stuff so i thought it possibly could be the way people were handling the bottle. but one morning i went to use this and the bottle would not pump at all. i had to put the product completely out of the actual bottle and now just have the inside part. lucky the pump has still been working but still frustrating to pay so much for a product and have the bottle break not ever halfway through the product. i hope they fix the packaging since i love the product so much.",neutral
"i am giving stars because it seems to be doing a good job for what it is intended to do. but the smell is so much! i am not one to complain about fragrance in anything but i could hardly fall asleep after using it an hour before bed time. the smell was just all around me, on my pillow. for this reason i will be returning it to find something with similar good effects but less or no scent.",neutral
"i got the mini and it is very mini, but it works well enough and so far has not broken. i keep it in the fridge and it feels great on my skin. when i use it in the morning, i can actually tell a difference in my face puffiness after using it.",positive
"this cleanser does not rinse well, and makes me break out. many of the other reviewers have commented this as well. hope sephora is not removing less favourable reviews. its rather expensive for what it is",negative
"not really sure what the hype is all about. this is a physical exfoliator and despite warming it up in my hands, i still have little hard clumps that scratch my skin. leaves my skin feeling red and painful after each use.",negative
"i purchased this to replace my tatcha spf and i wish i had not done that. it is a good sunscreen and i like that its a higher spf but i do not like the feel of the silicone and when i touch my face, the product transfers onto my hands. it has an unscented scent that is not horrible but also not great. i will finish this product and find something else.",neutral
"maybe it works but the perfume triggers an allergy response so it is super hard for me to use it. if fragrance bothers you, skip this product. i will not re-order",neutral
during the winter my moisture barrier was damaged so after doing some research i decided to give this wash a try. it did not disappoint! i have very oily skin and this was the perfect cleanser that left my skin feeling clean without drying it. other creamy cleansers tend to make me still feel greasy.,positive
not at all happy with the results. it makes my face looks dull. not worth the money. i would not recommend this product.,negative
"for the price point, it is not a bad product, but i am very underwhelmed by it. the cold tip does get clogged with product, which makes it difficult to use as an applicator. i end up using my fingers similar to what other users said. the brightening effect is there and the product itself has not had any negative side effects for my skin, but i am just not sure its really doing anything besides acting as a cover up or highlighter for under eye circles when i do not want to wear makeup. you also have to let it dry before applying anything over it otherwise the product pils a little bit.",neutral
overpriced garbage please do not waste your money. gross and disgusting.,negative
it makes my face dewy yes...but also feels like straight oil coming out. it does not seem to clog my pores but only time will tell. just a meh product for me.,neutral
"the changed the packaging, instead of wood it is all plastic, major bummer. product is nice but nothing i cannot get from vaseline or aquaphor.",neutral
"this has become my go to foundation, a little goes a long way. i really like that it does not melt in the heat. i do not like how it looks when i use a foundation brush, i actually prefer the look with i use my fingers for application.",positive
"smells soooo good and i wanted to love it. my skin is not typically prone to breaking out from oil, pretty much ever, however this stuff totally clogged my pores and broke me out. now i use it in my hair instead.",negative
"as a girl who likes to pour money into skincare product, i was interested to see the effectiveness of this moisturizer. before i start off with the moisturizer itself, i want to take a moment to compliment the design of this bottle- it is very luxurious feeling and makes your skincare lineup look very fancy. moving onto the moisturizer, i was initially in love with it, but my skin was not. i have sensitive skin, and my body loves to react angrily whenever i put on something that does not agree with me. the lancome-iconic fragrance, this time rose, was not friendly to my sensitive skin. the texture and finish of the moisturizer is very light and leaves a dewy look on the skin, but it was just that. maybe it was because of its lightness, but my skin never felt the hydration that i have experienced with some other brands. and as someone who lives in a polluted urban environment, i need hydration to keep my skin afloat. overall, i would recommend this product to someone who does not have my skin issues, most likely an oily-normal skin type, as they may find this product to be just what they need in their lives.",negative
"i used this stuff religiously for over a year and i did not really notice much of a difference to my face. i wanted to believe the hype but other than feeling like a decent moisturizer, it was dissapointing for the price.",neutral
"i have massive pores that tend to get clogged and congested, resulting in closed comedones and this serum is a miracle worker! my pores are barely noticeable, my oil is controlled, and my skin barrier looks and feels super healthy. i do not get tons of acne when i use this product, and my makeup application looks a thousand times better because of how much it minimizes pores. i did not realize how important a serum could be in terms of making my makeup last and look it is best. this serum ensures that i am working with a smooth, poreless canvas. definitely a permanent staple for me!",positive
"this is what i have been looking for from a toner my whole life. it is not drying, harsh or overly stripping, but my pores are gone after it is applied. if you are looking for powerless glass skin, this is it. i would say this is a holy grail, god level skincare hero, and if you want your selfies to be poreless without a filter, this is your product.",positive
"i really love trying new moisturizers. i have normal to dry skin, drier especially during the summer and winter months. i really love creams that are thicker in consistency. this cream has a great consistency however i found it left a bit of a sticky residue feeling on my skin. it definitely left my skin feeling soft and supple which is great, i just did not like way it felt post application. i also found the scent a bit too strong.",neutral
it is ok i love how it dispenses but it is a too little perfumey for me and kind of greasy feeling.,neutral
"i like all other the ordinary products i have tried, but this is a miss for me. this worked a little for the dark circles under my eyes, but i had to stop using it. it made my under-eye skin very dry, which was agitating and did not improve the appearance of fine lines. if your skin is not dry at all under your eyes, this might work for you. however, this product is not very useable for me personally.",neutral
just received this about a week and a half ago and so far i am loving it. it does not feel sticky or anything and instantly my skin feels so nice and smooth. overall the texture on my skin has gotten a lot better. would definitely recommend!,positive
highly fragrant and irritated my skin. started having weird breakouts on my cheek and forehead. if you are sensitive to fragrance then be mindful of that.,negative
"if you wear waterproof mascara, it will not come off. it does a good job on removing the rest of my makeup, but i do not see anything life changing. i will use up this bottle and not purchase it again.",neutral
this cream was not the best for my skin. it was a little too thick but i have to say the packaging on this is top notch. no possible contamination and the product will last longer since it is less exposed to air. if you have normal skin i think this will work and for some combo skin. smell was fine but it just felt like it never sunk into my skin.,neutral
loving this eye cream! i apply before bed and wake up with my eyes looking brighter. i usually have some dark circles but they appear significantly less dark now. really great product if you are looking for something to help with that! i also love the guava.,positive
this is not a bad product but i like the old formula better. if you apply this without wetting your face first it can dry out your skin. that is what happened to me before i learned hyaluronic acid should be put on wet skin. i honestly do not think it needs to be in the formula the old formula worked much better it felt like it gave my skin everything it needed this new formula does not seem to add anything. i bought the cream that goes with this and it is very heavy. i also like the old formula of that better as well.,negative
i tried this product after i saw on tik tok and mentioned it was amazing. i have been using this product for about ish months. i have seen nothing different in my under eye.,negative
"so far, so good. just started using this so too early to judge it is efficacy but texture is good and a little goes a long way.",positive
"if you are sensitive to coconut oil please do not buy! it did lighten old hyperpigmentation but gave me the gift of new pimples! the smell is bad but it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, it disappears pretty quickly. looks like i am in the minority because it seems to work well for most however, just beware.",negative
"my skin type is combination but more on the dry side. so using this product has kept me hydrated! it smells good, not too strong though! thank goodness it is kept me moisturized for this winter and plus points because i have sensitive skin and it did not affect me!",positive
"creamy, exfoliating and foaming! what else do you need? does not strip your skin even after numerous face washes, it was so nice that i could not help but wash my face repeatably a few times first time using this admit it yah all do it but please do not this did not strip my skin and left it instead wonderfully soft and cleansed! i am buying a second one just to have it in the downstairs and the upstairs washrooms.",positive
"when i saw this in the latest luxe box i figured it was my opportunity to try it, to see what all the fuss is about. while writing this review i have had it days. it is a very heavy cream and the directions advise not to rub in, but to pat and press into skin. the special instructions did make using it feel fancy for lack of a better word. i used it only at night but there is no way i could apply primer, sunscreen and makeup over this heavy cream. believe me, i tried and it was a fail in deg heat when i woke in the morning, my face was smooth and glowy and baby soft. i loved it as a nighttime cream and i believe it did it is job as a moisturizer. here is the thing. it is not good. i have used other moisturizers that are hgs for me. do not get me wrong, i will use the heck out of a free sample. it just was not impressive enough to get me on the lamer bandwagon.",neutral
"too greasy and does not soaked in,",negative
"such a great toner. helps me keep my skin nice and clean and refreshing, getting rid of that extra makeup and dirt from the day that the remover missed, without excessively stripping my skin from its natural oils. i received this product as a complimentary gift from influenster.",positive
"really wanted to love this. the color was beautiful but despite exfoliating and moisturizing, it kept coming out splotchy.",negative
did not help my acne or redness at all. i did not even see a slight difference.,negative
this product is so hard to put on. it starts out okay but by the first few pats it is impossible to spread and tugs on my eye area. not really what i want in an eye cream. and did not really get any amazing results.,negative
i really liked the keihls powerful-strength dark circle reducing vitamin c eye serum. it is super hydrating. i have noticed reduced fine lines and slightly reduced dark circles. i am hopeful that with continued use i will see the results i am looking for.,positive
"this product was gifted to me complimentary by octly for my fair and honest review. this product is intended to be used once a week, and i have used it twice. the mitt provided has plenty of the product on it, and one side is sort of rough and helps exfoliate the skin. the product is really gentle on my skin, and while it does dry tacky, i did not find that to be distracting. i woke up with noticeably softer, smoother skin. it feels like a really good exfoliation. however, that does not seem to last more then a day or so, by days after the treatment my skin feels about the same as it did before.i do not think this is a good value for the money. i have had similar results with much, much cheaper products.",neutral
"i really love how nourishing this cream is for my skin! i have combination skin and it strikes a perfect balance without ever feeling excessive. i just wish the fragrance was not as strong. also, as with other fresh creams, jar packaging exposes product to air...not sure why they are keeping it that way.",positive
"i cannot find another way to describe how my skin feels like after using this. just soft, smooth, and glowy without looking shiny or oily. my dermatologist actually recommended me this when i told her i liked luxury products! i have acne-prone skin that tends to get either too dry or too oily easily so i use this after my niacinamide serum and it feels like a dream.",positive
"paula choice c boosterthis vitamin serum is quite active at and nd ingredient on the inci list. so it makes this formula quite potent but it does not irritate my skin. this serum really does it is job, left my skin brighter and more even tone. giving me a glow from the inside. the texture is on the watery side so i would have preferred this in a pump form. i have not notice changes in fine lines and wrinkles that would take a tad longer for me to tell.",positive
"i have come across this product in the store many times and finally broke down and bought it to try after hearing so many amazing things about it. i tried the sample i received a few times before i opened the product and there was nothing remarkable to this mask. first of all, it has a peppermint scent to it so if that bothers your sensitive skin i would be cautious trying it, it did not seem to irritate mine but it was noticeable. second, i tried it overnight and with a thicker layer as a mask and i did not notice a difference in my hydration level, tone, or texture. the texture is also a cream like consistency and almost made my skins pasty and dull looking. wanted to love it but i did not so it went back.",negative
"this product is unique! i have never used a powder exfoliator it worked well on my sensitive skin. i am so glad it did not strip my skin dry can be used daily! i wanted to love this item with stars but i have one con it is sloppy and can be a bit messy rubbing it onto your face. the texture feels weird but other than that it does it is job. my face felt fresh, softer and smoother just after first time use.",positive
"i just bought this and it works well. i only give it stars because i have not idea if what i bought actually corresponds to the real product adversities. it has no smell. it does not have the same ingredients not at all!!! listed on product as advertised on website. very disappointed. ingredients are water, butylene glycol, caprate, squalene, alcohol, tg, hydrogenated oil, triheptanoin, grape seed oil, etc... without any of the website ingredients or the order listed.",neutral
"not my grail. looks pretty but i cannot stand the smell. i have combination skin, the texture of the product is definitely on the thick heavy side. package is also not an good idea to fill liquid product inside. pump bottle might be better for this product.",negative
product is extremely greasy and left me with tons of breakouts. would not recommend.,negative
"dude, not to be dramatic, but i think this is the best face mask i have ever tried. i have normal to dry, extremely sensitive skin. my face rarely reacts positively to a product, but when i woke up in the morning my skin felt hydrated, smooth, and all around healthy. it was fun to use and smells amazing. would highly recommend!",positive
i wish i could give this more stars but i just did not see the results i hoped for the price this costs. i know that everyone is skin responds to different products based on their specific issues. i am not saying this will not work for some but it has helped very little with my skin problems. i have very dry skin on my forehead and large pores on my cheeks and this has diminished those by about percent after weeks of twice a day use.,neutral
"super freaking good omg. literally deletes texture in the skin, and only need a pea size amount!",positive
"i am already finishing the second tube in less that year and alli can say i am addicted to it. ofteni would use it even during day, as part of my skin regimen replacing my hidrating cream... it goes great under makeup. i tinny bit goes well in a summer day, making my skin plump and fresh. i absolutely love it. will buy again and again.",positive
"i love this peeling solution, it helped with my pores, blackheads, and skin texture! i really do recommend this product for acne-prone skin and oily-prone, i have oily prone and this is perfect for my skin!",positive
"i have tried probably close to different cleansers in my lifetime. this one was a winner. it is a little pricey, but small amounts go a long way with foaming cleansers. i am one of those people that do not quite feel clean if the cleanser is too gentle or slippery. i liked this product for how clean it made my face feel. some might say it is too stripping, though.",positive
"i wanted to love this, as i have other supergoop products in the past like their unseen version, however this one missed the mark for me. i was hoping this sunscreen would leave my skin with a realistic glow, however i find that it looks more like a sheer liquid highlighter put all over your faceneck when applied generously using the recommend amount of sunscreen vs. looking like you have a healthy glow. this one also pilleddid not mix well with my skincare products, and the shade golden hour was a bit too pigmented shimmery for my dryfair-skinned face. i could see this looking better on a more tanned complexion andor on those who are seeking an all-over highlight look.",neutral
i love this cleanser... and then they changed the formula on us you all! added fragrance to it with a ton of other new ingredients! so so so freaking mad!,negative
"i absolutely love this toner. it leaves my skin feeling so soft, there is no need to use an exfoliating scrub or anything anymore. the only downside is the size, i am going through it so fast using it twice a day. plus it is almost always out of stock. they really need to come out with a bigger size especially for a toner!",positive
please bring back the foaming cleanser! after two washes this cleanser does not completely remove my concealerpowder at the end of the day. it leaves a film on my skin and my face does not feel clean. after a few days of using it i broke out and will be returning it.,negative
"like a lot of the comments have mentioned, this product can be a hit or miss for oilycombo skin. my skin is oily though leaning more combonormal these days after consistent skincare routine. at first i used this product as a hydrator and moisturizer, then placed an oil as a sealant on top and my skin hated this routine. the layers were too much and i woke up with clogged pores. now i use it as a moisturizerfinal step at night when i use a product with retinol in it to avoid drying out my skin and it helps! i really only use it about-x a week and my skin is always soft after applying it and when i wake up.",positive
"i had read and heard so much about this cream that i was eager to try it. what no one mentions is that this lotion, though it is supposed to be unscented, actually smells like a wet towel that has become moldy. it feels hydratingly creamy but the smell is unbearable. i cannot even think about putting this near my face though i think it may be too thick for that anyway. just wanted to add my dissenting view.",negative
"tried leaving a review for this at the el website but it never posted. if anyone remembers the now discontinued el fruition, this smells just like fruition! i really liked fruition and i really like this product. it makes the skin feellook so soft and smooth. i have not used it long enough to see significant long term results but i definitely will add this to my skincare routine. apply after anr serum but before your moisturizer. love the smell of this product although, for those who are sensitive to smell it dissipates quickly.",positive
"the first time i applied this my face felt tingly a bit but most likely because i am not use to exfoliating right now. it was irritating and did not because rednessdryness.after applying my skin is hydrated to the touch but i think it is too soon to notice if it has helped with dark spots. i like the blend of ahas,bha and niacinamide and the ease of applying. i also cannot describe the smell but it is not unpleasant but not exactly pleasant either.",neutral

"i was looking for a new moisturizer that included spf for the summer months. the price point was great on this and as i use the kiehls facial cleanser already, i thought id give it a go. i was not impressed with the product. personally i felt it was not hydrating enough. the texture almost has a super mild grit to it. wanted to love it but i will not be buying this again.",neutral

"i have oily skin and live in humid florida, so finding a moisturizer that is light weight and non-greasy is key. i was really excited about this product because i like the list of ingredients and i love the brand, but this was a miss for me. the texture of the gel is this more on the viscousgummy side, and i did not find the scent bothersome compared to other reviewers. but this product sort of just sat on my face and did not absorb very well, it left me feeling a little greasy all day, and i did not use very much- a little goes a long way. this might work better for drier skin types. since the ingredient list is nice, i will be applying this to my decollete instead.",neutral
"i wanted this product to work. i love the other products i have tried from youth to the people but this one leaves my face really really dry. there is nothing special about the smell, or the texture so i could not rate it on any of those things either. i have tried layering the product, but unless i just put oil on my face after using this, i am just left with dry irritated skin. sigh",negative
"my roller ball was a dud, too. i was really looking forward to using it. was able to remove and just pat the oil around my eyes, but i feel like i am missing some of the effect. i love the face oil but not certain i will pay for the eye oil based on my experience with the sample.",negative

"honestly, it is decent and is not as good as it was hyped. def. suitable for dry skin peeps, it is very moisturizing. for combo or oily, not recommended. i have combo skin tzone and i have under surface pimples on my foreheaad after using this. smells nice though. prefer spraying on cotton pad first if you have sensitive skin.",neutral

i love mural line. but this time it is a bit odd because i got different packaging not the same in the photo,neutral

this did not agree with my skin at all.. it because small pimplesbreakouts.. i would not recommend for combo skin. ended up returning,negative
"not sure what the hype is about here. it is creamy and that is about it. honestly, i noticed my first fine lines under my eyes about.months after i started using this product. wanted to like it due to it is affordability compared to my usual eye cream. bummer.",neutral
"this product was extremely drying and harsh on my skin. i thought that this would make some of my dry flakey spots of skin go away but it did the exact opposite. i few days after using this, my dry spots were way more dry and flakey than they had been in weeks. it has been a week since that, and my skin has still not recovered. i think this product would be good for more oily skin.",neutral
"i am in love with this product. i have not used eye creams before as a lot of moisturizers can get the job done alone. however, after using this product, i will never go back! this brightening eye cream is a must try. i have seen such a difference in my skin, it looks bouncy, fresh and youthful. plus, it is vegan and clean from sephora! the best thing about this product is the price tag. you get such high quality at an affordable price. a must buy!!",positive
"i have been a big fan of the double cleanse method for a while now, and had regularly been using cleansing oils as my pre-cleanse. wanting to venture into the cleansing balm world, i had read several positive reviews on this product and wanted to give the green clean balm a try.the texture of the balm is great, and it melts well once applied to dry skin. the spreadability is great, and every once in a while, you get that satisfying feeling as you feel the grits accumulate. however... what got me with this was the smell. i found the plant-like smell hence the name green, i suppose quite off-putting. i kept at this product for one week but just could not get used to it. if you can get past the smell, it is a wonderful product, but with this gripe the price tag, i could not justify continuing to use this, personally.",neutral
"really nice to use during my night-time routine, especially because my acne medication can sometimes dry my skin, and this helps it. i also have sensitive skin and this does not bother me!",neutral
giving this one star based off the smell. did not work that good either. this stuff smells bad. you smell it while it is on your face and it is an unpleasant smell okay? even after washing it off your skin still reeks of this! nasty. and do not even think about laying on your pillow. your pillows going to stink.,negative
made my skin feel soft but did not live up to it is hype would not recommend if you have acne prone skin.,neutral
"i have combination skin and i found this to perfectly moisturize my skin at night. during the day, i use a lighter moisturizer because this one is a little bit too thick. i love that it has no fragrance and how it is packed with ceramides to prevent moisture loss. thanks to this, i wake up with supple skin every morning!",positive
"this smells amazing, kind of like a jolly rancher candy. this is a splurge item because it does not do much but make you feel fabulous for a short time. it is a beautiful smelling spray that i spray on my face and neck before bed. i tried this in the store before i purchased it so i could see if i liked the smell.",positive
"i have been using clean products for almost a year. my acne, large pores have greatly been reduced. however, i wanted to add something stronger for anti aging. i ordered this and within a week started getting acne. i thought it may have been something in my diet. i continued using this until i finished half the bottle. that is when i read that it has parabens. nothing else in my skin or hair care has parabens. i stopped and the acne went away. also, it did not improve my complexion or fine lines at all. but i only used it for month.",negative

i have used this for over a month now-- the advertising claims days to crystal clear skin. unfortunately i break out every other day. at first i thought it was maskne until i got zits on my forehead and other exposed areas. the skin around it though? it is actually bright! i so wanted to love this product but i cannot figure out how to get it to love my entire face. will keep using up the entire bottle until it is finished though.,negative

"i pretty much bought this because of the price point to test it out, but have found that it actually helps a ton. i live in a really dry climate and this year my skin has been reacting really negatively cracking, peeling, feeling tight, etc so i have been amping up my hydratingmoisturizing routine. i use this as a base, then a face oil, then a moisturizer, and my skin feels so much better. this serum absorbs pretty well, it starts like a semi thick liquid, and blends into skin like a very lightweightgel moisturizer. i prefer it at night but i think it absorbs well enough to be applied under makeup.",positive
"ok product for the body, looks great and wears of beautifully, but broke out the skin on my face... might be coconut oil in the ingredients",negative
i really like using this serum. it is light weight and absorbs quickly. i have had awful redness and jawline breakouts since having my last daughter and i saw reduction in redness on my chin and around my nose within just four or five days. i have had no breakouts from this serum and plan to continue use.,positive
"okay...so i wanted to love this product. i had been purchasing the small sizes with my points every time i saw it, and finally but the bullet and bought the full size. it sits only used on my product shelf for months now. i gave it a fair shake and used it daily as instructed for nearly two months. did my skin feel softer? yes. did i notice better evenness? no. did i like the smell and feel? yes. was it worth nearly? mehhhh. i could take it or leave it.",neutral
not my favorite self tanner. leave orange cast. i am on the more fair skinned side but i feel this self tanner is more orangey than others. also has strong self tanner smell but most do. does not tan as even as other either.,neutral

i received this product complimentary via influenster. the packaging is beautiful and well made. the cream inside is a pale pink and smells fresh. it is not heavily fragranced so i would think sensitive skin should have no problem using. this is so light weight and easy to soak into the skin. leaves a fresh and radiant appearance. i have been using this instead of moisturizer and my skin loves it. i will continue to use to see if fine lines and dark spots improve over time.,positive
made my eyes puffier than they were before i applied it. does not work. versed under eye cream is what i recommend. it is the first eye cream that has worked for me.,negative
"i have super dry skin normally so the idea of a face oil makes sense. it feels like most other oils i have tried. it has a mild scent, barely noticeable. when i use it at night i press about a half dropper full into my. it does feel very moisturizing but in the morning my skin feels kind of gunky. this is not necessarily a bad product, i have just come to the the conclusion that most face oils are not for me",neutral
this is a cream that makes your skin really soft. i honestly have not had any eye cream remotely feel the same type of texture,positive
"i do not like how it feels, kind of of like an exfoliate and stings too much.",negative
"my skin is super oily, when i use the product it clean very well my skin, leave it soft, removed the oil and the pores look smaller than the comun size. apart from that it left me a very healthy glow!! for real, these review were for testing purposes but all opinion were my own",positive
"i like how when you can see the progress as your scrubbing, the product turns into like a darker color because of the dirt underneath that it picks up",neutral
great serum to hydrate your skin! i use this every morning and night and it makes my skin feel amazing,positive
"i have very dry skin therefore all my products have to be moisturizing or i get flaky. it is a great toner, did not break me out or make anything worse, but i do not feel it qualifies as a hydrating toner. it made no difference to texture of my skin. so i would only recommend if your main skin concern is not dry, it should do the job for you.",neutral
it is very greasy even if the lotion isverythin. i do not know if it is because of my combination skin type or maybe i haventused regularly. i reallylovethat lotion do not leave a white cut. i received this product complimentary for review purposes.,neutral

"i bought this in store earlier this week. first off, the aroma of this product is really lovely. it is very refreshing on the skin. non-irritating. feels hydrating, but not sticky when used with make up. you could easily use this after cleansing before serum and moisturizer. the bottle is just ounces, so for i feel it is a bit pricey, which is why i give it four stars. however compared to other mists, the price is more reasonable. i do recommend it, this would be suitable for any skin type.",positive
"it is really nice. it goes on with a pink tint that actually slightly brightens the complexion and dries down matte. it is nice under makeup and does not irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin. but this is too small of a bottle for sunscreen. it is not like foundation or concealer where i can skimp on application and go lighter, i need a large enough bottle to make it through the month. i say oz ml bottle for the same price. if i see the value match the price then i am going to repurchase because sunscreen is not an option for me. i see other brands doing the oz size at around this price. supergoop you can do it!",neutral
"i received a free sample of estee lauder revitalizing supreme youth power creme from influenster in return for my honest review. this is one of my al time favorites, to dare, in facial care products. the sample i received was small but it went a long way. i decided to use the entire jar before writing my review so i could testify to short term use results va long term and i am so glad that i did. after days use, morning and night, in addition to my daily routines, i saw results that included finer softer lines around my mouth and eye area. my pores seemed less noticeable and my skin felt firmer. over the next two weeks, i noticed that my age spots were getting lighter. and by week my darkage spots were barely noticeable at all. i was an avid boater on the chesapeake growing up and i worshipped the sun and it is burning rays. sunscreen was not a concern back in the day and i am paying dearly for it in my s with signs of the suns damage from so many years ago. i have tried a variety of face care products but i never had such satisfying noticeable results so fast. especially from a facial cream. my skin appears dewy by week and make up goes on flawlessly over estee lauder revitalizing supreme youth power. the smell is pleasant and not overpowering. the consistency and texture is thick but very smooth i am glad i waited to use the entire sample because the long term use had far more results than what i noticed at. i will be purchasing the full size as soon as it i back in stock and will recommend to anyone with pure confidence.",positive
"amazing product! it is an incredible humectant that draws moisture into your skin. it restores the plumpness of my skin that i have started to lose in my early s. first time i tried it i was completely amazed. does not bother my oily skin. consider it essential for myself and i highly, highly recommend it.",positive
i liked the cleanser at first. i was using it as part of a nightly routine. i have dry sensitive skin and it smelled nice and felt good on my skin. but within a day or so i noticed my face started breaking out drastically. this was the only change in my routine and was i stopped using it my face cleared up and i have had no further problems. seems like a nice product but not a good fit for my skin.,neutral

"i got the sample just to see if i would like it- and i definitely do! i personally do not think the fragrance is too much and i love the ingredients. i have combooily skin, but i like having a bit of a glow. as someone who struggles with rosacea, it helped calm my skin.",positive
"not a bad product, just not my favorite oil. a little too greasyheavy for me.",neutral

"i purchased this in hopes of replacing the infamous shu umera cleansing oil as it is quite pricy compared to this one. i really wanted to love it, it worked okay for the first few days, then it started to give me this horrible horrible break out all over my face, i did not suspect this so i stopped wearing make up for a few weeks to give my skin a rest, but it got worse, sooo much worse... had to throw the rest away. i do not have sensitive skin at all and have not had a break out like that since th grade..",negative
the difference is noticeable after just one week of use. most of the redness from my skin is gone. skin feels very soft and almost velvet like in the morning. will repurchase and definitely recommend!,positive

the cream has a dewy finish on the skin but i cannot get over the scent. i used lemon oil products on wood furniture when i was a child. the scent of this product reminds me of the dusting days. while the finish on the skin is appreciated the odor is not. i could never wear this on my face. i received a free. ml sample in an order.,neutral
"honestly obsessed with this product. had my doubts because i know products like this either tend to take a lot of time to work, or do not work at all. i was prepared for my skin to purge and it definitely did, for maybe weeks or so but now i can use it every day on my hyperpigmentation with no break outs. i have struggling badly with hyperpigmentation for at least a year due to hormonal acne and i swear i can notice a difference after each use even. also, the smell is nowhere near as people make it out to be i think they fixed this actually.",positive

"i am and have been using an eye cream for the past years. this is the first time an eye cream has gotten into my eyes and given me conjunctivitis. i had so many issues with my eyes burning, itchy, watery, redness and they all went away when i stopped using this eye cream. i guess something about the formula makes it slippery and migrate into my eyes while i am sleeping. it is too bad because i totally believe in the benefits of this eye cream and the price is reasonable, but in the end i had to go back to my usual perricone md eye cream. no issues with my eyes since. the skin around my eyes is pretty tough since i have been smearing tretinoin on it for a few years now the tret formula and the perricone md cream never get into my eyes like the charlotte cream did. another thing i wanted to mention is the huge honking plastic packaging. i do not have a ton of space to store my cosmetics and skincare the component of this eye cream is much bigger than my face cream it is a disgusting unnecessary waste of plastic and space. charlotte should switch her cheap plastic packaging for glass components, and make the component of this eye cream an appropriate size.",negative

visibly reduced the dark circles under my eyes and softening of the lines around my eyes. took about weeks to see a difference.,positive
"honestly, i do not understand what all the fuss is about. it has never burned or even tingled that much for me. i do notice a bit of exfoliation and thus an increase in glow but i think other products work better oskias renaissance mask and peter thomas roths pumpkin enzyme mask come to mind. it is not bad, it is just not life-changing.",neutral
"hard to apply, smells really strong and not in a pleasant way, did nothing to my skin, and its consistency is so runny that i had to be really careful to not get it into my eyes. disappointed.",negative
"i did not like this cream. being that i have acne prone skin, i refused to finish my deluxe sample on my face because it caused break outs. i am using it for hand cream until it finishes. being that it costs, i am glad i got the sample rather than buying the full size and being disappointed. this product also made my face greasy and it just did not work out for me. i do love other fresh products but just not this one.",negative

"i have been dehydrated and feeling out of shape this year. i noticed tons of fine lines developing under my eyes and figured it was due to aging and a poor diet. i ordered this on a whim and used it for about three nights in a row. suddenly, those fine lines had disappeared. what?? i could finally wear face makeup without looking more haggard, as a result of my fine lines sucking in all the makeup. so, of course i now wear this night n day. also, i started gifting this to gfs on bdays. hey, those blasted fine lines can happen to anyone.",positive
"this is a great cream, do not get me wrong, but it has a very strong fragrance. normally i do not care about smells but it is a little overwhelming. plus, as someone who really cares about ingredients, fragrance is one of the worst things you can put on your skin regardless of whether it gives you a reaction or not. caudalie is clean but i really wish this cream had no fragrance otherwise i would give it stars and repurchase. however i have recently tried the biossance repair cream and it is the perfect, fragrance-free version of this cream. i would buy that instead!",neutral
love me some sunday riley...... just not this product i have drier under eyes with puffiness in the morning. i found this product actually made my eyes looked k drier and did nothing to reduce am puffiness. i am a huge fan of all sunday products good genes and juno are holy grail in my life!!!! so sad,negative
"i was not a big fan of the ceo line- the oil and the serum, but i really love their retinol products. i love the a retinoid as it left my face so soft, tightened pores, etc. i switched to the luna oil for winter, and it is really great for my dry skin. even in very dry new england winter, with my humidifier on in the room, i do not have to apply moisturizing cream after the oil. highly recommend.",positive
by far not my favorite face mask from sephora. the texture is gross and almost gel like. the smell of the mask is unpleasant i wanted to take it off as soon as i put it on. i waiting about minutes or so did not feel much of a difference. would not purchase again honestly,neutral
"i actually like using this toner--i like the way it smells and how refreshing it is--but it ended up just being too strong for me. people should know that it has glycolic acid in it, which is the strongest aha--do not start with this if you are new to chemical exfoliants! for some reason it took me a bottle and a half to figure that out and to realize that it was causing my skin to become sensitized, which just made my normally mild breakouts and oiliness act up instead of improve. i would not normally say i have sensitive skin historically oilycomboacne-prone, but it is a bit delicate and now that i am in my mid-s, my skin barrier can get worn down from strong ingredients like these. this might work on younger teenage skin or on people whose skin is less reactive.",neutral
"i used to love these eye patches but something about them always bothered me but could not quite pin point it. but i am wearing these now as i am about to go to bed and realized that they are uncomfortable because it is oddly shaped. i have almond shaped eyes and they are definitely not fitting well. the part that dips under the eye is just too narrow and circular that it is not really covering as much under eye space as i would like it to. also, it scoops up way too high and that it is awkwardly poking my lower lid.",negative
"i really liked this product, but it dries out my face. overnight it took away discoloration which was great! unfortunately it also dried out my skin overnight not sure why? i have tried it again on various occasions to see if it was just a spoof. i have only noticed happening on my face. neck, chest, etc are fine! the oil smell is not potent at all and feels great during application.",positive
"i love the dewy cream so i decided to try the water cream as i am entering my s and it says this is good for aging skin. i have fairly smooth skin with minor fine lines that i wanted to diminish and that is why i bought this. this stuff made my skin super bumpy. i started doing research on skin care for dry skin and found out that lactic acid is not good for really dry skin, which this product has. the packaging is nice. i loved the touch of the spoon on the top, but if you have dry skin like me, do not get it. it is made for someone with oily skin type. they need to update the section for who this product is for.",negative
"on its own, this eye treatment is so-so, but it works well in combination with biossances marine algae eye cream.",neutral

"i must also say this is my first ever milk makeup product, so i had high expectations. i actually love the packaging of this with the rollerball pump, it is really convenient and avoids messes. you also have way more control over the amount of oil that goes on your face. the scent is very citrusy, so if you prefer unscented steer clear. i personally have no issues with that, so i like the fragrance. the oil is super light abs does not feel goopy. you will see i added just a light amount to get a little shine. this is fine prior to adding makeup, but it does take awhile to fully soak into skin i would wait at least min, so keep that in mind.",positive

"this face wash was definitely gentle. it was a gentle exfoliator, and the exfoliating scrub dissolved quickly, as described in the product description. i personally felt that the exfoliator dissolved too quickly my face was left feeling like it could have used more exfoliating, but that may also be because i used it in the shower. it smelled very sweet, like strawberries, but if you do not like smelly cleansers then this is not for you. i am not sure how cleansed my skin felt afterwards, and it left my skin feeling a bit dry my skin is normally dry at baseline. not sure if i would recommend this product, but if you like very gentle cleansersexfoliators with a nice smell then go for it! i received this product complimentary for review purposes.",neutral

"sephora skin care has been really hit-or-miss for me, and this one is a big miss. i have used this product for about a month, and it is doing nothing for my skin. no glow, no brightening. my skin feels really tight immediately after using it, and looks almost matte, like it has completely stripped the oils from my skin. it is also causing additional flakiness and redness on my cheeks, and i have never had sensitive skin. i suspect the bamboo stem powder is just way too harsh for this type of application.",negative
"the product is okay, i found that the first four days of using it i found it made a big difference, but only using it twice a week is not as significant. i think it is a great introduction to actives and super gentle but if you already use aha and bha i do not think it is necessary",neutral

not really seeing a difference after several weeks of use. still have a lot of texture in my dry areas the consistency is weirdly sticky. sometimes does not lay well with my other products. would rather spend a little. irwin money and get the glossier version or the drunk elephant one,neutral
"i have such a lovehate relationship with this product but ultimately cannot recommend it because it is cons outweigh the pros. it has easy packaging and an easy application style, and i could tell a difference at first with my fine lines and even a milia spot near my eye area. i actually loved the product so much i bought a backup and added it to my loves. however, this only lasted maybe months before i actually felt like my fine lines were becoming more noticeable and i think it is due to the fact that the product is a little hard and tugs at the delicate skin around the eye. i also just noticed an overall lack in hydration and worsening of dark circles. as soon as i switched to a different eye cream, these problems lessened. so i hate to say it, since i had great results at first, but this is definitely not worth it in the end.",negative
"my primer must be the best in the world, because this did not remove my makeup. the packaging boasted its ability to remove mascara, which is always a plus, but i had to go back and use my makeup remover after i used this cleanser. because of this, not my jam.three stars because it smells great and feels nice. it is not a bad product per se, but the makeup removing piece was what i was looking for.",neutral
"i have combo skin that is more oily in the summer and dryer in the winter this is a good product for removing make up therefore this is a good product to use as the first step in a double cleanse routine--i like to use it in my night time skincare routine to remove make up and sunscreen. i used it alone just for kicks and it left my skin feeling really oily and weighed down, and broke out the next day.",positive
this product is amazing. when using this do not expect this product to work immediately! it requires a lot of patience. the reason why you are not going to get rapid results. it is simply because the product is giving your skin cells time to adjust. thus by doing so your skin can be clear and your pores even smaller.,positive
so good!! i have been using this for about years now and i trusted it back when i had really bad acne all across my face. it never leaves a streaky residue as some might expect from sun protection products and it keeps my skin moisturized all day long. i have super oily skin but its contained my oils during moderate weather but it does not protect me when i sweat.,positive

"yes, it oddly smells like buttered popcorn jellybeans, but the scent fades quickly. it is a little dry feeling on my dry skin, but performs well with my foundation and concealer. the white cast also fades quickly on me. i prefer a dewier sunscreen as mineral can be too drying, so while i will finish this bottle, i am not sure i will repurchase.",positive
"the colour of the tan is great from the ankles up! my feet somehow turned orange which is disappointing. i bought the tanning mitt as well, which i definitely recommend to anyone considering buying this! the lack of instant pigment makes this a better option for more experienced tanners. i am hoping the second application goes better!",neutral

i had bought the mini size to make sure i liked it. i love this. it completely covers and neutralizes my redness to my face. all i have to do it set it with setting powder. i have no need for foundation. will most definitely be buying the bigger size. i highly recommend this product.,positive

"i received this free for a review. i am very careful what skincare products i use because there are so many on the market making false claims, and that have ingredients that promise to be effective but are not. case in point, when i consider a chemical exfoliant as in these peel pads, i want to know the ph level of the acid, because if it is not the correct ph level it will not effectively exfoliate, no matter how much active ingredients are used. i do not know the ph, nor did i have test strips to see for myself, so i am uncertain if i would recommend these. i have used these for about a week, and in my early to mid s, have skin in fairly good condition with minimal fine lines and occasional acne, but cannot tell if this made a difference in the week i have used it. if this is i believe within a ph of-, it should work well and is a decent price- i cannot tell. the pads are well hydrated...they are adequately saturated with product not too dry like some other skincare pre-moistened pads are.",neutral

"glow recipe kindly gifted me this product and i have been testing it out for almost two weeks now and i have really enjoyed it! when applied as skincare or primer, it leaves my skin feeling and looking healthy and glowy without getting too oily! it absorbs quickly into the skin and meshes well with any other products i have paired with it. it also works on top of makeup for a fresh and natural highlighted look, but i prefer it as a step between skincare and makeup! i apply after all my skincare and before my primer and have loved it that way. even when i do not wear makeup, i have reached for this to help give my skin a boost! it can leave a bit of a tacky feel but only for a little bit. once it dries down all the way i do not notice it! overall i am enjoying this product, as it helps my skin look and feel glowy and healthy without causing me to look too oily or greasy and i have combo skin!. i would recommend this if you are looking for something that will help increase the glow in your skin!",positive

"i really loved the packaging. it is simple, clean, yet sophisticated. it is truly a reflection of diors main theme. i suffer from extremely dry hands, so influenster is a godsend for gifting me this! it makes my hands feel nice and comfortable. it calms my redness and gets rid of the stretchy feeling in my hands. it is also really good for calming down the redness on my face. i like the fact that it is multi use, and you can use it as a face cream, mask, hand cream, body cream, and foot cream. i would highly recommend this to anyone who has dry skin. ps it is unscented, so it is good for my sensitive skin.",positive
"this face mask is super hydrating! i absolutely love it. it does leave your pillowcase slightly greasy and has a yellow tinge to it, but i still think it is worth it. my skin is glowing by morning. it is a must have if you live somewhere with a dry winter like me!",positive
"so bad. it broke me out like crazy, do not waste you are money just go with the hero cosmetic lightening wand.",negative
broke me out. it is very good for a base before face makeup though.,negative
"i have been waiting for a sunscreen from glow recipe, and this one is outstanding. i love that it is a blend of mineral and chemical sunscreens which provide the best protection from both areas. the sunscreen is lightly scented with a fruity fresh smell, and spreads easily. upon application there is no white cast left on my face, and after a few minutes it absorbs with no oiliness. i love the fact that it has hyaluronic acid and niacinamide which contribute to more even tone skin. this also functions to hydrate skin without greasiness. i also love the glow afterwards that the sunscreen gives, so your skin looks felt very refreshed and healthy. make up applies easily on top and the sunscreen wears well throughout the day.",positive
this serum is quite nice. the texture is nice upon application and it does not break me out at all. i do notice an immediate radiance to the skin after applying it and have noticed an overall improvement in the colour of my skin. the downfall for me is the strong smell of oranges and that you do need to follow this with a moisturizer to replenish the skin.,positive
love it! i use this instead of moisturizer and it gives a sort of glow and is so good for your skin!!,positive

"i got this because the salicylic acid cleanser would dry my skin out after using to where i would have to immediate put hyaluronic acid on, so i figured this would be a decent alternative and would not dry my face out. it was not drying, but i feel it did not also do much of anything. it does not lather well, and i did not feel or see much of any difference. it is just not for me, but i will sure others would find it great.",neutral
"this cleanser is nothing special. it has a very clean scent and did not break me out. it did not leave my skin feeling tight or dry after using it. it does not remove your makeup after one wash, you will need to double cleanse",neutral
"i got the mini size to try out! wonderful product that leaves my skin so smooth and plump. would definitely recommend this product but you may want to go full size, the dropper is the worst. taking one star off for flimsy, hard to get product out and you get the tiniest amount from the dropper... awful! for such a luxe high end brand, they need to do better then that!",positive
i actually prefer this that and the original because it is faster and gives the same results. just make sure to moisturize so you do not get orange dry spots,positive
this is the only cleanser which i have purchased second time in my life!!! and one of the very rare products which i will continue to buy again and again. it has been said that there is no need to spend so much on cleansers but i am a person who just needs a great cleanser for my face because it initiates the skincare process. if you are someone who loveneed a great cleanser this is the one. it just refreshes my mornings.,positive
it made my skin darker while applying it! pathetic!surely returning this.,negative
i purchased this with the hopes that it will even my skin tone and rid my dark spots. i liked the idea that it is meant to act as a serum and toner and i was really exited and determined to use this product. unfortunately it did not work for me. after using up the whole bottle i have not noticed much change on my uneven skin and dark spots. i have used other products that have worked much better.,neutral
"i normally have oily skin but have been experiencing dryness, especially on my forehead. this did nothing. it made my skin a little sticky but i did not experience any moisturizing or plumping effects. also, please be careful opening the cap. i pulled it too hard i guess and the whole pump came off and caused a good of the product to jump out. hopefully they will change it to twist top or something for future customers. i am still on the search for a good moisturizer or moisturizing treatment.",negative
"i really wanted to love this product. i was sold on the aesthetic and the concept behind the product, especially when one of my favorite skin care enthusiasts highly recommended this product! while i love that it does do what it promised, my undereye wrinkles puffiness do look better after applying it overnight! but, you really only need a super thin layer for the product to work. unfortunately, the packaging does not really support this, as sometimes even when i am not applying pressure to the tube, the product continues to squeeze out on its own when i first got this product, i thought it would be okay to apply the excess product to places already applied, but i learned my lesson as i had a few bumps the next morning. while i do love this product, the price and the packaging difficulty do not really make me feel like i am getting the most out of my money i will continue using until i finish, but still debating whether i will repurchase!",neutral
"i received this free from influenster and sephora. i was excited to try it, hrs of moisture! wow! it is a nice gel and soaks in well, but my skin did not feel as hydrated as i thought. i would be willing to try it again with a larger size to really see if there is improvement over time.",neutral
"first time buying a peeling solution. my skin the next day is clean and glowing. i would wish it would be a bit stronger to clean out my stubborn black heads. but for the price, i am overall happy.",positive

"i received a free sample of dr. zenovia peptide ceramide repairing moisturizer in exchange for an honest review. i was blown away by this moisturizer. i have to stress how good this moisturizer felt on my face. it is hands down the best feeling moisturizer i have ever had. i gave it stars out of because of the cost. also, the fact that after i stopped using it i had a major break out that i think is due to the moisturizer being hormonal. all in all i recommend this moisturizer.",neutral
"i stay away from products containing dimethicone silicone and completely on my own part, failed to read the ingredients on this mask. my skin reacts immediately to it and low and behold, a day later my normally clear skin has pimples. this product is not for me, it may be for you.",negative
"i do not think this is worth the money. it does not go on smoothly. when smoothing it on, it pills.... best i can describe. it does not smooth on like a creamlotion. i have to spread it out and then pat it in or it starts pilling. it also does not have a great smell. i would not recommend it for oily skin. i have combination and using it in the summer made my skin feel greasy. i might try another one of their products, but would not repurchase this one.",negative
"okay so beware guys, this exfoliator is extreme. if you need a deep physical exfoliator then great. i got this as a sample and it is harsh. huge clumps of skin come off in your hands, it is actually kind of gross. i usually use chemical exfoliators so it freaked me out.",positive
does not take off eyeliner. useless! i had high hopes and am super disappointed.,negative
"i highly recommend this product and yttp in general. this was the first product i bought from them and i have been using it as a night cream for almost two years now. in the winter i use it with the prickly pear serum for added moisture and in the summer the vitamin c. i have combination skin but, tend to be more on the dry side. this really has made my skin more supple and bright.",positive
"most oils, in fact most skincare products break me out eventually, but the two times i have used argan oil for extended periods it has calmed my skin down completely. hydration is adequate, although not as potent as an actual moisturizer and yet it is not oily- any argan oil on the surface of my face has more or less vanished within half an hour or so of application. coming from someone who has very oily skin, this is quite unbelievable! the very first time i tried, it was straight after a reaction to cliniques ddmg. i did not expect i could get away with using this on my face but it was literally the only thing available to me at that moment that was fragrance-free and natural. i cautiously applied a couple of drops to my flaky forehead on a night and checked the mirror first thing in the morning. what a surprise! no bumps, no increase in flakiness and my skin felt less tight. i then thought what the heck and used a few more drops that morning. i did this every am and pm. each passing day my skin became restored more and more to its former condition- clear, flake free and breakout free. i eventually stopped using it only because my skin was reset and i was itching to try some new products again nothing new there!. also perfect for adding shine to my hair a couple of drops daily and on cuticles. a very versatile product indeed! my sephora top must-have list my top must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at sephora. hair loss treatment divine herbal- hair oil. shampoo sephora collection- deep cleaning shampoo. face mask peter thomas roth- pumpkin enzyme mask. pigmentation anti-aging serum divine herbal- facial treatment serum. face scrub sisley- botanical gentle buffing cream. lip balm nuxe- reve de miel lip balm. lip liner sephora collection- rouge gel lip liner",positive

i just started using this the other day and it cleanses your skin without stripping it. the product turns into oil by rubbing it into your skin and leaves it super soft after. i just started using it but i recommend!,positive
"this product feels great on the skin. it has also helped with my adult acne. it has a slight smell but that does not bother me. however, i have tried different ways to incorporate this into my skincare routine. each and every time it pills. it just flakes off when i apply my moisturizer. the only way this flakingpilling does not happen is when i use this as my only serum for the night. i love the results that i get so i recommend it.",neutral
"this exfoliator did not do much for my skin. i did not notice any changes or improvements, not bad smelling, feels nice, but did not make a difference on my skin and not worth in my personal opinion!",neutral
"i really enjoy the mask texture and colour, it is a lovely pop at night! does it really do anything for my skin? i do not notice a major difference but it keeps my skin moisturized and i do not break out. but the one thing i cannot get over is the packaging. it is completely useless, every time i have to scoop out the cream it does not feel clean and all the antioxidant ingredients are oxidizing.",neutral
also received this in the allure box and noticed it was yellow and greasy. i did not feel like it hydrated my skin at all. i hope i did not apply an expired product on my face.,negative

"i am a fair-skinned blonde and this works perfectly for me. holy grail tanner. i add- drops to my facial moisturizer, and within a few hours i have a really beautiful glow. not much of a tan, but it takes away winter pastiness and gives me a bit of a glow without any orangeness.",positive
"the new blueberry bounce cleanser is an instant hg item. smells good, cleans good, feels good. i love the pump bottle, as i can see the product and dispense it easily. i would call this cleanser a gel cleanser, but its thicker and more viscous then other gel cleansers i have used before. it leaves my skin feeling cleansed and soft and bouncy. my favorite way to use is to lather on my face in the shower, and then leave the super fine and soft bubbles on for a minute or so before rinsing.",positive
"i was so excited to try this but sadly it broke me out i did not want to waste it and return it so i have been using it strictly on my neck and shoulder area which has been nice! of course it is super cheap but even if it did not break me out, it is nothing crazy i would not repurchase.",neutral
i have dry aging skin. this product made my skin even drier. i had to use a heavy moisturizer on top of it. i do not recommend.,negative
feels like i am just rinsing my face with water. hand soap would do a better job,negative
"i received this in my voxbox, last week. i have been using it nightly since then with just a regular cotton ball. theirs no tingling sensation while use, which is great because i have skin sensitivities. the smell was a turn off at first, but during use theirs no strong fragrance to the produce. i will say, some small black heads i had became more prominent after use which is unfortunate. would recommend for the people with skin sensitivities and scent sensitivities.",neutral
"nothing special, yet. it is a nice texture, i do not notice much of a fragrance after continued use. i have been using it a few weeks and i have not seen any change in my under eye texture or dark circles. i will continue to use it but unless i start seeing results i will not purchase it in the future. i was sent this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",neutral
caused me to break out!!! did more research and just because it is a higher does not mean it is better,neutral
i received this serum for testing purposes. i was excited to try it since i am all about skin care. it was disappointing. the packaging itself is outdated estee lauder could use an update. my mom used to buy this stuff when i was a kid and the packaging has not changed at all. let us get to the actual product i use good genes by sunday riley and would much rather invest in buying it again than buying this overpriced serum. my skin is dry and this did nothing to help me feel hydrated. the texture is sticky and did not do much for my skin. i do not recommend it.,negative
like the product.absolutely hate the bottle. very difficult to get any product out. please redesign!!!,neutral
i really wanted to love this product but it is just ok. there are certain areas specifically around my cheeks that it seems to hydrate and possibly reduce fine lines but my main concern are forehead lines and it has not done much to improve those in the months that i have been using this product. at least it was a affordable. i will be switching to something else when it is done.,neutral
"unfortunately, this product did not react well on my skin at all. it felt nice going on, but within minutes my skin was burning and i had red splotches on my face and neck. my neck has proven to be sensitive in the past, but my face typically does not have a reaction like this. i will not be able to use this product anymore. also, i did not actively apply the product to my eye area. the splotches by my eye are from the little bit on my hands when i added moisturizer. this product was gifted to me by farmacy beauty.",negative

"i have super oily skin, and it was not hydrating enough. it does feel light weight. my dry patches on my skin remained dry and flaky. when using this with my ordinary serums, i started to pill after using spf on top of this moisturizer... i did some research and it may be because of the silicone in this product. if i use it, it would be with no serums and spf.",negative
i have been using this about a month and i like it. cannot really say if it is making a difference or improving my skin in any way but i like it fine. probably will not bother to buy it again though.,neutral

"i feel like i actually see a pretty dramatic difference in my undereyes when i use this cream and i want to like it so much. but...the packaging is just awful. it is a tiny bottle with a narrow neck that you need to use a spatula to scrape out. it is just a giant pain to use, keep track of the spatula etc. i know that skincare these days is some kind of religious experience for people and companies are pushing the envelope, but can we please just put this in a jar or tube please?",neutral
"i used my points to get a little trial size of this and while the container it came in was super cute, i was surprisingly underwhelmed by this product and would not necessarily recommend it to anyone. i will not say i hated it so it is not that i would tell anyone not to use it because we all have different skin, but to me, it was just meh.i did not like the scent and i was not impressed with the feel of it. it felt a little too thin and i did not feel like it really did anything for my skin. i am years old with skin that is suddenly looking its agerough.in comparison, i love tatchas the dewy skin cream plumping hydrating moisturizer. that product, i fully recommend over this one, and made sure i bought a full-sized version of. that one leaves my skin looking dewy and healthy. this product, no so much that i can recall...",neutral
there are a lot of good ingredients in herbivores oils but the first or second ingredient is coconut oil which clogs pores. why make a great product and ruin it with coconut oil? it is great for your body but does not belong on your face!,neutral

"i wanted to love this! the color on this tanner is amazing, however it is not goof-proof. it is hard to see exactly where you placed the tanner. i believe that someone who is advanced at using self-tanner, and has the time to properly calculate out how many sprays are used per each leg, this product would work really well. i unfortunately just do not have time for this and need a tan before the weekend, so i have returned this for an easier to use product. i do think that i had some user error with this. the color went on really well on my thighs, but near my knees and shins it was splotchy and uneven. i would recommend this to someone who has used tanner before, and has the time to properly apply this. i would not recommend it for a beginner who is new to tanning, and may not know how to use it properly. i think that there is definitely trial and error with this product.",neutral
"a friend recommended this from a hair dresser. my friend and i both ordered and used. we look like freak shows. splotchy-quick during but no color, so no guide! unexplained splotches. awful. returning. do not buy!",negative
i liked the product. it feels very light when applied. but it gets very tight when it dried down. wait till the product is dry before putting any other product over it. i felt the product just just does not do its thing as well if you just put cream after cream after cream on.,neutral
"good for texture, did not break me out. i do have acne prone skin which is impressive.",neutral

"unlike many other water based sleeping masks, this is an opaque, almost pudding-like texture. it is quite marvelous! while it takes a bit longer to soak in, trust me, it is worth it. you will wake up to taut, glowy, baby-smooth skin. absolutely worth the money!!",positive
seriously what is in this?! it works so insanely well. i suffer from redness in my cheeks and just really inflamed skin. the second i sprayed this on my skin and left the bathroom my sister asked me if i just put on foundation!!! this is a new holy grail product. i highly recommend for anyone who suffers from redness or inflamed skin.,positive
"you definitely do get the benefits of vitamin c with this product. my skin is brighter after using this cream for about a month. but the formula is weird. the product feels sticky on my face and pills so badly! i have not been able to use it with any other product such as a serum. so the price point is great but depending on how elaborate your nighttime routine is, it might not be for you.",neutral
"these are okay. i do not think they are the most nourishing masks and they definitely will not heal severely dry, cracked feet, but they can be a good go-between lotions and creams.",neutral
"i have acne-prone, oily skin, but lately, my skin has been really dehydrated. i got this moisturizer to fix the dehydration, expecting that it might make my skin slightly more oily than usual. but i had heard so many rave reviews about this moisturizer helping dehydration that i thought it was worth it. sadly, this really disappointed. when you first put it on, it feels very thick and moisturizing, but not oily. the problem is that i never felt like it penetrated the surface of the skin. after an hour or so, my face would feel really yucky and oily, but still dehydrated. it did absolutely nothing to help my dehydrated skin. i gave it a because i like the packaging. there is a push dispenser, which is more hygienic than a typical jar of moisturizer. it does not have a fragrance, which i like. other skin types might find this hydrating, but it did not work for me.",neutral
"it is one of the loveliest cleaners i have ever used. i use the cleansing oil from this brand if i have a full beat, but if i have light makeup, then i can just use this alone. it is one of the few cleansers that does not sting my eyes. my skin is left feeling perfectly balanced. i have combination skin that is acne prone, and my skin reacts very well with this cleanser.",positive
"i am a skin care junkie and was excited to try this because of the retinol. although i do feel that glow recipe is formulated for a younger demographic..... i am, so anti-aging is important to me, but i do not have a lot of fine lines as of yet. my skin is relatively normal and not sensitive, but i like to feel hydrated and fresh. the first night i wore this, the next morning my under eye area felt dry and tight, so i thought maybe i did not use enough product? i tried it the next night, little more product, exact same result. by the rd morning i noticed the outer corner of my eyes was getting irritated",negative
one of my new favorite self tanning products! i have used it the last days in a row and i could not be happier with the color. the self tanner i always use on my body lasts over a week so this product really helps keep my face matching my body. i also normally breakout very easily but so far i have had zero skin irritations with this!,positive
"yeah....this facial mist is incredibly overpriced and over-hyped for what it does. the mist itself- which so many yters and reviewers raved about- is actually sort of terrible. even though the particles feel delicate and fine, the mist itself shoots out rather than creating a fine cloud of gorgeous hydration, like all my favorite mists usually do. the scent of watermelon jolly rancher might be nice for a body lotion or candle, but on my face it feels far too sweet and not at all refreshing. i feel like i have to use so much product to cover my face, and since you do not get much in the bottle itself, it is not a good value whatsoever. the sad thing is i usually adore glow recipe, and it is rare i find a hydrating mist i do not like, but i do not like this. it is perfectly ok, but i have found much better from similar korean and asian skincare brands for half the cost, without half the hype. this is not a product i will be repurchasing.",negative
"the price point on this can reasonably scare you off. i do not even know what madness overcame me when i ordered the oil cleanser, rice polish, and this. but once the damage was done, ooh i could not wait. it is been about a month now, and i was looking for fair pictures from before and after. i wanted to see the pictures next to each other to see if i could even tell a difference, and when i noticed it i thought i should share. my skin is not perfect but there is a brighter, fullness to it. is it a difference? eh",positive

"this really helped my sensitive dry skin. this brand was recommended to me by a sephora employee. i tried another item from fab and it was ok and i really did not see the difference. this has made my face less itchy, reduced the redness. i do not notice the bad smell. i like it",positive
"after trying many face oils, this gorgeous and light oil is the clear winner. it adds a perfect punch of moisture to my nighttime routine and keeps my skin healthy following retinol a, leaving me plump and refreshed every morning. the price may seem steep in comparison to other oils that do not do anything beyond moisture, but you can use such a teensy amount two small drops are plenty that the larger size lasts me at least months!",positive
"bought this because i was on the market for a brightening moisturizer for my acne scars. a sephora employee recommended this moisturizer and raved about the high concentration of vitamin c in this product. i am not going to lie, i was sold the second i smelled the delicious creamsicle scented moisturizer. it reminded me of my childhood memories of having ice cold creamsicles in the overbearing summer heat. little did i know that this resembled my childhood memories a little too much. my indulgence in creamsicles in my past made me a hefty child and my splurge in creamsicle scented moisturizer made me break out. i woke up with pesky whiteheads after using this cream. it took me days and whiteheads later to realize that this cream, this cream that was supposed to help with my acne scars is actually creating more acne! this prompt me to read the entire package for purge warnings and there is absolutely nothing. oh and as if breaking out is not bad enough, this product sits on your face and gives you a greasy and waxy look. on the bright side, my skin did clear up after i switch back to my tried and true de moisturizer. i guess the lesson here is that creamsicle and i just are not meant to be. tldr- this product might be related to the frat boys that you meet in college, all talk and no show. best part is, it is still going to hurt you while wasting your time.",negative
"this is my new favorite toner. the. oz bottle lasted months of twice daily use. the pump feature makes this toner super easy to use. i have very dry skin and i used to have dry patches all over but since i started using this i have had super smooth and even textures skin. the exfoliating properties of this toner are perfect for textured skin. it burns slightly in the beginning and after using an exfoliating cleanser, but it is not too harsh. i will be repurchasing this product.",positive
"i do enjoy this product, i read the ingredients on sephoras website and loved what i saw. however, when the cleanser arrived i read the ingredients and to my surprised parfum is one of the first ingredients. this was not listed in the ingredients on the website, or i would not have ordered it. i do not think it has irritated my skin, but i do not like the idea of cleaning my face with perfume.",neutral
i love fresh but this product just did not do it for me. i really liked the smell and thought it felt nice but it was not particularly effective as a setting spray. maybe i am just a little too oily though?,neutral

"i got this product free for review from influenster. i have never tried guerlain products so i was so excited to try this. pros if you are someone with oily skin, this is a really nice serumoil that does not make your skin feel like an oil slick. it also does feel very hydrating and makeup applies nicely over top. cons this is definitely a splurge and i will be honest, i do not think the results are worth the price. yes it made my skin feel nice but i have gotten similar results using more inexpensive products. i would buy this if i felt like treating myself but otherwise, i do not think it will become a holy grail product.",neutral
"i have had this sitting on my desk at work, and i give myself a spritz once or twice a day. it makes my skin feel so refreshed and hydrated, and it feels like a boost in the afternoon. the beautiful smell that i love about the watermelon sleeping mask is here too. and this is not important to the product effectiveness, but it is really cute and pink and i do not feel cluttery having it out on my desk. i was given the product to review for free by glow recipe, but i will happily purchase again when i run out.",positive

"i like this product, however, it is now winter and my skin is parched. it does not hydrate enough. i use this as a serum, then i put a thicker cream to keep my skin feeling hydrated and soft. the good thing, it does not give milia amd scentless.",neutral
"i do not want to give this product a star only because i know that it will work one certain skin types, however, it does not work on mine- but if this stuff is right for you, do not discount it completely. sadly with my experience, after two uses, it completely dried my skin out and let me with flakey burning patching all over and i have very oily skin naturally. i think the of salicylic acid in there was far too strong for my skin- but it might not be for others. yes, it did remove some acne very fast but it also gave me a bad reaction. luckily i was able to return it and someone at sephora guided me in the right direction and i am very happy with the product i have now!",neutral
"i really wanted to love this, but i am so fair that when i applied it i looked orange like an oompa loompa. i had to take it all off. i then tried with just a little product, but then i did not get the coverage.",negative
i am not super in love with this product. sometimes it stings my skin a little and do not get it in your eyes it burns!! i wish it was moisturising but you get a lot of product for the price!,positive
this is the best makeup remover i have ever used-- i will never use anything else!,positive
"after using this product for two weeks i noticed my skin has better appearance, it is very important to combine it with a serum in order to avoid itching.i think of the ingredients are good to help taking care of the skin.the packaging is very nice, i did not like much that is expensive but you do not need a lot of product so it will last a reasonable amount of time.",positive
"growing up this was my favorite product to steal from my mom and when i was finally older i bought some for myself. i used this eye cream almost every other day for years. i could not tell you the last time i had dark bags under my eyes. it smells amazing, it feels amazing. worth the splurge",positive
"i love this serum, it is gentle and hydrating and super effective in fading my newer hyperpigmentation spots",positive
this stuff is like an oil slick and i have very dry skin!! it never seems to soak in and leaves my face tacky and greasy feeling. i love the confidence in a cream so i was excited to try this but it is a no go.,negative
"smelled nice, did not break me out. it it also did not really moisturize. went to bed with it feeling greasy on my skin, woke up with it feeling the same.",neutral
"i really love the texture. the cream is yellow and has a light gel consistency. a little goes a long way. it absorbs nicely and is not tacky once it is absorbed. it seemed to break me out a little. at least, i think it did, because i broke out soon after i started using it. it also made me a little oily later. it does smell good though. it smells like citrus.",neutral
this really helps to keep my skin so hydrated and healthy. i have noticed my skin has gotten more firm after using it. my skin definitely has a healthy glow now that i use this. i use this everyday in the morning. gifted by facegym,positive
"i am on my second bottle of the ptr acne clearing gel and honestly love the results. it is pretty gentle on the skin, and gives nice hydration as well as keeping breakouts to a minimum. highly recommend this product if you are struggling with acne and have dry skin it truly helps!",positive
this new formula is awful. it makes my skin greasy and does not sit well under my foundation. very disappointed. i guess i will go back to clinique.. i do not have the energy to try to find a new moisturizer again.,negative
"mini plumped my angry line by my left eyebrow but not my lines near eyes... it is okay, nothing special. i would rather switch back to la prairie. the white caviar eye serum did wonders, even my laser clinic place noticed a difference.",negative
i received this complimentary from influenster for reviewing purposes. the packing is beautiful and i love that you can just buy the refills and save a little money. it is a very think cream and it is yellow and does not sink into your skin very well. i only wear it at night because it is so greasy and think.,neutral
i received this complimentary from sulwhasoo. this is a fantastic serum i use every morning right after cleansing. it has a herbal scent which is very invigorating and this serum leaves my skin feeling very plump and hydrated. it is a great serum that helps prep your skin for the other products. i highly recommend trying this! this is one serum that i know i will be repurchasing!,positive
"it did not do anything for me-- also, i do not think salicylic acid is really effective when it is in an oil. i ended up returning. i have had more success with exfoliantbha before facial oil. that said, my concerns are in order oilinessdehydration, pores, and the occasional breakout. when my friend who is way more acne-prone and first got me into skincare a couple years ago! used it, it did not break her out, so maybe this is a good sensitive skin option.",negative
"this is an ok moisturizer that is not greasy or sticky. unfortunately, it is quite heavily rose scented, i would prefer if it was fragrance-free. first couple of times i used it my skin felt itchy, i think it is because of the fragrance as i am usually quite sensitive to them. something else that i did not like- it has a dense texture that dries somewhat quickly on the skin. i cannot wear makeup on top of it as it forms lumps and clumps when i try to even out the foundation on top of it. also, i am not a fan of the texture of the cream itself, i have a drier skin type and prefer heavier creams that leave a greasy finish on the skin. this one dries down quite quickly even though it feels heavy at first. all in all, this is not for me, but maybe if you have an oilier skin type, the cream would work better foryou.",neutral
this has helped lighten my dark spots in an unbelievable way. i will definitely be repurchasing.,positive
it is a great oil. but i have no idea why people buy oils from a makeup company. buy them from organic oil companies. i get this exact oil.... for oz. same with marula oil about for oz. they are great oils but stop paying way too much for them.,neutral
"you need this product in your life! i was struggling with breakouts, texture and pigmentation for a while and noticed that the key to changing my skin was hydrating it! i love this serum and use it on wet skin.",positive
"unfortunately this product gave me the worst acne i have ever had in my life. just deep under the skin pimples. i was not sure if it was the product so i gave it some time and tried to combat it other ways, but when my friend said she had the same problem i stopped using it and bam acne cleared up within a couple weeks! just something to be aware of if you try! just not for me!",negative
this broke me out i have used hyaluronic acid in the past just not the inky list brand and i hated it,negative
"mineral sunscreens are known to have a thicker texture which makes it more difficult to apply. what i appreciate about this sunscreen is that it is super easy to spread across the face while leaving a minimal white cast. however, the downside is that it is really greasy-- i find dust particles and my hair sticking to my face.",neutral
"just ok. not the best. there is better on the market. plus, the smell is really strong.",negative
"so far my favorite cleanser! it does not make me break out further and over time has helped condense the amount of break-outs present. i have combinationacne-prone skin, and this works great for me!",positive
it was ok but i was disappointed. no more impressive than a cheap drug store moisturizer. i did not really see and drastic improvement in my skins overall moisture. the smell was unimpressive and it did not leave my skin feeling soft. just all around a let down.,negative
i really really wanted this to change my life. but unfortunately maybe my skin was too dry for it? my face was so dry and red with bumps all over it. i could not even finish the bottle. my skin is drysensitive so maybe it was just too much,negative
"i hate the new formula, it did nothing for my skin. the bottle is always getting clogged and previously it never did this. i have opened the bottle a couple times when it is clogged and it leaks within the container. overall just not as good and worth the money compared to before.",negative
"this cream has a really nice texture and i feel like i saw results after about a week, highly recommend to anyone with dark pigmentation spots.",positive
love this!! with just a little takes even dark makeup off and my face feels so soft after i wash it. so much easier than oily makeup remover.,positive
"this night cream is exactly what i was looking for. i am very particular about texture and this is the perfect balance between a gel and a cream. it is thick enough to where your skin feels nourished but light enough to not sit on top of it. it absorbs really well. if you like to stay away from fragrance this is not for you but if you do not mind, the scent is quite pleasant and fruity. i have sensitive skin and a lot of night creams tend to make me break out but i have not had a problem with this. it makes my skin plump and even in the morning. love it!",positive
"i have dry, acne prone skin. this is a great, lightweight moisturizer. it applies well under makeup, and it did not because me to break out! the only reason i did not give this product five stars is the price, but if it fits in your budget then you will probably enjoy it.",positive
i have oilycombination skin and i love this moisturizer. it is light and my skin rapidly absorbs it. i use it soon after i wash my face for better absorption. i have been using tatcha products for over months now and i am pleased with my skin for the first time. i have acne prone skin with lots of scars.,positive
"made my yr old face get a type of pimple, right near where i put the stuff, that i had not had since my s... i am now!! terrible and took weeks to go away... cannot even give a review of the darkness removal because i stopped using it.",negative
this is so similar to ordinary matrixyl serum but more lightweight texture. i like them both but ordinary one is just a little thicker and nicer to apply. still i have purchased this serum many times and have always been happy with the hydration i get. the trick is to apply is on slightly damp skin and seal it with thicker moisturizer,positive
i think this is an amazing hyaluronic acid serum. it plumps the skin up and always leaves it looking super dewy. it smells great but no overwhelming fragrances. my skin is acne-prone and dry patches this has been moisturizing and helped my skin tremendously.,positive
"i bought this product in the hope that i could do a double cleaning, but it was not possible. it does not melt makeup, no matter if it is water proof or not. the container is also inconvenient since where i live it is cold and i had to press very hard to get the product out and it broke at the tip.",negative
"it is a good mask, easy to apply and remove, no down time. however, not a lot of product for the price, there are more masks out there! i have been using this consecutively for about weeks, have not noticed much of a difference, but it feels nice?! saveyomoneyhoney",neutral
it is ok but as mentioned in other reviews this smells! it is very citronella candle... not something i want to smell wafting from my face. although the scent goes away after minutes i am left with minimal redness as i am guessing this moisturizer kind of triggers my rosacea. you could find better to be honest,neutral
"as someone with oily skin, this was not the product for me. it left my skin shiny and sticky. however when i put unseen sunscreen over it the shine did decrease. it also did not pill when layered. i think this is a great concept so hopefully they can figure out a way to improve the finish. i had no issues with the smell of the product.",neutral
it did not really absorb into my skin it felt like it was just sitting onto of my skin.,negative
so i have been using this product for about ten years and i have always purchased from paulas choice website or nordstroms. this was my first time purchasing from sephora since they began carrying the product. i just cracked open the bottle and i have to say it has a very odd smell that none of my other bottles ever had. i am a bit concerned. it almost smells like gasoline. this product should have no smell at all really. what gives?,neutral
i gave this magic cream stars. the packaging is a sturdy glass jar with a gold lid that looks great on any vanity. i think the cream is hydrating. it does have a mild fragrance so maybe not for super sensitive skin types. the package did not really state any additional skin benefits beyond being a moisturizer. for the price point i would have liked to see some extra benefits or multitasking product. it is a decent anti-aging tool to have on your vanity.,positive
"love this bb cream and i picked the perfect shade for me since i have a summer tan. i was a little worried about this product at first considering it claims to be hydrating and my skin is combination and more oily in the summer. it works amazing and my face does not get too oily at all and i pair it with a more mattifying primer to help with that as well. the texture is amazing and it blends perfectly! i also love the packaging and love that it has a pump as well, which makes it very easy to apply. it has amazing coverage for a bb cream, i just wish there were more shades available.",positive
"i love this product. it is got a cooling, soothing feeling. it is very gentle and goes on smoothly. i love most of freshs products and this one is definitely worth the price.",positive
was really hoping this product worked for me from all the hype but unfortunately it broke me out in places i never had acne. i understand it can cause your skin to purge but my skin was already under control before i bought it so i did not enjoy that. but it is a holy grail for a friend of mine so the only way to tell if it is for you is to try it out.,neutral
"returned these after one use. really wanted to like them, but the size of the patch was way too big to even target my dark circles! more of a cheekbone mask lol",negative
"my entire routine consists of tatcha, so i had high expectations. it melts instantly on your face and turns from a cream to a nice foamy texture. the one teeny tiny complaint i have is that it left my face feeling a bit tight and dry afterwards, which was disappointing since it is supposed to address dryness. maybe if you have combo or oily skin, it will work better. the tatcha deep cleanser did not dry me out at all, so i think in the end, i will be back to using that one after i finish this bottle. overall though, cleanses fairly well.",positive
gifted by innbeauty project such a fun product! i have been loving adding a glowy base to my makeup and this product is awesome for it. i would compare it to the charlotte tilbury flawless filter. it provides a great base layer for makeup and provides hydration! i would totally recommend this to anyone!,positive
"i wanted to like this, but it did not really impress me. it honestly feels sticky so i would definitely not recommend wearing it during the day. after a week and a half of use i did not notice anything different in my skin. i usually use serums from osmosismd that are more expensive but far outperform this one. if you are looking for something to really make a difference, personally i would spend a bit more money and get something that will really give results. the things i did like are the scent, it is nice and light, the packaging is pretty, though the bottle could be more compact for the amount in it, and i liked the pump dispenser as it worked beautifully.",neutral
"i really like this product but the packaging is terrible. i had to pry it open with a flathead screwdriver to get the last of the product out which was a lot. getting to the product was one thing, seeing how much plastic they use to make this packaging was embarrassing. in this day and age?! seriously?! branding a product clean and natural as a marketing device then selling it in a totally unnecessary amount of plastic that will be thrown in the trash when the product runs out in three weeks... what a shame.",neutral
i have tried a couple of tatchas cleanser and this one is by far my favorite. it is super gentle and does not feel like it is stripping my skin but still leaves it feeling super clean and smooth. would recommend.,positive
i am not a huge fan of facial oil. it is light weight and a little goes a long way. i do not use it everyday but a few times a week. it does have a smell that may be off putting to some but it did not bother me. the packaging is very nice and heavy.,neutral
"yea, i do not love that it pills up so badly on my skin.. also it is got like this fine gritty texture when you are applying it and it feels like it is exfoliating which is too much for daily use. also, when i first got it, it used to sting, which i read is normal, but i took a break and now it does not sting anymore so it is probably not very potent anymore. because i cannot use it everyday, i cannot use it consistently enough to see if it is even making a difference in my skin. not going to repurchase.",negative
"this product is amazing for dry irritated skin. if i use too much retinol or over exfoliate it soothes my skin immediately. it is thick and rich and works amazingly. i took of a star because it breaks me out if i use it daily, for me it is more of a treatment than a daily moisturizer",positive
i was sent this product for review from influenster though my review is honest. i was sent a ml sample size smaller then the palm of my hand. this only gave me about small uses. on the first application i noticed it left my skin feeling very smooth and sank into my skin very quickly. as someone who had more normal to dry skin this worked well. though i have been working extremely hard this year to take good care of my skin. i believe if my skin did not have the consistency of my skincare routine since january this would not of been a good moisturizer for me. i do not recommend this to anyone with very dry patchy skin. i do not know what the long term effects this moisturizer would have on my skin as i do not have enough product to test that.,positive
i have really sensitive skin and dry skin. for the first few days it was amazing but after i started breaking out. it feels great and you could feel the hydration but i believe my skin did not tolerate it. if you like smell in your products it is not for you.,neutral
caused local skin irritationredness without shrinking the pimple at all. would not recommend for sensitive skin.,negative
"this product is horrible. hardly removes, sticks back on face like glue.its like there is a shadow in my eyes i can",negative
i genuinely cannot tell a difference when i use this or not except that my makeup does not sit as well when i use this in the morning. i prefer other glow serums such as ole henriksen. definitely not worth the price tag.,neutral
"good product. i already have pretty even skin, i mainly use this to maintain. it is just a little too sticky for my liking, considering i have other vitamin c serums that are not sticky at all. definitely affordable though",neutral
not going to lie... this stuff is kind of funky but it is totally worth it. it looks and smells like you spilled red wine on your face and itchesstings a little bit the first few times you use it. once i wash it off though my skin feels extra soft and plump. i use it twice a week along with a few other ordinary products and my skin has vastly improved in the last six months or so.,positive
amazing! after weeks of using this product i feel like skin looks so much more plump and hydrated!,positive
"a little goes a long way with this product. it is very moisturizing yet it is very light. perfect for around the eyes. i have seen an improvement in dark circles and over the look of tiredness, my eyes look refreshed and well rested. i feel that it is worth the price, because it works and i feel that it will last a long time.",positive
"perfect for trouble spots, clearing trouble areas, and reducing pore size of the naturally large pores on my nose. i swear by this serum before any major picture-oriented affair.",positive
smells like seaweed. i could not continue using it because the smell bothers me and it was too late to return.,neutral
"this is one of the better serum-type products i have tried. i have very dry and somewhat dull skin but this leaves my skin looking glowy and smooth. i use this before applying moisturizer every morning. i would not recommend using it directly under foundation because it does tend to ball up a bit, but if you use a moisturizer or primer after this and before makeup it works great!",positive
easy to apply and remove. leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. has never caused me to breakout unlike some other cleansers i have tried. definitely buying this again.,positive
i really wish i liked this product more than i do. it is just not worth the price. it felt like it left a film on my skin more than hydrating it. for the cost and the amount you get vs what i felt i needed to use to get any sort of kind of hydration it is just not worth it. i do wish i liked this more,negative
"love it. my face was so dry, and now it is smooth and soft. this is my rd purchased. my favorite moisturizer.",positive
"due to all the rave reviews, i had been wanting to try this for a long time, but was hesitant because of the price tag. i was excited to receive a sample, but if i am being honest, i was very disappointed. i have oily skin, and i prefer a moisturizer that does not leave my skin feeling oily. this made my skin feel oily, which was a surprise being that it is a water cream. i much prefer first aid beautys coconut water cream, and it is almost half the price of this one. i will stick with fab!",neutral
"i have had this for about two weeks, and i definitely do love it. however, it is advertised as something you can use every day, and i just want everyone to know that this is abrasive when you wash it off. i would never recommend for anyone to use this more than- times a week. also would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin, because seriously the blueberry seed powder or whatever... not quite st. ives apricot scrub level but too close for comfort. if you use in moderation, it is a quick, fun mask that leaves the skin feeling soft and slightly moisturized. i do enjoy it, probably will not repurchase though.",neutral
i received this product from ipsy and started using it about a week ago. the color of the mosturizer was white. i noticed bumps forming all over my face!!!,negative
i love how it makes my face feels. i will repurchase again. i the face scrub,positive
"this product contains so many bad ingredients. even plastic! the killer for me is it contains mineral oil. i will not even buy a hand cream with mineral oil in it. it completely strips the skin and any tan you might have with it. it is one of the top worst ingredients to find in a product even if you wash it off. i was so excited to try this but i am so glad i read the ingredients first. please be cautious with all products, and read and research what is in them, because long term you may have it pay for it with your poor skin",negative
"i received the product free for testing purposes from influenster and jlo beauty. i used this wonder cream when i first got it ending of january stop because i notice i was getting breakouts i just recently used it for days now from- notice the same thing that it broke me out, i am not sure what is in this product but it does not mesh well with my skin, also i do not care for that strong perfume like, soap, rose, relaxer smell in this product they could have kept it out, if this as a perfume then ok but in this face cream it is extremely strong and lingers on the whole day night since this is a daily cream that it says you can use morning night which i did, i also did not like how thick of a product it is for a daily cream either and it also left a layer on my face after i would apply this on, when i would touch my face it would feel the thick residue on my face, it did leave my face glowy but that is about it, i do not think this was a moisturizing product either, i saw my face was glowy but it did not feel moisturizing or like the product penetrated my skin, i cannot test it is other claims for skin concerns due to in my opinion skincare products must be use for over a year to notice any difference and i only used this for days in the ending of january days in february, i will not continue using this because it broke me out not secretly but enough for me to notice the difference on my skin and to stop using it because i do not want it to give me more acne breakouts, i also do not care for the bulky unnecessary packaging, i feel like that is a waste of materials due to the product is only in the gold container, i would not purchase this face cream due to i have others in my collection from drugstore to high end that do a better job and do not break me out.",negative
love the packaging of this product especially the spout and how easy it is to apply. i tried this a few times but it seemed to cause irritation and breakouts. i will probably be giving it away.,neutral
very mild and non-drying. great for daily use on sensitive skin.,positive
"i decided to give these a chance but they did nothing for me, they did not remove nor help remove not one blemish since i purchased them in october, usually other brands have the white yucky stuff on the patch when you take them off these just feel like stickers on your face that just help cover it up. do not recommend.",negative
i got quite a bad cut on my cheek bone under my eye and when the scab healed it it left behind a quite noticeable dark mark. since it was in a pretty prominent spot right on my face i kind of freaked out lol so i bought this hoping it would help and i really think it did! the pic shows before and after a little over weeks of daily use. i used it at least once a day but sometimes morning and night. i have sensitive skin so i used it after my moisturizer and let me tell ya that might be my new secret to success- using actives on top of moisturizer cuz you still get all the benefits with none of the irritation! this has kind of an interesting texture it is a cream but somehow kind of stringy? i do not know how to describe it but it was not unpleasant to use at all. also it is going to last foreverrrrr i use about half a pea sized each time and the tube looks like it basically has not been used. it is quite pricey for me anyways but since hyperpigmentation was definitely my concern i am fine spending money to help fix it. if you have hyperpigmentation left behind by cutsacne etc. i would recommend giving this a go!,positive
"the price is great for a cleansing balm, and it did a good job of dissolving makeup. the oat particles provide a very gentle bit of physical exfoliation. the problem is that it does not rinse cleanly and leaves a film on skin. after using it for a week or so i noticed that i was getting some minor breakouts.",negative
it has a milky consistency and absorbs immediately. my skin feels moisturized and there is no sticky feeling so that is nice. i only wish they did not add fragrance in the serum because it is absolutely unnecessary.,neutral
i apply this twice daily around my nose where my pores are most prominent. when i applied on my entire face i got little white heads so just be careful to only apply to areas while large pores. this product has actually shrunk my pores unlike other products that make this claim but fail to give results.,positive
as an esthetician i am always trying new masks. this pore mask is one of the best i have tried on the market.,positive
the coolest product ever! it is completely clear and it was unexpected for a sunscreen. it reminds me of a primer and it is easy to apply during my morning skincare routine.,positive
"this product makes my skin look like it has a healthy glow when i apply it, but this does not seem to help reduce any hyperpigmentation as it claims to do so. if you are looking to reduce hyperpigmentation and dark spots, this product might not help. however if you are looking to make your skin look dewy and healthy, this will do the trick only has this appearance while it is on your skin, after you wash it off the glowing skin is gone. also... a little drop goes a long way, bc if you put too much on your face it will just look oily. overall might not buy again bc it did not help w the dark spots, but i do appreciate how dewy it makes my skin look when applied on my face.",neutral
i used this with the makeup wipes. this was an okay product. the wipes were dry and felt like i was spraying oil on my face and wipes were like paper towels. pass.,negative
where has this been all of my life?! i have always hated toner because it felt so stripping on my skin until i met this baby. i got a small one in the hydration dream team set and though i was skeptical...pressing this into my skin like an essence has changed my skin. my face is as soft as a babys bottom.,positive
"i am really trying with this product but its just not for me i guess. i used it on its own after cleansing for some time, then i tried with a serum underneath, then i tried it in combination with the adaptogen mist and i am just not getting enough moisture i do have very dry skin in the winter but several reviews and the product itself says for dry sensitive skin. once i put it on, the skin feels nice and moisturized but in just a couple of hours its dry, tight, flaky in some spots and i even have the feeling that my face is starting to look visibly worsemaybe due to dehydration. it may work better for me as a summer moisturizer but definitely not a good option for a canadian winter",negative
this product smells exactly like a drug store sun screen. nothing special. i was disappointed.,negative
"this must be a dream for very dry skin, but as mine is combo this is too much. it reminds me of the prebiotics sephora cream formerly called. which i love but this one is probably times thicker and feels harder to spread around for me.",neutral
"to begin, i would like to disclose this product was gifted complimentary from la mer in exchange for a review. i do not think this moisturizer is worth the money since their are so many other good moisturizers on the market for less than of the price. however if you have the funds it does feel nice and does leave you moisturized. i do wish this was more affordable for everyone to try. it is dewy and lays very well under makeup.",positive
"definitely glad i got a sample of this first. it goes on wonderfully and i love the way it feels and looks under makeup, however, it gave me little white bumps all over my under eye area giving stars because i think it would be amazing for someone else! if it would not have caused the bumps i definitely would have purchased it.",neutral
"was able to snatch this for off during a sephora sale. brightens my skin. no irritation. i have to shake well before using or else the product comes out very separated and a lot of oil leaks out, not sure if this is normal. after shaking, the product comes out fine. but because i need to shake it, i noticed a leakage in the back... so stars off for that because for this price point i do not want to waste any product due to the packaging. pictured is pump- i apply generously to my face and neck.",neutral
i love love love this toner. it is so lovely. i use it after i wash my face and it just feels so nice on my skin. i also love the smell of it. i have combination oily skin and the product works really well with it.,positive
"first time i used this product i pushed it all the way out of the tube and had no way to put it back in, so i got a new one, which proceeded to break me out immediately i was super disappointed",negative
"i received this in my sephora play box and was quite impressed. my makeup is glistening my the end of the day most days and this setting spray took it back about less oily. it is probably the best that i have tried aside from urban decay de-slick. the downside and reason behind the deduction of stars is because it leaves a residue in my hair and it is not appealing to have when you have dark brown to black hair. so, i just place a hand towel over my hair prior to spraying it over my face. it is also sticky if you do get it on your clothes.",neutral
i have been using this spray for about weeks and it certainly does what it is supposed to. it is hydrating and i use it morning and night as my toner stage. i wi say that i have not noticed much change in my skin aside from some breakouts that i do not usually get. i do not know if that is coincidence or something in this product causing it but i will give it some more time. i also find the smell pretty bad. i think there are better hydrating toners for this high of a price point.,neutral
"this product did not work for me. it made me breakout. i do not usually use cleansing balms so i gave it to a friend who does and here is her review.it did remove makeup but required more rubbing in to emulsify than other balms, the smell was a little weird medicinal. the texture was thicker and dryer than most balms, which is probably what led to the issue with emulsifying. the packaging was beautiful and sturdy glass and a little product goes a long way. it also did not sting skin, because skin or eye irritation like some overly scented cleansing balms do.",neutral
"love this gel based moisturizer. i have combination to oily skin and this helps. my forehead does not get as oily like it use to. my noise, not as much but still some oil honestly. smells great and very light weight. i spread very little across my cheeks and forehead and am good to go. it is a bit tacky after application but it goes away after a few mins and my skin feels very soft. i also love that it is green and clean at sephora.",positive
this did not work for me. my skin felt tight and dry after i used it.,negative
i was really really hoping this worked on my skin. i have had a sudden outbreak on my face and saw the good reviews for these dots. i used it two nights in a row hoping for it to kick in but it did nothing at all for my pimples. so sad that now i have to return them.,negative
"as someone with very sensitive and very dry skin that battles rosacea on a daily basis, this cream is a hard pass for me. received the full size in a quarterly subscription box and for transparency i did not use it on my face only applied to hands to patch test for irritation, but for a product targeted at my exact skin type i am honestly shocked that ren would include some of the most sensitizing natural fragrance ingredients specifically citronellal, geraniol, limonene and linalool and citrus oils in the formula that are well-known for being common irritants for people with sensitive skin. the smell of this cream is also incredibly pungent and gave me a headache after ish minutes of it being on my hands, and the smell did not dissipate until i washed the cream off completely. i will give credit where it is due though- my hands felt incredibly soft during the time i had this cream on them, and from prior experience with ren products i do not doubt that the formulation outside of the fragrant ingredients is perfectly fine- thus the two star rating instead of a one star- but i just personally cannot get over the smell or the inclusion of irritating plant extracts in a product targeted for sensitive skin to appreciate the aesthetic effect on my skin texture.",negative
"terrible texture, separates in tube, leaves film on skin....",negative
"it was not the miracle worker that i have heard about. i get one massive pimple per period. i had to use two nights in a row. the second night, when removing in the am, it broke open the skin maybe due to using two times in a row? but my skin has been less angry while healing than all my other pimples.",neutral
"i love this moisturizer. it is great for my acne prone skin, hydrates but does not clog pores.",positive
"i like this product i feel like it has helped with the fine lines around my eyes. i use it morning and night. however i am not happy that it did not come with one of those spoons all the other tatcha jar products come with. when i get the product out with my finger, so much product gets under my nails i feel like i am wasting half of the product.",neutral
it is an okay moisturizer honestly really nothing mind blowing. i just do not like it makes me feel greasy after half an hour. not going to repurchase i was disappointed seeing all the reviews that raves about it but yeah no for me,negative
no thank for some reason this breaks me out like crazy and now i am dealing with getting rid of acne and now acne scarring! this may be to thick for my skins or maybe my skin is to sensitive but it is horrible for me!,negative
"i have always seen people rave about this online. saw how much it was and thought, nope. but i later changed my mind and spent on a moisturizer. i ended up only using this two times and then had to take it back. it broke me out and the fragrance is too much for my sensitive skin. not worth it at all.",negative
"you get a good amount of product for the price point and for me to use on a regular basis would last a good while. i think the price point to product amount is very reasonable. the product is hydrating and felt very cooling when applied, especially on these hot summer days. i have dark circles and it was mildly brightening, i did not expect miracles in terms of concealing but it did help. would purchase again!",positive
"the product itself is great, i like the texture and consistency and it makes my skin look great.but...the refill does not actually go into the jar easily. and then the jar will not dispense lotion once you finally get it in. so i have to take everything apart every time i put lotion on my face. also, good luck getting sephora to take it back when you buy the original jar and refill as a set- i did not know about the issues until after their return period expired, so now i have a jar of unusable lotion.",negative
"i was really excited to try this daily peel, but it left me pretty underwhelmed. i do like the blend of acids both aha and bha, which are known to work together synergistically to better treat skin conditions like acne. what i really cannot wrap my head around is why this peel has dimethicone so high up in the ingredient list! especially for a leave on product, this seems really strange to me. dimethicone is typically used as a buffer or emollient in a cream formula, and it is known to clog pores for people who are acne prone.",neutral
"i wanted to like this as i read a lot of positive reviews and it has great ingredients. i tried using it at night and morning also use different method of using as indicated. it is just not working for me, my skin break out every time i am using this. i did use this as part of my steps routine.",negative
"i am afraid i will not buy this again. i generally like what it did to my skin. but the smell and the texture were too off-putting for this to make it into my regular rotation. thick, and oily with a burnt-tire smell. and i tried just using- drops at a time. my skin felt slick and oily all day. going to try a different product.",neutral
i received this product for free from influenster. really nice eye cream! i think this is a great moisturizing eye cream. a little bit goes a long way and it will sting if you get it too close to your lashes or corners of your eye. i also think it is very overpriced but it does work well!,positive
"pills horribly!! no matter the layering, dry down time, different combos with other makeupskincare, bare faced- nothing works. you rub your hand on your face any given time and pilling!! i am baffled how fresh does not know or address this fatal flaw. bummer!! i think i would love it if this did not happen.",negative
"amazing product!!! i was experiencing the worst breakout i have ever had in my entire years of life, in combination with a gentle cleanser this stuff saved my face!",positive
"absolutely love this product, i noticed a huge difference after i stoped using it. definitely cannot wait to go back to it. m",positive
"i love reapplying sunscreen with this! it does not move your makeup and since i am more on the oily side it reduces my shine, it is also very easy and convenient. i think that on some people it could look powdery. it is also a bit hard to know how much to put on to get the fully benefits of spf protection.",positive
"saw no difference- not worth the money, when you can simply use your face cream.",negative
the most delicious exquisite sensation that i experienced on my face is a viscosity a sensation of thickness like this delicious moisturizer and lubricant on your face i swear you want to smear it all over your body but it is only for the area under your eyes i do not know how explain to you how rich it feels on the skin the truth is that i have some parts with irritation and abuse if i put it there i would have wanted a larger sample because i have not had enough i am about to finish it because of the top exquicity it is,positive
"i have combinationoily skin, and it gives me that tightdrying feeling after washing. also, the gel consistency does not really lather up and it glides right off my foreo luna when i place it under running water. still looking for a good face wash with pump. will not be repurchasing as it has not done anything for my skin, even though it is pretty to have on my bathroom counter.",neutral
"i have been using this product for about a year and a half now. and i do have to say that the reviews are correct about you going through a bottle very quickly. keep in mind i am only using one pump for my entire face and neck spreads well. i think i have gone through- bottles this year alone, which is ridiculous for what you pay for a bottle x. i live in an extremely dry climate so my skin just sucks up this moisturizer, especially in the winter. this is both a good and bad thing, this moisturizer absorbs super quickly into my skin but it does not feel like it is completely hydrated after one use and eventually feels dry later in the day. this past winter my skin got very dry and i needed to use the fab salve to help. i do not know if my skin is too used to this moisturizer or the formulation has changed but it is not as effective and it used to be. considering this moisturizer is marketed to people with dry skin, i expect more of a moisturizing component to come from it.all this being said, this moisturizer is still one of my favourites. i have struggled to find a good moisturizer for my acne prone, sensitive, combination skin for years. but this moisturizer and this company are amazing for my skin type and have truly saved my skin. because of everything that this line has done for my skin, i will always be a loyal customer and will continue using this product.if you are looking for a moisturizer that has no scent and is safe for sensitive skin, look no further.",positive
savior for my dry skin! i have very dry skin and i live in florida so the humidity does help some. i went to georgia in the winter to visit my parents in the cold that always dries my face out terribly. this time i brought this cleanser and it was absolutely amazing it felt very luxurious and did not dry my skin at all. it was the first time i have been to visit my mom in the winter that my face did not get chapped. if you have dry skin i highly recommend.,positive
"i was a loyal user of the original formula and purchased the new version with high hopes. it is nothing like the original and does not blend well or last. it has a very strange texture and emphasizes dryness and fine lines, unlike the original formula that actually seemed to help these issues. will not repurchase and will cross my fingers they will reformulate back to the original.",negative
"it did not do enough for my hyperpigmentation or my dehydrated skin. i had to mix it with my moisturizer so the moisture could be sealed into my skin instead of being drawn out. again, maybe for someone with a different skin type, this could be a godsend.",neutral
writing a review after over years of using this and have been through multiple bottles. i love it. this was a game changer for my skin in terms of texture and balancing my skin tone. i use it only in the morning and right after applying it the redness instantly subsides and my dark spots under my eyes also do not look as dull anymore. i feel like this product definitely needs time to see the long term results but from first use i noticed the balancing of skin tone. definitely worth the money for older people or individuals who are looking to upgrade their skincare routine.,positive
"while i feel that this oil is hydrating, i cannot get past the extremely strong fragrance. it is almost overwhelmingly strong. i wanted to love this but i will not be continuing to use it.",neutral
i got a decent sized sample and have used only to remove eye makeup. it definitely works well to get it off and i did not feel like it left a greasy residue- i just rub it on and remove with toilet paper before washing my face. however it leaves my eyes super blurry which is a bit scary for several minutes and then they kind of burn afterward even using water. i also cannot stand that this is heavily marketed as a clean brand but they list polyethylene in the ingredients list which is a microplastic. definitely not clean or environmentally friendly. i will not be purchasing and will be double checking the ingredients on any other clean beauty at sephora.,negative
"pros i am fairly light and the color looked nice, the tanner itself makes my skin feel so, so soft cons it is so streaky- like comically streaky. i exfoliate, use lotion on my dry areas, etc. but i cannot manage to get this to come out even. wanted to love it, but sincerely could not.",negative
much better than the brightening dots! i did see a difference after one night. i probably will not order again but that is because there are cheaper dots with the same ingredients.,positive
good around lips too! love the convenience and the design. worth the price!!,positive
"this is a potent product. if you use it too much it will really exfoliate your undereyes and you will see peeling. i am not mad about the peeling because it exposes fresh skin. though it says to use it nightly, limit to times weekly to keep the peeling to a minimum.",positive
"was excited to receive this product i had high hopes considering the reviews i read, its ingredients list, and the price tag. unfortunately, i did not get the results expected. i suffer from some hyperpigmentation and was hoping this would help fade those areas, but it has not so far. i do enjoy the look of the bottle, as well as the lightweight, smooth texture, and gentleness on my sensitive skin. it is not sticky and a little goes such a long way. going to continue my daily use of this product with hopes that maybe my skin just needs a little extra time to see results!",neutral
"this is just ok for me. i love the ordinary and use many of their products religiously and to incredible healing effect. however this moisturizer does not wow me enough to change my brand. i do not care for this packaging, i find it difficult to get anything out of it, especially when it gets down to the dregs. it is a lighter consistency, spreads well and does not pill. i use purito though for my moisture. their deep sea water cream is divine, and their cica barrier sleeping pack are the best for my skin.",neutral
"i do not know if i got a faulty spray but it takes sprays to get the entire face and it is a very fine mist but then it leaks from the bottom of the spray nozzle. it got me tan, but i was kind of sticky and much prefer the isle of paradise drops or the dr dennis gross intense face glow pads.",negative
"i received this complimentary from a sample site and i do think it works well, but my sensitive skin was red for hours after use. i really would be careful with this stuff and if you have skin like mine, use it less than every day. my face really did feel clean afterwards, so i do think it is worth it for those with tougher skin!",positive
"this night time moisturizer feels clean on the face, soaks in skin with a scented lavender scent. no mess on pillowcases or sheets. my face feels soft with a clear hydration after a few days use.",positive
"i have been wearing this almost everyday since it arrived and it works well with the other products i use. after washing my face in the morning with just water, i put on the buffet or buffet copper as a first step. as it dries the surface of my face tightens in a good way, reducing pores and fine lines a bit. if i put on too much, it seems to stay a bit tacky. i have found that the tight layer of buffet almost helps to set my makeup, almost as a primer, than just my moisturizer alone le mer soft cream. then if i want a bit of a glow, i apply the laura mercier radiance primer. followed by either my fluid foundation dior backstage or one of many powder foundations i own. i have never had pilling or balling up of my multiple layers of products, and it wears well throughout the day. no complaints and will continue to use!",positive
pink cloud hydrated my skin immediately! a little bit goes a long way and the scent is nice and subtle. it leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. i received this product complimentary from herbivore.,positive
i have never tried a product like this before. i think i would use it on my body instead of my face.,neutral
"overpriced moisturizer, plain and simple. there are no ingredients that make it beneficial specifically for the eye area. applied nicely, and a little bit goes a long way- i received a free sample and it lasted me a month, so that is impressive. eye area felt nicely moisturized in the morning after application, but no extra nor special benefit that a regular moisturizer could not provide. if you are feeling bougie or want to indulge than go for it, but personally i will save my money and invest in other products with more impressive formulations.",neutral
"normally my face tends to turn red since i have rosacea, and my dermatologist has always recommended me to use sunscreen, since the sun or the hot weather causes me to get redder than usual, i have gone through so many different brands and the truth is that i have struggled so much... very greasy, very dry, it clogs my pores, my makeup drains, it causes acne, my cheeks are redder... well, i do not even want to remember, but i used dermalogicas sunscreen and i was fascinated, i can not believe all my worries disappeared, my skin is smoother and very hydrated, i use it under my makeup and it works very well, i feel that my face is protected enough from the sun, it is not greasy, no it clogs my pores, it does not because acne and, above all, my rosacea is not visible, i mean not at all red my cheeks. i love!! you are my number one sunscreen from now on.",positive
"this oil is so good and is beautiful under makeup. the only issue is the dropper. it completely broke. it seems to be a common issue from reading other reviews. you can fix it, but it will break again lol. it is quite annoying. i probably will not buy it again. i am sure you can find another oil just as nice with a working dropper.",neutral
i got this as a mini sample from another purchase. i was really excited as i am a vitamin c junkie and the mini was perfect for travel. i do not usually have any issues with scents or smells but this product smelled bad. i could not stand it. it was also quite oily so i can see it not being great for under makeup. if you are sensitive to smells skip this one.,neutral
looks cakey and dries out my under eyes. even when i apply plenty moisturizer before using. i would not recommend this product.,negative
i am astonished how little product is in this bottle even after removing the top and reaching what remains inside. purchased and almost goneusing according to directions. have no idea how effective it is. too little to tell.,negative
one of my favorite moisturizers. saves my skin during the wintertime. would absolutely recommend to a friend.,positive
i love this! it keeps my skin feeling great and it goes great under my other skincare products.,positive
"i love the texture and the way it feels when i put it on my skin. it also gives you a really pretty dewy-but-matte glow. unfortunately, it makes me break out, specifically on and around my nose. i am not the most breakout prone person, but i do have sensitive skin. so so so sad this does not work for me.",negative
"love the matte finish of this sunscreen with spf and made specifically for acne skin. i do not have acne concerns, however the sunscreen somehow make me breakout. so far i am loving this product which is very lightweight and formulated to be oil control. do not see the breakout i sometimes get from the sunscreen after using this product. would recommend to give it a try if you have acne concerns. i received this product as a free sample.",positive
"i do not think this was a good product for reducing dark circles. i received this product for free to try and review. i have been using this product daily for two weeks, i took a before and after photo and there is not a difference between the photos. i was not very impressed with this product. i did notice it made the skin underneath my eye feel more hydrated, but no difference in brightening skin. the product has a thick consistency. for the price, i would definitely not buy this.",negative
i was so excited about the refill but after inserting into the old bottle the pump does not work. had to return and buy a whole new bottle. very disappointed- hopefully skinfix resolved this issue,negative
"i totter between thinking i do not need to spend so much on skincare and actually splurging for tata, but within days of using this serum, i saw a very noticeable difference so much that i stuck to my tinted spf and dropped foundation. there are lots of comments on the scent of tatas products. i love it. i would recommend swinging by the store and using the testers to see if you dig the smell of tatas line- it is very subjective apparently- but i can vouch strongly for the efficacy.",positive
ok i want to give this serum a fair shot and this review might be pre mature because i have been using this for a bout a month in rotation with my retinol serum. what i cannot stand about this product is the smell.... i dread opening the tube because it always spills out so much right away. the smell on my face is so pungent and unpleasant. i am trying to power through the awful scent and hoping for some miracle results. so far i can see a slow improvement. just not sure if there is a better smelling product out there with the same results.,neutral
i enjoyed the watery consistency and but other than that i did not see any difference. i finished the bottle.,neutral
do not really feel that it did much for my skin. would recommend using a exfoliating peel before recommending this.,neutral
"first of all let us talk about the struggled with vitamin c in the past, they are far too sticky, they often irritate my skin or simply just do not work, but let me tell you after using this serum i saw my skin deeply hydrated and prepared for the day. i really love it, i have been using this product for a few days now and i have never seen the results in a very short time before, until today with this wonderful product, i really like how it absorbs very nicely and the texture feels very smooth and looks very luminous, it does smell like ginger-turmeric to me but fades quickly. i use this every morning and night time. gifted by herbivore",positive
"this product is an actual holy grail. i have problematic skin that is relatively unpredictable. dealing with severe hormonal breakouts cystic acne, sensitivity, pregnancy induced hyperpigmentation, as well as frustratingly uneven texture and perserverant white bumps on my chin and around my nose i have honestly tried it all. blue tansy leaves my skin feeling soft, helping to regulate my oil production in a way that does not leave my skin dry or sensitive. in fact, this product is so gentle i have been able to use it on a nightly basis, with maybe one or two rest days mind you, i am no stranger to acids! this instantly soothes inflamed skin and reduces redness to a significant degree, and the same goes for blemishes and scarring. the texture of my skin had evened out after nights of use, and my complextion was like glass. it honestly does it all, and i could not recommend this product enough. i would say this would even be a great introduction product to acids, and in terms of my current love affair- the only ahabha product worth using. honestly, i am so addicted my other acid masks are collecting dust. definitely will repurchase, again and again.",positive
made me breakout i had completely clear skin before and within several days of using this i started to break out. also irritation on my neck. sucks because i really wanted to like it and i love all their other products,negative
love this it does not break me out. unlike other sunscreen.,positive
"this product did not correct my complexion at all. it is just zinc, basically. i could get the same geisha look using paint.",negative
"meh. i have used the entire container before writing this review. they feel nice while you have them on- very cooling, but i did not notice a difference in fine lines, wrinkles or hydration.",neutral
i have seen results in a couple days. i apply morning and night. just need- drops. i have a very sensitive skin dry and itchy. it helps a lot to calm that,positive
"if i could give zero i would. hated this! so thin it is like water and always drips no matter what. also, i shake it and still does not leave an even tan.",negative
i do not know if it is just my skin but this absolutely does not work for me. i have been trying to use this for a little over two months and every time it actually makes my acne worse and has given me one scar. i follow instructions to a t and definitely have not used it on open skin at any point. was really disappointed because it came highly recommended,negative
very good for its price but it is supposed to be a serum which is concentrated and the first ingredient of this one is water meaning it is not concentrated. it provides a nice moisture to my face and does not break the bank.,positive
"i am almost halfway through this bottle and am unlikely to reorder. i love the ingredients, the texture and how well it rinses off without having to use a washcloth. however, the major caveat is that is stings my eyes so badly that i have to make sure it goes nowhere near or else i cannot see. even trying to use it to get rid of concealer under my eyes is problematic, and it really cannot be used to get rid of eye makeup, which was a major reason i wanted to try an oil cleanser.really disappointed in this aspect of the cleanser, because i love products with squalane and overall it is a fantastic cleanser.... but the fact that i cannot use it as an eye makeup remover when it is a cleansing oil... that says it is ophthamologist is very disappointing. alas my search for a cleansing oil that has a clean-ingredient list and does not require a clean cloth for every removal continues...",neutral
this product is so good i just love using this every morning and night,positive
"great for oily skin that is also sensitive. leaves you feeling clean but not tight. i love this mask, and it is not messy",positive
"i had such high hopes for this with all the amazing reviews, but sadly, this did not do anything for me.",negative
". stars, for the marula oil which is a nice, really pure, clear as glass consistency oil that soaks in like a dream... and the pinky size bottle seems to never run out. the baby facial though is so not worth the hype. i have normal type skin and am south asian by background- i have been doing chickpea flour masks for a long time. you do not need this facial to get the same effect you can get by just simple using a bag of chickpea flour. it also burns more than i would prefer, the glycolic acid content is way to high to be good for normal year old skin. i can see this potentially working for people with combo and oily skin as it is very purifying. then again, since before my grandmas my family has been using the chickpea face mask trick and it does not come with this price tag. i do applaud de for using generation tested ingredients and techniques and will try some of their other products.",neutral
"love how gentle and non drying this cleanser is! the dual cleansing is a cool feature. be sure to follow the directions and apply to damp skin and shake thoroughly before applying. the smell is nice and subtle and the consistency is a bit watery, it is a milky cleanser. i always use a makeup balm prior to cleansing so i am unable to verify it is ability to remove makeup on it is own. but as a second cleanse it is a lovely experience.",positive
"this product is okay. when applying this product on a cotton pad and applying on my face, it gives a weird soapy texture, which i have never experienced from any toner. it does make my face feel clean, but i have not seen much difference in my skin. will not be purchasing again, but it is not a bad product. definitely reccomend the ole henriksen toners because they are around the same price and i see more of a difference with that product than this one.",neutral
"this product made my skin look so oily after use. i really wanted to love it as the texture is amazing and it feels great when putting it up but twenty minutes after putting it on with no make up on top, my face was so oily",negative
i gave stars because it has a very orange tint to it and that is not what i was looking for i was looking for a bronze tint! but it is very easy to put on with your moisturizer and overnight you have a tan poof,neutral
"this is a really nice product overall- i love the rich texture that can be used all around the eye. it is surprisingly hard to find an eye cream designed to be used on the eyelid in addition to the under eye area! i have not noticed a different in eye brightness, unfortunately, but it is a really soothing and nourishing eye cream nonetheless.",neutral
i really wanted to love this product especially after hearing everyone raving about. i bought it thinking it would help with my hyperpigmentation slight texture but it did not. i purchased it back in april so i gave it a fair chance but unfortunately it was trash for me at least. i would break out every time i put it on my face. the only good thing about this product is the price it is really inexpensive.,negative
"when using this product i did notice a difference to the applied area every time. my skin did not feel dry on applied area and a little of it went a long. however, i am not sure if it is my favorite acne treatment. i need to use it more",neutral
i bought this as a less expensive dupe of the drunk elephant cleansing balm. it removes makeup just the same. i took away a star for the packaging. this would be better in a jar with a scooper than a squeeze tube. it is very thick and hard to squeeze and a lot of product is left in there that you just cannot squeeze out towards the end of the product. i cut it with scissors and keep it in a bad to use all of the product.,positive
this completely dried out my skin.,negative
i use this for double cleanse. it really washes the makeup out very well. this is a gentle product and the texture takes some getting used to. i use this daily as part of my skincare routine. it leaves your skin soft and supple. i would highly recommend this product!,positive
i received this product for free to test and have been in love with it! to start the scent is heavenly. not overly fragrant and something you look forward to putting on your skin. i love how thick the products is and how soft my skin feels after applying it. i highly recommend to help fight the harsh winter cold!,positive
it smelled amazing and made my face feel really nice but i did not notice any difference.,negative
"i was disappointed in this face wash. it did not cleanse my skin at all. i have been using it for a couple of weekshave not purchased another cleanser yet and after toning, i am still removing oil and dirt. it did really well to remove makeup, which would be great for a double cleanse method. you definitely need another cleanser after using this one.",negative
"pros-fantastic formula, absolutely weightless on your skin, smooth, does not pill and is not sticky at all once applied which i love.cons-packaging flakes on your hand-sunscreen erupts out of container no matter what method i use to open it. tapping the base on a counter does not help. shaking it and letting it settle does not help. refrigerating the bottle, shaking it up and tapping the bottom on a counter does not help. you have to squeeze the sides aggressively so that sunscreen does not come squirting out of the bottle every time you open it and you cannot let go until you put the cap back on because for some reason it erupts every time. i had to transfer it to a small silicon travel container.",neutral
nothing special. not worth the price. i have used cheaper eye creams with better results. no difference with brightening or smoothness.,negative
"amazing serum. recommend for everyone. glowing, hydrating and just amazing. does not dry out the skin, or irritate. works week.",positive
this is amazing my skin feels so nice after i use it super soft and smooth. this also does not irritate my skin at all and i have really sensitive skin i would totally recommend this to everyone. the one downside of this is it can make your face a little bit oily which could be just my skin since i have super oily skin. but i love this and it is super nice to use!,positive
"i was so excited for this because the price point was great and i hear great things about the ordinary. it was hydrating, however i got a loooot of breakouts. like a clump of pimples on my chin and small white heads on my forehead and cheeks. i stopped using it for the last days and my skin finally is going back to normal. i am pretty disappointed and i do not want to waste the product, but i do not want continued breakouts.",neutral
"it is been my holy grail for years now, definitely the best toner everrrr! i truly do not know what my skin would do without it. the toner keeps my skin looking as flawless as possible",positive
"great product, i use it as a deodorant and to exfoliate my elbows as well. they need a tamper seal because it always spills when it arrives. i would not feel comfortable using it on my face for that reason as it could be contaminated. sephora does a great job resolving this issue but i feel bad. honesty all it takes it to add a tamper seal to prevent liquid from spilling during shipment.",neutral
"i have been using this product everyday for weeks and have not noticed any positive changes in my skin. to the contrary, my pores seem more congested. considering the price, i expected at least minor improvements to my skin. also, it has very strong perfumey fragrance. the fragrance goes away quickly, but i am not a fan of putting perfumed products on my face.",negative
not for dry skin. this does not act like a moisturizer at all on my skin. if i put this on at bedtime my skin would be dry by the morning.,negative
i have combo skin and was looking for an intense nighttime moisturizer for my face. received this as a recommendation and woke up to dry skin. did not provide the level of moisture i was looking for.,neutral
"i am a fan of huda, and her beauty products... however, i went into trying this scrub a bit skeptical. i feel like skincare sometimes comes with a millions claims of what it is going to do for your skin, so i was trying it out with low expectations, but definitely open minded.honestly, i was pleasantly surprised. it made my skin feel so soft, and smooth. my skin looked brighter even after just one use... which i definitely was not expecting. after using it for a couple of weeks i have noticed that my skin has consistently been clearer, and brighter than it is ever been. it dry out my skin either which was nice. i really ended up liking this product. honestly, i wish i could afford to use it all over my body.it has a nice, soft citrus scent that i really like. it is a bit messy, so i would suggest using it over the sink.",positive
made my skin feel gross and dirty after use.,negative
"i love what is inside but am very unhappy with packaging. it seems a little outdated and very environmentally unfriendly. it is hard plastic and cannot be squeezed to get product out. i hope they re-package at some point, until then i will not be re-purchasing.",neutral
"i have used lots of different cleansers before, this is definitely one of my favorite but not the greatest value out of them all, that is the only drawback i would say about this product, but when you look at the ingredients list, it makes sense why its priced higher than similar products",positive
it is a good sunscreen... it is affordable and it gets the job done. but it is thick and not my favorite form of spreadability and it smells strongly like sunscreen. i feel kind of clogged when i put on the proper amount because it is just so heavy. i think there are better and even more affordable sunscreens but this one is not bad,neutral
i use this as a first cleanse only on the places i have blackheads or other acne. i leave it on for s-min before washing it off with the inkey list fulvic acid cleanser. i have never used a product this effective at removing blackheads pore strips never worked great for me- also they are bad for your skin. it literally wipes all of the blackheads away. i do not find it drying but i keep it to problem areas only. a little goes along way so it lasts a long time if you are not using it everyday. recommend to everyone struggling with acne.,positive
i have very oily acne prone skin also covered with pitted scars and after the first use of this the oiliness is gone. i use it at night and the next day i am totally oil free and it dried up any current acne i had without over drying. my skin feels very balanced and clear!,positive
i have a double cleanse routine and a cleansing balm is a necessity. this is so thick and leaves a film. it is a no for me!!,negative
"i wanted to love this because it smelled good and felt so moisturizing.... but as someone who has maybe had pimples in my entire life, it took less than weeks before i went to bed one night with it in and woke up covered it zits all over my cheeks. as an actress, i am visible to a lot of people and i have been hiding in my house all week, taking allergy relief pills, throwing out things, washing makeup brushes and applying neosporin or hydrocortisone cream to my face. mortified and in tears. will not be buying anything from this company ever again",negative
i received a complimentary sample of this product and am so happy i was able to sample such an awesome serum! i have always been a fan of vitamin c in products but did not always like how it came with an artificial citrus scent. this is one of the few serums that i actually enjoyed the smell of and truly works. double bonus- this also comes with a hyaluronic acid so it helps your skin look brighter and feels smoother. i definitely recommend it for anyone looking to add a vitamin c serum to their skincare routine!,positive
"i was excited to give this vitamin c lactic acid serum a try, as i often hear good things about ddg. i honestly did not notice a huge change in any of my dark spots or fine lines, but hopefully with longer use i will begin to see more results. i am not a fan of the scent- it is very strong and just strange. overall, for this was just okay for me.",neutral
i used this product three times. i was curious after seeing it on youtube reviews. i like the packaging with the frosted glass. there is no weird scent to the product. when i put this on i noticed my skin was a bit red but nothing too crazy and used a moisturizer afterwards. i used this product every other day to give my skin a break but i noticed every time i use this product my nose area gets super dry like it started flaking. and it does not look cute under makeup. i knew it was this product since all the other skincare products i used before. my skin is not sensitive at all i used glycolic acid and retinol. i would personally recommend trying the dennis gross peels over this product. i find with that product you notice a difference after usage compare to this. will be returning this,negative
"i wanted to love this product. ever since getting the coola spf mister, i have loved the idea of a spray spf you could apply over makeup, but wanted something with more spf than the coola version provided. i bought this from seeing it on instagram, but it is so incredibly greasy and that is coming from someone with already very dry skin and also started to burn my eyes after an hour or so when the product was clearly starting to get in to my eyes. could not wait to wash my face. had high hopes, but this was not it.",negative
"there are pros and cons to this cleanser! this cleaner i believe is a game changer for someone who needs a morning cleanser or someone who is a no makeup- light makeup person but if your someone like me who is a medium- heavy makeup person then this is not for you. it barely removes your makeup, you use way too much when washing your face and you end up not feeling like your face is fully cleaned.",neutral
makes me break out goes on heavy and i get white pimples all over. wish it had worked.,negative
"this product has sulfates. i thought since it had the clean at sephora label it was verified sulfate free. i have a sulfate sensitivity, went to re-read the ingredients after my skin started itching. sulfates are in the ingredient list. should not be labeled clean at sephora.",negative
"loved this sunscreen! it was light weight, absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving white streaks, smelled good, blended well under makeup, and controlled oil and shine.",positive
wow these are so good. i rubbed them over a very deep pimple on my back and it completely shrunk it overnight. and i also rubbed it over my chest where i had some smaller pimples and it took those away also. i will be buying these from now on. these are the real deal here ladies!!!,positive
i like this collagen liquid- it is not sticky on my face and absorbs very nicely. i also like that it does not pill when i add my usual moisturizer on top. my only complaint is that there is no suction when i use the drop and it is too thick to just shake out. i have to wipe the product on my palm which i hate doing because i do not want it to get dirty.,positive
"i love the way this feels on my skin it makes it so juicy, and the smell is also lovely. i have repurchased this multiple times now and i cannot be without it. i use it as the first step of my night time routine following up with a moisturizer and eye cream.",positive
"i am obsessed. i was using an oil cleanser before this and purchased based on the great reviews esp since it is a brand new product! and wow it takes everything off does not make my face feel that weird squeaky clean feeling. the smell would be the only thing i do not love but it is bearable. honestly, i will not be using another cleanser ever again! soap free, sulfate free and cruelty free... take all of my money",positive
"i really am enjoying this day moisturizer. i received it as a complimentary gift from rose md skin and have used it for the last few days. i also appreciate that it has vitamin c in the formula as well! overall, recommend. gifted by rose md skin",positive
"received it in a birthday perk set from sephora, used it up and enjoyed it. it did not make any difference in my skin other than just moisturizing and i have normal skin, i do not think it would work for oily or extremely dry skin types. this and the cleanser that came in the birthday set were first products i tried from de and i am not impressed, for the price of full size i would expect wonders on my skin.",neutral
"this peeling solution is amazing. since the first use you are going to see great results. if you have sensitive skin start using it once every days and then once per week. there is no other product like this, and specially for the price it has.",positive
"absolutely love this product! second time buying it, just put my third one in my cart and thought i would write a review. it does not strip my skin unlike many other cleansers do especially those with ahas, bhas etc. and it really helps keep my black heads in check.",positive
this is truly the best moisturizer i have ever used! i received the sample size in one of my packages and as soon as i tried it out i knew i had to buy the full size. this is not container has lasted me months. a small amount of product really goes a long way. though it is expensive- the quality and amount of use you get out of it is totally worth the price.,positive
so i ordered this online- and bad on me for not looking at the amount in the bottle- and thought there had been some mistake when i received this. i thought i had gotten a sample size by accident. this is the tiniest little tube of product. if it performs miracles then maybe it will be worth it but for a tube of colloidal oatmeal ointment- which is pretty much what aveenos products are- this feels like such a ripoff.,negative
"this is the best one done nighttime product has become a staple for me for the last years!! when i do not have the energy to do a multi step routine at night, i will use only this after double cleansing and my face still feels hydrated so supple in the morning. it is just thick enough without being too heavy and melts right into your skin, and just a little bit of product goes a very long way so it is worth investing in! the scent is also very light for those who are typically sensitive",positive
"combo skin here--i get oily in my t-zone and desert dry or normal everywhere else. i had tried the sample kit for this and other tatcha dewy products and it got me so many compliments that i caved in and got a full size container. now, that it is no longer winter, this cream almost backfired in the summer heat. it clogs my pores but makes me glow. it is like i cannot have both a smooth, poreless face and a glow with this cream. i am going to skip a repurchase on this one, but if this is minor to you, treat yourself to a jar.",neutral
works great as an eye cream but does minimal for under eye circles.,neutral
"very creamy and clingy to the eye, it really smooths the fine lines! a little goes a long way.",positive
it is below average at best. it is expensive for what it is. i do not find it works very well and the texture seems rather drying. wish i liked it more. i would say do not buy,negative
this lotion moisturizes a bit but even cheap drug store lotion does a better job. the worst part is that it dries weird. it leaves a matte finish that accentuates my pores and fine lines. i look a few years older when i use this.,negative
"i received this products for free from influenster and nuface in exchange for my honest review. getting my nuface mini to connect to the app took a while. when i was finally able to get it connected and going, i really enjoyed using it. the size makes it easy to hold and comfortable in my hand. it is a fun addition to my skincare routine, however i have not noticed a huge difference in my skin. i have only been using it for about weeks so hopefully i will see more lasting results the longer i use it.",neutral
dislike this product!!! i am live supergoop but this one was not for me!! sadly it is very oily i do not like that,negative
smells good.. but is a bit too much for my skin. started to clog my pores and make skin finely bumpy,negative
"i wish there were more product in the bottle. i felt cheated in how much product i actually received, not to mention the dropper did not suck up much product either. as for performance, i really noticed a difference pretty quickly regarding my dark spots. which is unfortunate because i do not think i will be repurchasing because the packaging was terrible. many other products out there that work just as well, if not better, that provide you with better packaging!",negative
really not a fan of this cleansing balm. it is hard and chunky and really difficult to work withdissolve. after i use it if i wipe my face on a towel makeup is still coming off. the clinique cleansing balm is way better!,negative
it made my skin burn red. i also saw breakouts after using it. do not recommend.,negative
did not like. it has all these fabulous reviews but it actually made my redness worse.,negative
"because i have oily skin and use retinol i was specifically on the search for a high spf, with niacinamide, water resistant, and preferably a mineral sunscreen. it was great to find all of requirements in one product. i did not want to like this due to the price but i absolutely cannot deny the tatcha silk sunscreen feels ultra smooth, is skin softening as well as actually smooths my skin in preparation for my foundation. it looks marvelous and i enjoyed it on bare skin as well without getting oily all day. i am medium dark and it blends wonderfully with my complexion. if you do not want to spend dollars on a sunscreen do not tempt yourself with this one because once you have tried it, it is so beautiful you will not be willing to go back.",positive
"honestly disappointing. i was so excited to get this, and had tried the sample in store on my hand so it initially seemed ok. it was not. the next day, eager to try it on, and after applying my makeup i spritz twice onto my face.. it was super heavy. pleasant smell, but just very greasy and icky sensation that stays on your face all day.. additionally, i tried it on without any makeup and it was still horrible. like it was leaking out of my pores. had to return.",negative
"i have been using it for two weeks and i strongly dislike it. it lathers up so nicely, but the smell is disgusting and it is way too stripping. i also have been breaking out after using this. overall it has just not worked for me. i wish you better luck. if you do buy get mini size so you are not stuck with a big bottle. i will stick with my cetaphil thank you very much.",negative
first day using itsmells good left my face feeling a little sticky i will review again in a week,neutral
"great results and affordable price! way to go inkey for making an amazing product that everyone can afford! i have paid ten times the cost of this product for retinol treatments that did not perform nearly as well as this! my new must have! goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and no irritation. will definitely repurchase and keep this in stock at my house. i use this along with the collagen booster serum and the hepta peptide serum and my skin has never looked better!",positive
"i used to use the de retinol and it worked wonders for me but then i got pregnant and retinols became a big no for my skincare routine. my pregnancy brought me good skin but after giving birth, my skin turned dull and uneven in texture but i cannot go back to retinols just yet because now i am breastfeeding, so i tried vit c and ahas but nothing seemed to work then this product came up when i was researching and it was the best serum ever. indeed glowing skin and it brought brightness and smoothness to my face. i will purchase another bottle and continue to use it even after breastfeeding.",positive
"so, this cream really made my eyes water. i have never had that happen before with an eye cream. i gave it two stars because i do think it kept my under eye moisturized but that is all i can say for it. i returned the product.",negative
"the serum feels almost like a gel, but lighter. it feels cool on your skin and moisturizing, but dries pretty quickly. it has no scent, but i almost wish it did have a slight scent to it because i could still smell something-- it is just not that pleasant. it is not too overbearing though. i cannot speak to the long term effects because i have only been using it for a few days, but so far, no irritation on the skin and it feels nice. i received this product for free from influenster and jlo in exchange for my honest review.",neutral
"i wanted to give this stars but it broke me out. the first week of using it my skin was plump and dewy. but over tile my pores close i got forehead break outs and blackheads all over my face. it is not non comedogenic, which means it can clog your pores. sucks i really wanted to love it it is smells good my skin felt nice aside from the breaking out.",negative
"this did nothing for me. i was very hopeful that i would see results because it caused my skin to purge. however, after the purge this product did nothing for me. i tried it all over my face and as a spot treatment and it did absaloutly nothing. i also feel that it caused my skin to become more oily. i ended up returning the product.i think that this product is definitely worth a shot, since there have been so many positive results, but just be aware that it may not work. things i liked about this product were the scent and that a little goes a long way.",negative
the worst breakout acne ever!,negative
"this feels heavy on my skin. i am normally super dry, but this makes my skin feel greasy and oily. i have only used it a couple nights. maybe i will change my mind. for now, it makes me feel moisturized, but greasy.",neutral
"i am really picky with my moisturizers so i tend to try a lot of samples. i received this as one and it was not too bad, but definitely not for me. i really dislike the consistency. it is more gel than cream. seems to moisturize ok, but what really turned me off was at the end of the day, if i touched my face i could feel pilling. being the only new product in my rotation, pretty this moisturizer was the reason. while it is great for a lot of other people according to the reviews, definitely not for me.",negative
not recommend for dry skin. it added lots of texture to my already textured skin while just sitting on the surface of my skin.. it does not absorb into the pores.,negative
they some what did their job on my cheeks but everywhere else on my face became very dry. even when you seal the package the pads became dried out.,neutral
"i wanted to like this after reading good reviews, but it left my face feeling sticky. not a fan",neutral
"i have used the other products in this line and loved them. until now- this bronzing water mousse is better. way better. color is better. no mess ups in my application. color is really better. i love,love, love it. nice olive-toned color, no sheet stains, no clothes stains. this is the best stuff!!!",positive
the ingredient list looks good but this stuff lights my face up every time i have tried it. and not in a good way cystic acne city. i have not had any luck with any drunk elephant serums and honestly find the brand as a whole to be totally over rated.,negative
"so i bought that hanni razor and it completely destroyed my legs. it bled soo much and my boyfriend was horrified and i had like bandaids all over my legs for days. the scabs turned into dark scars because my skin is super fair and everything turns into a scar on me apparently. i have been using the faded cream for a- weeks and they have gotten so much lighter i think they will be hardly noticeable in another weeks. i originally got a small tube in a boxycharm and forgot about it until the hanni incident. i came back for the larger tube after buying the spray, which left orange splotches all over. anyways, this stuff works. i use it every day after i shower and i highly recommend it. also i am sticking with waxing these days",positive
"i hate that this did not work for me.... i really love the feel of it and how truly unseen it is... however i think it is clogging my pores because i am getting breakouts- if it was truly non-comedogenic, it would be a keeper",negative
"everyone is skin is different obviously, i always struggled with acne and acne scars it was really bad, and since i have been using this my skin has never felt so soft and looked so glowy ever, my acne scars are still there but there is a difference, they are fading, buying this again!",positive
"i bought this eye cream in hopes that it would help with the dark circles under my eyes. it has helped improve them a bit, but nothing drastic-- though i am not surprised by that, there is not much you can do about them since the skin is so thin in that area.what i do love about this cream is the applicator! the metal tip feels so soothing along the delicate undereye area. the cream itself is soothing and light. overall, this is a great eye cream for the price.",neutral
"this is okay, but if you have normal or combination skin i would not recommend. it is super greasy and clogs my pores a bit. i live all the other products from the dewy collection but this one just does not work for me.",negative
"it made me break out. i wanted to love it. it has so many pros great consistency, thick but not greasy. light pleasant scent... i had to discontinue use. it is maybe better suited for people with dry skin that is not acne prone.",neutral
"maybe it works but the perfume triggers an allergy response so it is super hard for me to use it. if fragrance bothers you, skip this product. i will not re-order",neutral
replaced my water cream with this and i am pretty disappointed. i see no additional hydration but my skin is going crazy right now and this is the only thing i have switched. i have acne like i have not seen in years. i do not see improvement in any way. i am going to continue using and hope that my skins just adjusting but i did not have this issue with the luminous dewy concentrate or water cream. if you are on the fence i would recommend the water cream over this.,neutral
"personally, i thought gel moisturizers worked better for combooily skin, but i was wrong. i had been using a cream moisturizer before this product, which was working well for my skin. i used this moisturizer, and i could tell that my face was significantly more oily. by the way, i was using herbivores pink cloud moisturizer, and i am still using it",negative
horrible! the color is way too deep for my skin not their fault as i am very fair but no where near as light as they indicated and very yellow. the product felt worse than most mineral spf just sitting on my skin like an uncomfortable itchy mask. it looks like i am wearing cake makeup!,negative
"this is a fine cleanser, but i would not say it provides a deep cleanse. i bought it to supplement my regular routine on days when i need a little extra but i think it is better suited as a daily cleanser than a deep cleanser. but it is nice and gentle and does not dry out my skin. the cleanser itself is probably four stars, but it loses another star for the terrible packaging which is a squeeze bottle with a giant opening and makes it hard to control the amount that comes out. i will use up this bottle but will not be buying it again.",neutral
"uncomfortable, greasy. i agree w the other comments about your skin feeling congested. so glad i got the small jar. would not recommend",negative
"i cannot lie, i initially loved this product when i first started using it because it did seem like it was keeping my acne in check... at least on my face. over time it caused me to break out on my neck somewhere i would never once had a pimple appear on in any place it would drip down onto. i tried to be really cautious but it was too much of hassle to worry whether or not i would get a little bit of face wash on my neck. my other issue with this cleanser is that it is extremely drying. after cleansing, your face will feel like every bit of moisture it once had has been completely stripped off. and the drying feeling lasts even after moisturizing.",negative
"helps with dry skin sooooo much, its absolutely amazing, and does not leave skin too oily!",positive
so worth it! literally shrunk my pores after days of use. my skin is glowing and it wiped away any texture. also noticed that my acne scars have faded tremendously!,positive
"so moisturizing without be greasy! nice scent that is not too overwhelming. i am always nervous to try new moisturizers but this one was great. it absorbs well, but leaves a soft dewy finish and plumped, very hydrated skin.",positive
"this product almost destroyed my skin. i had very little acne before using this, and after, i am more broken out than ever.",negative
i wish i could give this a full review but i unfortunately got milia around my eyes a couple days into using this so i stopped immediately. but i feel like it felt nice during the days i used it!,neutral
"this toner is so hydrating, smells amazing and really feels cooling on the skin. i have parched skin that really drinks this up. i am honestly not a fan of this line in general but an esthetician recommended this toner to me and it is unreal how great it is. my skin in conjunction with other hydrating and smoothing products has never been so glowy and even. i love this stuff.",positive
"i usually use drunk elephant protini polypeptide year round with no issues but decided to try this lighter moisturizer for the summer. for reference, my skin is super oily and i have large pores. i have been using this product daily for about a month.overall. feels nice and cooling on the skin, but can take a few minutes to sink in. the smell is not terrible, but could be better. not good for oily skin, it made me shinier throughout the day but who knows, maybe that was just my skin adjusting. this did not make me breakout or because any reactionsconclusion will not be repurchasing for my skin, but highly recommend sampling this to see if it works for youif it does not sink in, it is probably because you are using something underneath with a larger molecule size or you are using too much. i was using the niacinamide zinc serum underneath and would have to wait a few minutes for that to sink in before i could apply this moisturizer.",neutral
"my face feels so oily after using it. and it does not remove your makeup completely. more important, i cannot get the product out of the stupid tube. the product is so hard, it actually broken the tube after two uses. a waste of money.",negative
"this product did not work for me at all. i used my rewards to try it out and just from putting it on for a day, it completely destroyed my skin. from when i first put it on i noticed it was not being absorbed into my skin and it just left my face oily, but at the end of the day i noticed a lot of little pimples forming all on my forehead, on my chin, and around my mouth. i also had several forming in my cheeks and i never get acne in those areas. i am sure this product is great for other people, but unfortunately it did not work for my skin.",negative
"did not really do much for me personally, i just found that it made me more oily",negative
"really wanted to love this sunscreen, but unfortunately, it burns when i sweat or accidentally get it in my eyes. definitely gives a nice glow underneath makeup, but not worth the stinging. my skin did not like this one... not for sensitive skin. i much prefer their unseen sunscreen!",neutral
i was expecting more but this one is pretty okay. does not do much for me and i do not like how it smells,neutral
"does not spread very well i was hoping to use this on my whole body, but it takes a pump per part of the body. tried on my hair also, but made it too oily though i have oily hair to start, so of course.-.. i will continue to use on dryer areas of my body till and my face after swimming and before dinner.",neutral
this product is not good at all. there is a very slight cooling effect for seconds and then it feels bleh on your face. way too expensive for what it does. this is not a product that you need at all for your skin. overall i would not recommend this.,negative
i have extremely sensitive skin so i was skeptical but to my surprise my skin took to the product. it does exactly what it says. i can barely see my pores and my skin has improved significantly. my advice would be start using the product every other night and then you can increase use.,positive
"loving this watermelon glow spf! it is lightweight and feels ahhh-mazing on the skin! it is formulated with not only niacinamide, but hyaluronic acid and aloe as well, which is a great combination. it blends easily and adds a nice soft glow to the skin. i also love the fact you can apply this around the eye area as it is ophthalmologist tested. i also love this for the decolletage and will be be using it in the summertime for that area! it gives such a gorgeous finish!",positive
has a nice fruity smell. the color showed up about hours later. it is a nice subtle color. within the next day or it started to fade.,positive
"i used this for months straight, morning and night. used the entire bottle. i wanted to love this so bad. i have all of the summer fridays masks and use them religiously and thought for sure this would help with my lingering acne scars. it did not make me breakout or give any irritation but it did not brighten as far as i could tell. i think i am going to buy another bottle and give it another try to see if continued use helps.",neutral
i have kind of oily skin and as much as i wanted to like this it just did not work for me it was a little too orangey and would not dry completely and kept transferring. it is really pigmented which is great and if your skin is dry i am sure it works well but for me i am going to have to give it stars,neutral
"this mask is polarizing either you love it or you hate it. it has a really strong cooling effect which i enjoy but have heard others say they do not care for it. it is also very thick to the point that it is takes some effort to wash it off. this does not bother me too much but again, i know others who have different opinions. despite the cooling and the heaviness, i would like this mask more if i felt super hydrated after the fact but i do not. it seems like the mask does something while it is on the skin but once it is washed off it is like it was never there.",neutral
not worth the hype..dried my already dry skin out more.i am going to this entire line is overrated.,negative
i felt like this cleanser did not remove my makeup that well. if your doing a double cleanse this might be nice but if your looking for a one and done this is not it. i felt like i was using a ton of product because it kept slipping out of my hands and dripping all over. the only thing i liked about it was that my skin did not feel to dry after using it.,negative
"i am on my second bottle! although this product targets for anti-ageing and i am just in my early s, i am very happy that i added the buffet into my skincare routine! my dry skin never feels softer and looks smoother! i used to have so many little pumps or under-skin pimples on my forehead, flaky skin on my nose and this product help clear and smooth them all. you can clearly see the result instantly as well after one night your skin feels a lot softer and after a week your skin appears so plump, hydrated, smoothly and youthfully. a thin layer is enough to do the magic, so ml bottle lasts a little over a month for me, and i used it twice every day. only one con is that this product does not look good under foundation or concealer, it makes your makeup base look patchy and cakey. however i do not wear foundation or concealer daily so this is not a big deal for me, i just use a normal moisturizer whenever i wear makeup. highly recommended!",positive
"was really wanting to love this product but it is very...meh. i suggest using it a couple of times a week because it is pretty strong. i love the pixi glow tonic way more, but that might just be because my skin is pretty sensitive. i might try and dilute this toner with some water and see if that helps. overall, not my favourite for my skin!",neutral
"so far i really like the retinol, i have been using it at night for a few weeks without any irritation or dryness. i am excited to see continued results over a few more weeks.",positive
wanted to try this for the winter as the cold weather retin a combo makes my skin painfully dry. this is not moisturizing at all.. sits on top of my skin and flakes up. will not purchase again,negative
gel formulas are not really for me. it feels like a serum and i would prefer a lathering cleanser. it has good ingredients but just is not my type of cleanser.,neutral
"okay, so i got this in my voxbox to try, and the first impression was that it is very thick. i actually do like the dispenser, because it is very sanitary. the product listing needs a pic to show you, because it is like a weird slide thing. the formula sat on top of my skin, when i applied it to the back of my hand, and it took some working to get it absorbed. that made me a bit worried, because i thought it might be heavy on the face. let me tell you, boy was i wrong. my face literally soaked this stuff up. i am a ponds girl, because it is always stood by me but this may be a new staple in my morningnight routine. i will definitely update if anything changes, and i will try and add a pic of the dispenser too.",positive
"this product does nothing. it has never cleared my acne or has it had my face go through the purging stage. do not use it before makeup. i made the skin lift over my acne and i have no concealer with me to cover the pimple either, so i was left with a full face of makeup and a red blown out pimple",negative
"looks beautiful and feels good, but i consistently get burnt while using this product, despite regular reapplication. after having this experience i searched for the ewgs rating of this product and saw that it is quite poor and that they predict that it does not provide as much sun protection as the spf rating would suggest. i started using this product after first aid beauty discontinued their mineral sunscreen, which i found much more effective than this one though the formula did not feel quite as nice as this one. i have now switched to peter thomas roths max mineral tinted sunscreen and find it to be an equally nice formula and much more effective sunscreen.",negative
"this product definitely came with a learning curve. once i got the hang of it, i liked it. would i buy again? no. it only works for me in the dead of winter, when my already light skin is at its lightest, and it only works when you spread it thinly on the skin and work in small sections. not really a quick, go to product, but it did do a good job of evening out my complexion and minimizing redness. very dewy finish, and will cling to dry patches or anywhere that you have over applied. also, if you apply too much and just try to massage it in, it will never adjust to your skin tone and just sits on top of it.",neutral
i wanted to like this product so much. it does not get absorbed by my skin at all. it sits on top and leaves my skin sticky and still dry somehow. i feels slimy on application. it breaks me out on my cheeks and it breaks up whatever makeup i apply over it. i have the avocado serum which is amazing. no clue why this one is such a dud for me,negative
"i felt pretty meh about this moisturizer. definitely love the idea of the brand, and their commitment to sustainability though i have some doubts about the sustainability of wild harvesting ingredients at scale.... the moisturizer itself did not do a whole lot for me, and i did not love the smell. for some reason it smelled almost plastic-y to me, though fortunately it did not linger. it did not seem to have any major effect not moisturizing enough and did not have any anti-aging effects on my skin especially at this price range, so i will be looking elsewhere.i would say this is maybe better as a primer, since it did have a mattifying effect and went on lightly.",neutral
"i am super sad but this did not work for me. after the first night i got small bumps on my temples and forehead that got slightly worse each night so i had to discontinue use. fortunately by the next day the bumps started to disappear and vanished completely after days.the pros from my limited use. the consistency was thick but spread easily so you did not need much. felt very hydrating. did not have a scent which i love in productsi think it is worth a try, as even with having a reaction, the reaction was not bad and cleared quickly.",neutral
"there are few things you need to realize about this product, this is a tinted moisturizer first, than a redness corrector and spf. if you moisturize your skin first and than apply it for all the promised benefits than it is an a product. without moisturizing it will cling to dry spots.this is not like laura mercier tinted moisturizer that works on its own for me at least i am loving the redness correcting action so far. a little goes a long way. also please warm it between your fingers before application. it is a very simple and effective product if use correctly, it is not a magic. i do not see why it will not work for anyone unless allergic to an ingredient. the spf is a bonus for me as i love to have sun protection in all of my makeup or skin care. overall i am very happy with this and will repurchase if ever runout. another tip, do not use a brush, or palms,use fingers only and work slow to allow it to set on your skin.",positive
"bought it to treat some freckles near my eye area. if it had any effect, i had not noticed it. felt just like a moisturizing serum to me.",neutral
this cleanser makes my skin smooth and clean without drying it out. i even use it around my eyes! my new go-to for end of day face washing.,positive
"i just started using this product. i have not noticed any results yet, but i can say that the formula is very smooth. there is no oilyness and makeup goes on flawless over it. the scent is nice and not overpowering. i am looking forward to chacking back in after using it for a few weeks!",positive
five stars!! love this product. was a bit disappointed by the size of the product until i started using it and realized a little goes a long way! color wise it is a touch yellow but still blendable. buildable coverage! start with a little amount!,positive
"since this was listed as a hyaluronic acid cleanser, i expected this to be a great cleanser for not drying out my skin, and was excited to use it. i used this not as my morning or night cleanser, but as my post gym cleanser since i have less time for a full skin care routine after, and usually stick with just cleanser toner moisturizer. unfortunately, this left my face feeling super, super dry, and i found myself having to apply moisturizer several times after use. that being said, i did feel like this cleaned my skin super well, and i had a noticeable decrease in maskne after a week working out with a mask on has not been kind to my skin. this would probably be an excellent cleanser if you have oily skin, or combo skin that would not be super harmed by a little bit of drying, but definitely avoid if you already have drier skin.",neutral
"it is good- it goes clear with no cast, it is not greasy, and is great alone or under makeup. it was my fave. however, the bottle is too small for the price in my opinion. unseen sunscreen supergoop performs as well but is a better value.",neutral
so. good. these are perfect for adding to your body moisturizer or buffing onto your skin after you have done your skincare routine. they really are the best i have found for providing a natural looking tan that has clean ingredients. i love to use the dark for my body and medium for my face. definitely use a mitt when applying all over or an old makeup brush to buff it onto your face andor hands. will always repurchase.,positive
"received this product for reviewing purposes from influenster it is a bit of a bummer it has not done anything to my face that i have really noticed. still on my rd week of using it, the spray is nice but with this product it may need a little longer to see some results. just fyi for me it is kind of sticky, i use it in the pm after washing my face.",neutral
"dramatically dried my skin, even though i have oily skin. and i got the value size now i have to throw it away. waste of money...",negative
"incredible, an amazing advance in skincare technology. not only is it beautifully packaged, but my skin has never reacted better to a product. my skin stays hydrated and toned all day, allowing all my other skincare products to do exactly what they need to without drying out my skin or changing the ph. i am blown away by this product and i will be purchasing it again.",positive
"i was really excited to try this product. i have acne scars and i really wanted this product to work. i did not care about the price as long as the product worked but it failed me. i got more breakouts and it did not fade my scars at all. i am very disappointed and i wish i had spent money on something else. i used the entire bottle hoping that it will work in time but nope, no change at all.",negative
"worst ever spent on a product. even with regular use, it did nothing to my dark spots- no difference at all. especially for a product to cost this much and smell so bad, it should at lease perform of what it claims to do.",negative
great for what it is- immediate hydration that does not break the bank or my skin out!,positive
"strange texture, smell is watermelon with a hint of dirt. does it is job though! i did receive this for free to try, will continue to use however would not buy personally",neutral
"liked it at first, but too thick. i started breaking out and fell out of love. it is okay. love their other products though.",neutral
love this serum! hydrating and thick without being greasy or sticky.,positive
"i love the charlotte tilbury magic cream. it is a thick consistency and it moisturizes your skin well, afterwards it left my skin glowing. i use it under makeup and it makes my base smoother and my makeup look skin like over top. i included me wearing makeup and a picture of my applying it.",positive
this definitely leaves your face red. i do not think it does much for shrinking pores or deep cleaning.,neutral
a good moisturizer for its price. i have pretty dry skin so i felt as if it was not as thick as i needed. i think this would be good for those with an oiler skin type.,positive
"i wanted to love this serum, however, i still liked it. i am an estee lauder fan, and for the price that it runs, i was expecting maybe more than i should have? this serum was nice, it had a smooth feel on the skin upon application. it did not have a strong smell, and it did not irritate my skin. there was nothing wrong with the serum, i just was not able to notice much difference with my skin in the time that i used the product. i was given a small sample, and perhaps more time and product was needed in order to notice a difference. it was okay for me. all in all an okay product.",neutral
only tried once so far but literally the next day i woke up with pimples and have been breaking out bad every since!! will try again but really wanted to love this product since so many people have been raving about it.,negative
"it is ok. it stings the face after applying but goes away after a while. sticky when touching face right after applying, but it goes away after a few minutes. someone commented that it can be used as deodorant, so i tried it. i tried this product for about two weeks applied every other day, but i do not notice any difference beside my skin feeling a little softer.",neutral
"i love the product, but it is too tinted for my very fair skin that will not even tan. would be great for light to medium skin tones though who like the dewy glow.",neutral
"i was looking for an eye cream to help with my really dry under eyes. just for reference i have combination skin, oily t-zone dry to normal on cheeks and around the mouth. tried this cream after a sales associate highly recommended it. i used it once, and never again. my eyes tingled and itched, i used this overnight. i also do not have sensitive skin usually. plus i have been trying to avoid parabens and sulfates, this has a ton of them, no thank you.",negative
"this is a nice moisturizer but not moisturizing enough for me. i have combo skin, which gets very very dry in the winter. i found this to be no better than the cerave moisturizing cream not lotion!, which is even more affordable, so i am sticking with that. the pump was sort of cool, but sometimes it would not work right away, and that was frustrating. i like how inkey products list what step of the care routine they corresponded to-- wish all products did that-- but ultimately that was not enough to keep it. i am sure this works fine for people with less dry skin.",neutral
"not only does this product feel gritty on my skin, it makes my face and hands smell horrendous, no matter how much i wash. it is easy for the smell to get into your hair too. not happy with it",negative
i genuinely loved this product. i use it at night as part of my skincare routine. it is not as sticky as some ha serums and is hydrating. my skin totally soaks it up. i have seen improvements in my skins ability to hold moisture since i have incorporated this product into my routine. as well as a smoother texture over time.,positive
this product is ok but it is not very moisturizing and it is kind of sticky,negative
"this stuff is magic!! i have been using it a little over one week, along with some other products from the ordinary, and my skin has instantly cleared up and feels so much better my acne, which is cystic and painful and inflamed, shrunk and felt less painful instantly. i cannot recommend this enough",positive
"i messed up my skin barrier and have been looking for products that help restore it. this oil is lightweight, absorbs fast and feels dry quickly on the skin. my skin feels and looks great with just a couple days of using it.",positive
"ok, so this product is not foam like i thought from the description. i do think my face feels clean and i love that smell but like the description says it foams and i did not see much of a foam",negative
love the idea of the product but is too strong for my skin. i suffer with folliculitis and unfortunately this triggered folliculitis in my beard. very good and efficacious product but for sensitive slime i would definitely recommend a lower dose of vitamin c. i was given this product in exchange for my honest review. love drunk elephant still! just cannot use this specific product.,neutral
"it stings, but bearable. i only use every friday and i do not see any noticeable overnight smoothness result. for the price, i think it should deliver.",neutral
it leaves a terrible white cast. the bottle was barely full. i am going back to paulas choice booster.,negative
"i was very excited to receive this product for review purposes, all opinions are my own however it did nothing for my skin. i used it for about three weeks and saw no noticeable difference in my skin. it did not look for feel different. so unfortunate",negative
the squalane vitamin c rose oil is phenomenal. i leaves my skin dewy and hydrated. i would totally recommend it. i first started using it when i got it as a sample and ended up getting it in the full size. it has a strong rose scent to it so if you do not like that i would not get it.,positive
"i have been using this every day for a few months now and i feel like this product is just not strong enough for me to see results. i think it is a nice product to start off with if you are new to chemical exfoliant but it is not really doing it for my skin. it might also be better for people with sensitive skin. i was using glossiers exfoliating skin perfector before and was seeing great results with smaller pores, more glowing skin, and reduced oil. i will definitely be switching back after i use up all of this product.",neutral
i have just reached my late twenties and have recently been struggling with under eye bags and eye puffiness. i have tried everything from cheap amazon eye masks to tea bags,positive
"meh. nothing great. it was not moisturizing at all, very thin. i did not hate it, did not love it. will not be repurchasing.",neutral
"first to start with the smell-i am not a fan of it.however even though its tacky,i like the serum.using it for over a week now i can say that my skin likes it.i will see in few weeks if there are any more results.i i can say that i have used other de products and this one did not have that wow effect on me as the other products did.",positive
"i had high expectations and skinfix exfoliating pads did not meet it all for me. if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you. but i adore the fact that the packaging is environmentally friendly and the product is cruelty-free.",negative
"does not work, so mad i waisted my money i would give stars if possible",negative
"i am loving this hydrating serum! i think will replace using hylaronic acid in my routine, as that usually pills and this does not at all. this is like a gel serum that makes my skin so smooth and moisturizer goes nicely on top. gifted by sunday riley",positive
i love these pads! so easy to use no need to rinse after my skin looks much brighter only after days and they are pads so is very convenient! good for breakouts too! highly recommended!!!!,positive
i have heard such great things about this moisturizer so when it was a point perk i had to grab it. if was just okay though. it was a much thinner and lighter moisturizer than i was expecting and did nothing for my drier skin. i think i would have really liked this when my skin was oily pre use of retinol but after every use i would wake up with dry patches.,neutral
"my first eye cream, so really do not have anything to compare it to lol.. the skin around my eyes has stopped feeling dry after using this product for about a week, and my dark circles have both gotten smaller and lighter!! will definitely repurchase",positive
"i have eczema prone skin and i am allergic to many moisturizers. i have used this cream for a month and my skin no longer feels tight or has any dry patches. this cream is a godsend and it works wonders! after i wash my face, i apply two pumps on my face and neck twice a day. the pump design is very unique and easy to use. this product was a complimentary product from skinfix for testing and review.",positive
"this is the only product i have gotten from the ordinary that have not loved. i am iffy on the texture, and i do not find it hydrating enough.",neutral
"not going to lie, i was super excited to try this when i received this to try. i followed the instructions and applied after cleansing my face and did not notice anything. i have had cheaper products do more than what this did. which disappoints me because i really wanted this to work based on the name and what is in it. it felt like water going on and did not feel anything special or extra moisturizing. i gave three stars because i think maybe over time it will help? but it seems overpriced.",neutral
"so, in general these days i stick to mineral sunscreens and love ones that are super moisturizing and work well under makeup.now, when i use it by itself it works fine! it is a little greasy at the start and then when it sink in it is not as greasy.i had been testing this out in the winter when it is cold out, so i cannot really judge how it does in the humid hot heat.i usually use light foundations or tinted moisturizers, and i did not feel my makeup sat well on top of it.but, i do like this if i am running out for a quick errand to put on my face and neck and arms. is it my all time fav? no.",neutral
"these are average and that is being generous i am going to. they do feel cooling on the skin... not much liquid on them surprisingly and unfortunately my under eye area feels a bit tacky once i remove pat around the orbital bone. will not return and will use these up, but cannot recommend and will not be repurchasing!",neutral
i hate this.. i have very oil skin and hair and if anything i felt more oily when i put this on. it felt very heavy on my skin and i just really did not like it. i hope that i can still return it.,negative
"this eye cream leaves your under eye feeling smooth. does not have a strong scent, almost non existent and it is thicker than gel based products but thinner than cream. love it!",positive
"love!! i have only been using this product for about weeks at night, but i love it!! if lather is important to you in a face wash, this will not be the product for you. you just gently massage this wash on your face, but once you rinse- your skin feels clean, soothed, and not stripped! i have oilyacne prone skin and have it under decent control, but after stressful life events, i was breaking out! this wash really calmed my skin and got me back on track! definitely recommend and i will definitely buy this again!!",positive
"i honestly have a combination type skin. my goals is to always be able to hydrate my skin. with this mask, when i used it, created rashes and acne to sprout up, making my skin itchy. but i noticed that maybe i do not know how to wear the mask the right way. i was not sure if i needed to moisturize first, or cleanse the skin and then put it on, i do not know, maybe that is why my skin reacted in a bad way.",neutral
"this is by far the worst sunscreen i have ever used. i have fairly dry skin, despite this it made me look extremely oily, on top of this, i have never had issue with acne i know, sue me and now i have ever since using it.",negative
this does not do much to provide a moisture boost for my dry skin. it also smells like classic pledge dusting spray our grandmas all used. it is gross.,negative
"super thick, i use this in my legs and elbows only as it can cause breakouts on arms and back",negative
"i wanted to love this but it does not work well with my skin type. it is extremely difficult for me to find a lightweight, oil-free, moisturizing that sits well under makeup and while this product does sit well under makeup, i found myself blotting my face more throughout the day since i started using this. sadly, this is not the product for me.",neutral
smells like proactive moisturizer and did not do anything really. so glad i got a sample instead of actually purchasing this. it just sat on my skin and made me feel like a greast mess.,negative
"so i tried this product for the first time and honestly it was not bad the only complaints i have is that if you have like oily skin it would not be good because it is an oil based product and it does stay kind of oily and also if you are like me and hate the feeling of greasiness on your face this is not it either. i have combination skin where i am only oily in my t-zone but it still felt like i had a ton of grease on my face in that area. so to fix the greasiness i felt in that area i used my super goop resetting powder on top of it, but i do not think you should have to buy a whole separate product to enjoy this one.on the parts of my face that were not as oily it worked well like my cheeks, but on my nose and forehead i did not like how this product felt. it is more oily when you first apply and then the oiliness kind of goes away but not fully. i ended up washing it off after having it on for a few minutes, it is an ok product so i will not return it instead i will just use it on my hands, neck and chest. but i would not really recommend it to anybody because there are way better sunscreen sticks out there.",neutral
received as a sample and it looked nice and dewy although not moisturizing at all. i ended up with a horrible breakout.,negative
i seldom write reviews but i am so so impressed... i have oily skin with large pores and i typically get a lot of blackheads on my nose. i noticed a drastic difference after one use. most of my blackheads were gone! i cannot wait to see the results after more uses.,positive
"i really wish this product worked better. it did lessen my acne, but i still aways have clusters of zits all over. the most noticeable thing that was not exactly desirable is that it made my zits more compact for a lack of a better term, and therefore more painful",neutral
"when i first opened the package i was surprised by how luxe the container is. plus you can purchase refillable pods for a small discount so there is an attempt to be eco-friendly. for the actual product, it felt nice on the skin but took a very very long time to absorb into the skin. it did not layer either really nicely with my skin care products so it would pill. overall not impressed and i do not want to have to change my whole skincare routine to make the moisturizer work.",negative
this product stung and irritated my skin. it also had a strong chemical smell. i have other all-natural options that i will return to using instead.,negative
"after just two weeks of using this cream, the texture of my skin has completely changed. my skin is smooth, soft, fine lines are no longer visible and little imperfections are gone! my skin looks the best it has looked in such a long time. i have minimal rosacea that has completely disappeared since using this cream. i could not be happier!",positive
"i followed the instructions for a fine line on my forehead. although after the first box, it does appear less prominent in the morning that fades away by the afternoon. did not work for me",neutral
"it is definitely a pure silicone product. smooths out well but if you rub it in too much, it pills. it also pills under sunscreen. has a scent like crushed vitamin capsules but i do not notice it after a while. i have no idea if it does the job or not, have not really noticed a difference in dark spots. but at least the vitamin c is stable in this waterless formulation.",neutral
love love love this product. repurchased it many many many times and will continue to do so.,positive
"i live in a humid environment and this did not moisturize my skin at all. it just felt sticky, and could be peeled off once it dried.",negative
"i do not use collagen and again i do not do floral scents, especially very strong ones.",negative
i wanted to like this so bad because i read such good things about it but it just did not work for me. it was not moisturizing enough and it broke me out quite a bit. it did feel like it soothed my skin though which was nice since my skin was feeling raw after using tretinoin for my acne.,neutral
"this is one of my staples from the ordinary! i am in my twenties and have not noticed fine lines yet. but i have been reading about peptides as an effective anti-aging measure, and was excited to find matrixyl available at such an affordable price. i do not have enough signs of aging to see visible results. but i do really like how this serum feels when applied. it is easy to layer with other products, and i do not think that it is ever caused irritation for me even though i have eczema with flares that come and go, and have been using this product for months.",positive
"this was recommended by a friend that is a skin care junkie and has tried everything! i, on the other hand, am not a skin care junkie so for me this was a big purchase. i am, with pale freckled combination skin. i have age spots and uneven skin tone. i have always been prone to breakouts, especially around my period. the older i get the less i like wearing a lot of makeup because it only looks fresh for a couple hours and then it starts caking in the creases and my skin feels greasy and itchy. plus it contributes to breakouts. that said i have really been loving this cicapair treatment for the past month since i started using it! like others have said, it is not super moisturizing so i do put on a simple oil-free facial moisturizer and eye cream before i apply this treatment. also, i apply this sparingly and use just enough to put a thin layer over my entire face except the eyes. i noticed the st time that i used it my skin instantly looked more even-toned and brighter, it was exciting to see these instant results! it does not cover up my frecklesage spots but it does help to dull them a little. it absorbs into the skin quickly with no residue or buildup again, i use it sparingly. i still notice a difference at the end of the evening when i am brushing my teeth, my skin just looks betterbrighterevenhealthier! i also have not had any increase in breakouts since i started using this, if anything my skin is breaking out less. this stuff does not take the place of foundation in terms of total coverage, but i feel confident now just wearing this with a little concealer and light dusting of powder and doing my eye makeuplipstick. i love that over time it will only help my skin instead of the opposite effect that makeup has. it is pricey for my budget, but i estimate that jar will last me at least months of almost daily use and maybe longer. i will definitely keep using this for as long as they make it!",positive
"i thought i would try this because it is so affordable. the product i received feels separated. part of it goes on thick like vaseline, and then while i am squeezing the thick part out, a thin drizzle of oil leaks everywhere. it does not melt and spread easily so i feel like i am pulling at my skin unnecessarily when i cleanse with this. somehow, i still always have raccoon eyes afterward and have to go in with another makeup removed. as others have mentioned, this leaves a very oily residue that is hard to wash off after. there are way better cleansing balms out there.",negative
"smells amazing and gives great color good, i highly recommended you cannot go wrong with this stuff. it goes on smoothly, does not streak got me super glowing. i get compliments all of the time.",positive
"i try to give lotions and serums a fair shake and use them for about a month or more before making a decision. the funny thing about this product is that after about a month of using it i found that my undereyes were actually quite swollen and irritated. i was super weirded out, but then i read that this is happening to other people as well.",negative
"this product is a desaster on my skin. even if i use a single pump for my entire face, it does not absorb at all and stays on like a shiny foil all day long. it is not just glowy which i guess i could reposition as dewy, but also sticky! when i add moisturiser on top it all becomes a dough on my face. luckily i work from home... the only reason for the second star is that the bottle is fun. however, that is an expensive plastic bottle if you do not like the contents... will definitely not buy again.",negative
really wanted to love this cleanser but started to get huge breakouts after using it and i have combination skin. not made for my skin!,negative
"it does not make me look cake-y but i do not know how effective this is as a sunscreen. there is also a packaging issue where it would sometimes leak from the bottom or when i do not know if it is open and when i tap onto my hand, there is a cloud of powder. oof",neutral
did not like this product. it pilled with or without makeup on top. felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and it felt waxy. ended up throwing it away.,negative
"i got the mini version of this product in a gift set and would not have expected this product to do more than all of my moisturizers can do, combined. this is literally the only product that actually gets rid of my dried upflakey skin around my nose, which is something i was not expecting from this kind of product.",positive
"i so wanted to love this serum with all of the boosting of the probiotics and superfoods, but unfortunately it left my face after a fews hours very oily and sticky. for the price i would look for something that would make my face feel less oily and lightweight. after a week of using the serum ampm my face broke out a bit.",neutral
"i really had high hopes for this eye cream but unfortunately did not notice a difference. i am with under eye wrinkles and used this in the am and at bedtime. the consistency is light, goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly but seemed to be a bit dry when i woke up in the morning more so than before using this product. i would not repurchase.",neutral
"i really wanted to love this product. it does lather nice, is gentle and made my skin feel clean but i just could not do the smell. it reminds me of pine sol other than that it is nice!",neutral
"cannot understand how this product earned almost stars, it does absolutely nothing to mattify the skin and reduce pores. my face gets shiny in an hour after i put my makeup on, do not see any pores improvement whatsoever.",negative
"love how squeeky clean my skin feels, the fact that it is cruelty free and how it uses less toxic ingredients. however for my skin, this was very drying and caused my skin to flake and peel. i now use it once in awhile when my skin is excessively oily, but i am cautious to using this regularly. my skin tends to be oily in the springsummer and dryer autumnwinter.",neutral
"i received this product complimentary through influenster. the bottle and display if beautiful. and it smells amazing out of the bottle but when i used it for the first time, about a minute later it made my skin smell like a maple bar doughnut. i did not think anything of it until i layed down and my spouse asked what smelt like doughnuts. i was so sad when the odor changed. but in the bottle it smelt amazing.. i have been trying to push through the smell every night after a week and a half and i cannot do it anymore. i honestly do not see a difference at all in my skin.. maybe i need to use it longer, but the smell is overpowering my will to keep going. i highly recommend testing the scent on different skin types. i feel like this product is like perfume. it does not smell the same on everyone.",negative
"i received this product free from influenster and guerlain in exchange for my honest review. i have been using this product for days i have incorporated this serum in my morning and night routine. i truly believe i need more time to give an in depth review. i can say that the packaging is beautiful. a small amount goes a long way and it is super easy to put on. i love how the serum feels on my skin and how it makes my skin look as it feels quite moisturizing my skin looks dewy and i have no dry patches at all. i am really loving the radiant look it give me. i can say um starting to see a difference on how my pores look, they are looking better. i need more time to see how much more can i see happening. i do know that this serum makes my skin feel better than what i was previously using. the down side to this serum is pricing. it is a luxury item and its for this particular serum. i am loving using this serum and so far i can say i will repurchase.",positive
"i love this sunscreen! it comes out looking beige and watery, which scared me up first. however when i put it on my face it only took about five drops for my face and neck and it went on completely clear with no white cast. i really wanted to test out its primer capabilities so i put it underneath the morphe skin tint and concealer and it looked perfect. the sunscreen primer really made my skin look dewy.",positive
"i always receive samples or i go to sephora and ask for samples, because this cream is a little expensive. but now for the sale finally i bought, i have oily combination skin with dry patches around my mouth and chin. this cream is a miracle for me, i do not mind have oils in my skin, but i always look for the most hydrated moisturizer. i do love this product is so good with my skin gently and smooth out my skin. also i was using samples for different brands they i have and my skin was breaking out so bad i was having a huge pimples on my neck to and using a lot of product to remove it and nothing helps, and finally i can use all the full sizes now, i do not have more samples or minis yay y just put some of this cream in my face and felt as sleep, next morning my face was looking radiant and the pimples faded, still there but not as gross and big like before, more days and i can see the real result, in love with tacha. expensive brand but worth it.",positive
i love everything about this eye product. i accidentally did wiping motions the first time which is a no-no. i use this at least once a day and have noticed a difference in my under eye.,positive
was this formula changed? i started a new bottle and my face is breaking out!!!,negative
"i really wanted to like this cleanser, as soon as it came out. the pull and draw was all the nutrients this cleanser was packed with. the packaging is beautiful and there is a light scent that is not offensive to anyone. at first, i believed my skin to be purging when i started to use this cleaner, but now i realize these are full blown breakouts. i am sad because my skin was clear before this. returned.",negative
"this product really impressed me, it is inexpensive but great quality! it is formula is also vegan and clean which is perfect for my sensitive skin. i have added this to my everyday makeup routine! i love it!",positive
yes this pulls your skin taught. it dries to a constant itch. and it has a shiny sheen to it. you cannot put any kind of concealer product on underneath it. and anything you put on top looks splotchy and horrible. so there are no net benefits unfortunately. returned as fast as i could.,negative
i have really oily skin and always have and this definitely helps it. it makes my skin nice and soft. would definitely recommend it,positive
i returned it. it looked very pale and cakey. i wanted to love it but it did not work for me.,negative
"i like this cleanser. it has a very light scent to it. my skin felt so much smoother after using it. it also felt very clean. it did not foam up as my other cleansers. it felt more like an exfoliating cleanser.my face did not feel stripped of moisture after using this. after using this in combination with the cleansing oil, my eyes stung a bit. i am not sure which of the products caused this reaction exactly.",positive
"unfortunately, i suffer from rosacea and this cream made me break out terribly.",negative
". stars. i am just not sure about this, even though i really wanted to love it. it just did not seem to do much for me. the smell is lovely and subtle, really natural and green scent, packaging is lovely as well, like all tata harper products. i just did not see actual results so it was a bit disappointing.",neutral
dried out my skin after one application. it gave me a feeling of tightness.,negative
"it does the job and removes my makeup well. but i always have blurry vision, like a film over my eyes after i wash it off i also use foam cleanser. did not have this problem with my previous oil cleanser. will not repurchase",neutral
so far it is nice-lightweight and does a decent job of hydration but boy does it pill. i absolutely can not wear during the day under makeup. it is a lot of for a so-so moisturizer i can only use at night,neutral
obsessed! i love how lightweight this eye cream is-gives my under eyes an instant refresh. i have dry and sensitive skin and the hydration was unbelievable.,positive
"incredible spot treatment! i have pretty dry skin, so it is hard to find a spot treatment that is not going to further dry out and irritate my skin but still be effective. this is the perfect balance. my worst spots disappeared practically overnight, and this is light enough for me to keep wearing every night to reduce my other blemishes. i cannot recommend this enough",positive
"color c smell b i did not think it was as bad as some of the reviews say, smells like a normal self tannertransfer to clothes a i did not notice any transfer at all and i wore a white shirt day of streak free ci expected to be able to use this as a gradual tanning lotion like every other day, but no, no, no. my color after the first hours was perfect, streak free. when i woke up in the morning it had developed even more and became very orangey on me i am pretty pale and i had tons of streaks. i thought i had applied it pretty carefully. i did not put it on my face but i would have definitely needed to buy one of their face products because of the difference in tone. i am not a huge tanning lotion person so i am not sure how it compares to others, but this was definitely not a natural look on me.",neutral
it pills. the glow is amazing if you are not wearing anything else but most of the other products i use will make this sunscreen pill.,neutral
"i think this is really blah face cream. i have been using it for months and i do not see any changes, and in fact, i normally see my face go red when i apply it. i do not care for the serum, either.",negative
"this cleansing balm is a great price point and feels very gentle, but does not work well on waterproof makeup. it would probably be fine for anyone who wears minimal makeup or just sunscreen. it is a bit difficult to get out of the tube as well. i am not sure if i will purchase again- i would need to supplement with a waterproof eye makeup remover, so probably will not as i would prefer one product for both jobs.",neutral
i love this product. my skin looks great after wearing it all night. my only reason for giving it starts instead of is that i have a hard time sleeping with it on and find myself waking up a lot when i have it on. the results are fantastic! would recommend this product.,positive
this product was gifted by summer fridays. i have normal to dry skin and feel as though this moisturizer was hydrating but not overly done. it absorbs into the skin quickly with leaving it with a nice dewy appearance.,neutral
"just opened up my sephora package and mine also had that weird white stuff all in it, still in the plastic wrap and all. def will be returning, disappointed",negative
"i agree with the other reviewers this is way too tacky. i can feel that i have a film sitting on top of my skin. i always wait for it to dry, but it never actually does. i do not think i will buy it again. i have been using niacinamide from the ordinary instead, so i do not really need this product.",neutral
"moisturizing but makes my skin feel oily if i do not put on powder over it. and even with powder, i felt like my forehead got greasier than normal after a few hours. will use it up as a night cream, but will not repurchase.",neutral
i am yo. i have oily skin. i like this pink tint but it is slightly oily for my skin. i did try this during the summer time. i still kept this because i do want to try during the winter time. i like the unscented supergoop spf better. the price is not attractive but the expiration date is. years away so i decided to keep this one. not recommended for summer season and oily skin. otherwise i can see how it can be good for women with dry skin.,positive
"felt moisturizing and easy to apply, a small amount was able to cover my entire face. i was not a fan of the dewy look. it was too shiny and shimmery for me. made my forehead look oily and it looked like i had covered my face in highlight powder. i was hoping to be able to wear on its own for those quick get ready days, but i will be returning this product for something else.",negative
"supergoops old cc cream was magic... it felt light like i was not wearing anything, blended into my skin, and perfected my skin... evened it out, hid my tired mom eyes, perfect amount of coverage, and the right color even though the shades were not so specific like this new formula. even though it felt light, the coverage was actually really good. but supergoop decided to get rid of this perfect magic cc cream and replaced it with this new formula that has even cleaner ingredients and higher spf. sounds great, but results are terrible. it did not provide anywhere close to the same magic coverage, but feels like i am wearing makeup. and then i actually had to put on more makeup to get the coverage and color i needed. i never felt i needed to wear bronzer or blush with the old formula blush andor bronzer enhanced my look but without blushbronzer i still looked like a normal person with great natural looking skin. this new formula is more like actual foundation where it makes my face look flat and i have to add back color through bronzer and blush. you would think this would at least mean better coverage, but nope... my under eyes looked just as tired as before applying, where the old formula magically would fix my tired under eyes to the point where i really did not need concealer. if anyone finds an alternative product that works like the old cc cream, pleasssse let me know!! i think if you click my user name you can send me a message??and for reference, i did not have a lot of hope for this product based on the other reviews but i was hoping that maybe the cream i use on my face before applying this was part of the secret magic and i would still experience this secret magic with the new formula... obviously not the case.",negative
"the dr. zenovia skincare glycolic acne control peel pads do work. since i am not used to acids, my skin did get worse before it got slightly better. there is a slight tingling sensation and does not leave the skin feeling tight or dry. i believe that if i continue to use it, it will make my acne scaring better. the price for the amount of product is worth it.",positive
made me breakout. skin was blotchy in the morning when usually it looked it is beat. also did not notice any improvement with hydration.,negative
"i am very disappointed in this product. i absolutely loved the old gel cream, it was a great normal-combination skin moisturizer and it smelled amazing!! this product is such a downgrade in every aspect, i am upset about it... i really hope laneige brings back the gel cream they discontinued because this new one is not it!!",negative
"i have been using this product for one month and i am of the way through my bottle. this product has been life changing for my skin. it has gotten rid of all my acne and small bumps and has almost gotten rid of all the redness on my cheeks. i also use the essence after, but i had started the essence about. months earlier. it was not until i added this to my routine when i noticed a huge difference. i love skin care and have tried most high end brands, although i never routinely included a toner and this routine has been life changing. i will never not be able to use this toner. my skin is clearer, brighter, evenly balanced and glowy er. if you are on the fence about trying this toner- buy it during a sale and use it for a month. so worth it!!",positive
"at first i had great expectations for this product. reviews are good and the ingredients seem to work. but the first day i used it my face turned red and had a burning feeling. later on i tried to use it with a less amount on damp face, no redness anymore but still cannot adsorb easily and no other beauty effects. would not recommend it and really should have bought another product that is big brand",negative
"i could use this nightly. i am loving how well it works with all my different regimens with no bad reaction. instead of mixing it into my moisturizer, i apply an even layer immediately on top before my moisturizer has a chance to absorb. i do not deal with pilling or any greasy feeling afterwards. dark spots lighten faster than on their own. i do still need to test it with my retinoids, but i recommend this mask.",positive
"i was super excited to try this sunscreen especially because it is reef safe! however, it was too thick and tacky for my taste. it felt really heavy on my face, and the smell bothered me especially when wearing my mask. i do feel like it protected me, however, so i am disappointed to see it go.",neutral
"this wash was great as far as texture and leaving my face feeling clean, but the smell was not my fav. i powered through it because of the other things!",neutral
"the product is too thick for tube packaging. on my second use, the top of the tube actually burst from the pressure to squeeze out the balm. i had to decant the remnants in to an old moisturizer tub to continue using. packaging aside, the product works as advertised, it removes almost all make-up dark, long-wear eye make-up may require separate make-up remover and otherwise serves as a great first cleanser. for the price, it is decent value if you can overlook the poor packaging.",neutral
"i received this complimentary from biossance. absolutely love this wash, it removed all my makeup and left my face feeling so good. it does not smell bad but not the greatest and it is purple i used the smallest amount and with a little water it foamed up and increased. i was gifted by biossance and i am glad i was.",positive
"not my favorite setting spray although it smells amazing. i would say it is more of a hydrating mist to use throughout the day but urban decays all nighter is much better at setting. if you already have a good skin care routine, this will make you look shiny. i now mix two pumps with my armani skin foundation and then set with urban decay for an all-day, dewy glow",neutral
"this product is given to me for free by damdam. it is an okay moisturizer, no smell at all. i have a combination skin and i kind of like it. however i think it is overpriced and there is better options out there.",positive
"i love yttp products, but been using this for a while, and either than hydrating, i have not noticed a reduction in puffiness or firmness around the eyes, so therefore i do not think this is worth the for it. i found it to cause puffiness when i wake up in the morning after applying this at night. not a winner, but other yttp products are amazing!",neutral
so far so good! this cleanser provides a great lather so you only need a dime sized amount. after using the cleanser my face felt refreshed and took off any excess makeup.,neutral
i brought this for my few dark spots when you put it on it feels sticky the product not lying like i would wash my hands to much work but it helped me with my uneven texture. still using it because its wasting if i do not use it lol still though but i would not repurchase.,neutral
i had high hopes for this product but i was left kind of disappointed. i have used this product until there was nothing left. this product did not do anything for my dark spots and did not brighten my face. however it did feel a bit moisturizing and have a faint nice smell. compared to a lot of other products it is on the cheaper side but i feel like you can find better products for around the same price.,neutral
"i really wanted to love this product after reading such rave reviews, but after trying it only two times, my skin was not happy. it made my face burn within only a short period of being in the sun, and i usually never burn at all. the burning feeling lasted all day until i realized this was not working for me, and washed it all off. i also broke out in tiny little whiteheads all over my face, especially on my forehead, which i read in reviews has happened to others as well. my face hurt so bad and looked so irritated for weeks. this has to go back, and if you have sensitive skin, i would be careful. my skin is pretty normal and i have never had a problem with a sunscreen before, but it did not like this product at all.",negative
"not great for removing makeup. when comparing to the ordinary cleansing balm it falls very flat. slightly grainy, and irritating to the skin. leaves makeup behind.",negative
i really wanted to love this because i am not a fully foundation make-up look girly but this irritates close to eyes and wipes off so easy- it does not melt absorb in you can wipe it off with a finger,neutral
"i have combination skin that oils up a bit throughout the day, so i figured this would be a perfect moisturizer for me. sadly this stuff disappears on my skin almost immediately, making me feel dried out and tight. i tried using a lot more product and it helped a little, but by the end of one week it seemed like i had already used a large portion of the jar. you should not have to use that much to feel moisturized, especially at this price point.",negative
i generally love the inkey list but this just did not do anything for me. i used as instructed with no diminish to my pimples. i would prefer a patch like zitsticka if i recall the name correctly.,neutral
so i know this is mainly for combination or normal skin. i have the driest skin in the world. i am drier than the sahara desert. this is the best cleanser ever in my opinion for dry skin with pores! i have never found such an amazing deep cleanser and it does not damage my skin at all. i was breaking out from the fenty beauty foundation and when i tried this cleanser out.. my skin cleared up withing two days! it felt relieved! i was so happy! it gently cleanses my pores as well and does not feel like my skin is ripping apart! i love this so so much! i am definitely going to try more tatcha products.,positive
"i have eczema and often have peeling or red skin around my mouth or forehead-- after using this consistently for about a week after washing my face and under my serum moisturizer i have noticed a huge difference. no peeling or excessive redness. will definitely purchase again, and likely the larger size once i am not traveling as frequently!",positive
"over all good product. there is a noticeable difference. it is not a miracle worker but i like it. i probably will not buy it again, there are better serums out there, but it is good for the price.",positive
"should not be marketed as a sunscreen, instead as a primer. i am not a fan of the consistency and every time i put it on it just feels like it is clogging my pores. it has a velvety consistency and it just feels as if it immediately sinks into my skin which makes it impossible to distribute it evenly. i wanted to like this but some products are not for everyone",negative
really nice texture and very smooth however i have been using it for a while and if you are not used to retinols it definitely can dry out your skin i had to stop using it. it is also best to be another sunscreen over the top which defeats the purpose,neutral
"my skin had become both sensitive and dry lately, and i would heard good things about this cream. after trying it for a week, it really improved my skin. i prefer to use it at night, as it is a bit rich for daytime, but i would definitely recommend this product.",positive
i was hoping this could replace my tatcha night cream since the price point was a little better but after only a few uses my skin started breaking out like crazy. it really clogged my pores.,negative
"i am in my s and have had very mild acne on my forehead for years and nothing i have ever tried has gotten rid of it. i have tried everything, acne products were too drying and made me breakout more so i have just been stuck. i have been using this product for a week now and wow it is definitely brightening and it is visibly reduced the amount of bumps on my forehead. if you have mild acne andor sensitive skin this is an amazing product!",positive
omg!! i just got this product in the mail and i am obsessed! i live in a very dry place and winter is always so harsh on my skin. it is been so hard trying to find a good hydrating mask that does not make me feel oily. i put this on and it feels so refreshing. when i woke up my skin was not only hydrated but glowing!!!,positive
"product is decent, not something amazing. the packaging is bad because the paste will dry at the opening of the tube and then you cannot get any product out. this is too pricey for the packaging issues and mediocrity of the product itself.",negative
i loved the consistency and definitely hydrated my skin but i was done with it within weeks. like it only lasted a month. for the price i was expecting a little bit longer lasting power.,positive
"i purchased this because i want a moisturizer that does not clog my pores but hydrates my skin during the winter. this is definitely light and absorbs very very quickly, but it does not really moisturize my skin well. it does not break me out, but i cannot help but feel that this do s not really do the job of hydrating my skin.",neutral
"did not break me out. hydrated but does not make you oily. has a nice, calming smell without being obnoxious i am looking at you huda beauty foundation",positive
"it is a bit pricey but i have very fair irish skin and sunscreen needs to be reapplied during the day and i have not found anything better. i am so powders are not my friend, they just start to settle into fine lines i did not even know i had. i wish the spf was higher. this does not make my skin breakout at all.",positive
"i hate to give it stars but i guess this moisturizer is not for me. it made me break out and it was not moisturizing at all, it just sits on top of my skin making it sticky and oily. i used a year ago then i broke out really bad but i did not think it was it. so i stoped using it and it took me months to get rid of my acne. out of my ignorance i bought it again to give it another try, along with oil balancing cleanser from olehenriksen. i broke out again. after i stopped both of them my face calmed down. i guess ole products are not for me.",negative
"this sunscreen was pretty decent! i have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin and was worried this would make me break out. luckily it did not. while it does absorb well into the skin, it is still a bit heavy for my oily skin. the oil-free version was much more lightweight although that one broke me out. i love that this does not smell or feel like normal sunscreen. there is a small fragrance, but it is not pungent. it layered well under makeup too, but i found that i had to powder a bit more because of my oily skin. overall, it is a decent sunscreen. i wish it was larger for the price point though",positive
"this product only gives superficial moisturization like the website claims, nothing deep or penetrating. skin is left dried after cleansing the face.",neutral
"i could only leave this mask on for minutes as the tingle was more like stinging on my face. luckily my skin was not red after washing it off, and it seemed to refine my pores a bit, but i will have to go gently with this one. i also layered on soothing and hydrating serums, a rich night cream, and some oil afterwards because my skin is dry and also to stave off any drying from the mask. maybe my skin is more sensitive than i realized. i have used other masks with acids and have not found them as stinging as this one.",neutral
this was received complimentary from dermalogica. this is another hit from dermalogica! i have combo skin and this keeps my oily section under control while my dryer spots stay hydrated and moisturized. my skin feels plump and looks juicy! recommend!,positive
did not agree with my skin. the only thing i could use it for was my hair and it is not very moisturizing. i would skip this one all together,negative
it does give you colour after the first time but i am still wondering when it will disappear. i have used lots of cleansers for last days and i still see the brown colour after wiping.,neutral
this is my favorite face wash of all times. i have products from tatcha and using them together have changed my face. absolutely worth the cost.,positive
"this smells like algae or fish but i do not think it is too overwhelming. i have extremely dry skin and found it to not help with that issue. i have been using it for a couple months on and off and have noticed it has some noticeable effect on fine lines. after application there seems to be a slight soapy after scent. within minutes my skin is still extremely dry.it has an interesting effect on the skin making it a bit glistening and does sink in very well.i like origins white tea skin barrier serum much better, but if you have normal skin this might be a favorite.",neutral
"i do not get the popularity here. i have used it a few times and saw no difference. also, the nd or rd time i was using it, an air bubble popped in the jar and i noticed a huge empty space, like a cave in. feels like i paid for a meh product that is not even completely there.",neutral
"this product feels synthetic and poor quality. the pearly hue does not compliment a natural or minimalist look if that is what you are going for. additionally, the jelly texture was not pleasing for me. i am trying to wrap my head around the marketing as well- honey balm, moisturizer, jelly,... please pick one! the only thing i am wishful for is my money back after purchasing this.",negative
"the price is awesome and i have seen a difference in my sebum production and helped reduce the size of any pimples i have, however i seem to breakout whenever i miss a night without using this serum",neutral
"i bought the set of three balm cleaners which included lemon, peach, and strawberry. the cleansers smelled really good but was really a pain to take off. i will be sticking to my origins oil cleanser for now.",neutral
"i love tower so i really wanted to love this product but this just did not work for my skin. i have extremely sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. when i first applied the product, i was surprised that it was so watery. it felt nice on my skin but as i used it throughout the days, i found that each day, it made skin more and more irritated. my skin felt tight and very itchy. the chlorine smell was also off putting, but i appreciate that this product did not contain strong added scents to it. i continued to use the product despite the irritation but found no major improvement in my skin after the days. once i stopped using this product, the irritation stopped so i am assuming an ingredient in this product just did not sit right with my skin. this was gifted by tower beauty.",negative
"absolutely a no no for me. first, it irritates my eyes so baaaad! and that is the first reason i used balm cleansers, because i used makeup everyday and my eyes are always my focus point. even for a no makeup type of day, mascara and something in my lids are my go to. back to this product, do not eliminate all my mascara and i do not used water proof, always live my eyes red and i have to go back with several layers to removed all my makeup and i do not wear a ton. in the rest of my face, is a meh product, leave a feel that i do not care because i do wash my face with another cleanser to eliminate everything. the other thing for me, was the smell. is pure oil smell. if you do not care, go for it. for me, my all skincare process is a spa type of feeling, and this smell ruined the vibes. plus, i live in ca and in a day that was like degrees, this stuff started melting all over because, again, is pure oil. so, hard pass!",negative
"it truly makes my skin feel plumper. my only complaint is the nozzle. i have to cup my hand around it so it does not spray everywhere, but i will not knock it down for that.",positive
irritated my cheeks. most likely due to the heavy fragrance. i care more about product performance than scent.,negative
"i received this product to try out and i have been so happy with it over the past three weeks! dermalogica has proven to be my favorite skincare brand. everything i have tried from them has wowd me and this is no different. this cleanser is so gentle that i use it both in the morning and at night. it does not feel like it is stripping your skin yet still gets it so clean. it has a very light, pleasant smell that is not over powering. a little goes a long way and the bottle will last a long time. after trying out different cleansers and trying to find one that is both gentle yet efficient- this is my winner.",positive
"it is okay. it is good if you are looking for an oil but it does not dry quickly. i have very dry skin, so i do well with lightweight oils. this one just does not dry fast enough. it is okay if i am planning to wash my hair right after or i am planning to keep my hair back but that is it.",neutral
i wanted to love this product. but for me it also stayed greasy on my skin and rubbed off in chunks,negative
"feels good going on but after a few hours a would feel greasy and uncomfortable. i also had to remove my facial oil from my routine to accommodate the richness of this formula. it is a quality product with good value, just not for me.",neutral
out of!!! i used this xs a week this summer and it helped reduce my oiliness and unclog my pores.,positive
"unfortunately, i have not had a chance to try the mask yet due to an allergic reaction from medicine. however, my year old daughter has tried it and loves it. she has been struggling with back heads and looking for a product that works without drying out her skin. she loves the mask, says it goes on lighter unlike the tar like stuff she tried before and loves how her skin feels after. she said it is so easy to wash off, and i appreciate the fact there is not scraps of make all over the sink. i think there is another yttp lover in this house.",positive
"i really did not notice a big difference in the reduction of redness, but the oil control was decent. i think i need more time to experience the full benefits of this serum",neutral
it is ok. i could not really see a difference. been using for about months.,neutral

"as someone that suffers from acne and oily skin, this is a must have toner. the makers at glow recipe explained the benefits of bha for those with oily skin because the oil-soluble bha helps to penetrate deeper into the skin. i did a trial run with the toner this week and the toner did exactly that unclogged my pores by pushing all the sebum and bacteria deep in my pores to the surface. my skin looks incredibly smooth and my hyperpigmentation has even lightened up some in just this one week of using the toner. this is definitely going to become a staple product in my skincare regimen from here on out!",positive
this cleanser was super gentle and felt really nice. i really loved that no fragrance was added especially because most products include fragrance now. did not give it a full stars because i have not tried it out for long enough but so far is nice. i received this product from influenster for free for reviewing purposes.,positive
"honestly, the best makeup remover and skincare cleanser i have used. it does take more product than i expected to get my mascara off, but honestly it gets the job done. for anyone interested, try using it with lukewarm water.",positive
"smells amazing, felt great on my skin, but i noticed i started getting small bumps and zits after using it. i started using it on my neck instead and i loved it that way. super fragrant so it was really nice to go to bed with that smell. for me the product was a meh, but i know it is worked for a lot of people! it did give a really beautiful glow after using it though!",negative
it feels great! super hydrating! my skin has been so much smoother with it. but the packaging is terrible! i went to open it and the entire lid came off and i lost about of the product.,positive
"i was so exited when this arrived in the mail. when i first sprayed it, it felt fine. however, after days, i realized my skin got so much dryer. this product dries your skin!! i seriously dislike this product. it also makes my face turn so red after i spray it on for about minutes. this was so bad for my skin. i do not know about others but this product did not work for me. i also bought it when it was dollars. i regret it. even if it was dollars, i would not buy it. if it was dollar, i probably would but for the spray not what is inside it.",negative
i received this product from influencer complimentary for my honest review and i was not able to keep using this product. it burns my eyes.,neutral
"i received this product for free to try, but i would repurchase. the granules are small, so my sensitive skin does not get irritated by it. i love how smooth it makes my skin look!",positive
"i love this eye serum, especially paired with my moisturizer. i have used a lot of eye serums and creams in the past and never really felt like they did anything. this one felt like it actually sank into my skin and reduced the puffiness that i get in the morning on my under eyes. i love the concept of a double serum, and i feel like it was really effective in getting rid of any fine lines that i might have.",positive
i got a trial size in a set and i am very unimpressed. the first night it made little bumps appear on my cheekbones where i have never broken out before but i kept using it because i figured my skin would adjust. my skin did stop getting the little bumps but after about a week i noticed that it was actually drying me out. fine lines around my mouthcheek area were worse than i have ever seen them. very bizarre. i would not recommend this for anyone with dry skin.,negative
loving this moisturizer! feels super silky and adds so much moisture to my skin. my complexion looks amazing too. do not need too much so i imagine this cute jar will last a while.,positive
i received a sample from influenster and was nervous to switch out my normal moisturizer. i decided to try using this at night to start. my skin drys out easily as the season transitions and this would be an exceptional indicator of a good mega hydrating moisturizer. i woke up with pleasantly softer skin! if your skin is oily i am not so sure it will work for you because it truly leaves a dewy glow in the morning. i have not tried it during the day because it is still hot where i live but it will definitely be my go to. i also paired it with the niacinamide serum. the photos are two weeks apart nighttime routine,positive
"i had the worst time finding a good moisturizer that would not break out my eczema and would moisturize my dry sensitive skin at the same time,til i tryed this!my skin had been amazing and have been using it for a year now.highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin or eczema",positive
i am so glad i got the mini first. this is grease city. i love me a thick moisturizer at night but this was too much for me. it never sets into you are skin and i had to wash my hands for how oily it was. big no,negative
all i can say is gross. felt like i was slathering vaseline all over my face. never felt a cleanser like this before. there was a thick film over my face after washing off. i even used my clarisonic with it and the film still would not come off. i would guess this is for very dry skin and for people who do not have acne prone skin.,negative
when i got these my expectations were low. i was expecting that noxema really strong scent when i opened them. there is a fragrance but it is light and i think it is pleasant. these feel nice and are not too abrasive. if you know that your skin responds well to glycolic acid this would be a great affordable product!,positive
"this label is grossly mislabeled.it did not remove my makeup, nor did it cleanse my face. instead, it left an oily film, and my makeup was still on my face just rubbed all over.how are so many people in love with this, i have no idea.",negative
"got this for my face, but realize it is best for my upperarms and legs where i have a little bit of kp and minor bumps. i can tell significantly the bumps are either minimized orand the area is soft. i definitely will buy again. i put it on my arms and thighs and buttocks before my lotions or butters. wish i took a photo ahead of time to show you!",positive
it feels amazing in the skin! and i really see a different email the next day!,positive
this product made me break out when i first started using it. i stayed consistent and eventually the breakouts calmed down and went away. i liked this product enough to finish the container all the way through but i will not be repurchasing. it is a thick consistency so i enjoyed using this at night. i worked it in as my last step in my night time routine and would sleep with it on. it def gave my skin a nice glow. but if you are combo or oily i would say this might not be the best option to use on the daily because of how much moisture it adds to the skin,neutral
"works insanely fast. use it most mornings. the smell is awful, but you get used to it. my esthetician told me i legit had a glow at my monthly facial. incredible product",positive

"disclaimer i paid for this product. scent scents tend to make me itchy but this scent was very mild- i just would like to know what ingredients entail fragrance. it dissipates quickly. pilling i found that it pills mildly with products underneath that do not moisturize enough, could make flakes worse.texturespreadfinish it is harder to spread if you have dryer skin or use products with cetyl alcohol a wax alcohol. the dew barely lasted and my skin looked dry as the day went. additionally the dew is best for smooth and young skin as it highlights wrinkles and texture. i wish that w dewy products, formulators took fine lines and skin texture into consideration. adults can be profitable clients too. also, please consider men use skincare too. eyes unfortunately yes, it irritated my eyes often! i was surprised. i found this product worked best with hydrated skin using humectant, squalane helps spreadability, moisturizer lock it all in, and some sort of texture smoothing ingredient that will not pill. for the texturizer i use a cheap cetaphil oil-free moisturizer with spf. i find this makes me look smoother, glowy, and the effects last sooooo much longer!! it also spreads more effectively. gr please take notice if this mix. cost over priced. niacinamide is a cheap ingredient!! the dew is short and must re-apply. no sweat water resistance claims so limited use. to make it work it requires more products so more costs.. oz is too little spf usage and price point. gr,. oz would have still left you with a high profit margin! this should be at least. ounces. what makes me want to wear sunscreen everyday? not breaking my wallet every time i reapply. ever consider that? i still recommend others give it a try though.",neutral
"i have insanely sensitive skin. the slight tingle. felt more like a burn. i tried to power through the burning feeling but noticed my face was also turning extremely red. i took it off with cold water, maybe mins after applying it. the next day my face had small bumps all over. i do not think my crazy sensitive skin could handle the product, unfortunately.",negative
"the packaging of this product is really high quality sustainable- i love the glass bottle. it has a very faint fruity scent to it. i thought the scent was really nice relaxing. however, i bought this right around the time i started experiencing the worst acne i have ever had thank you, face mask and this product did almost nothing to help with my breakouts over weeks of usage. if you are someone who is not struggling with acne, this product might be a great, gentle toner for you. but if you are dealing with acne like me, you might want to look for a stronger product.",neutral

"my skin feels great the next day after using this but it left my skin red everywhere i had applied. redness cleared up by next day as i used this at night. i did m for first use did not patch test which was silly on my behalf so if you have sensitive skin listen to the recommendation of m application. scent did not bother me actually, just smells more natural.",neutral

i have been using this cleaner for a couple of weeks and i am loving it. the fragrance is not strong but it does smell very good and it is actually been very gentle on my skin. it is creamy and does leave my face feeling nice and clean. it did however take me a while to get used to the bottle shape so as not let the cleanser drip.,positive
"i have been using the under eye cream and have always loved it. this one is having the same feeling to it. its very soft and hydrating texture. it feels refreshing, hydrating and like a little healthy glow to your skin. i have used it in combination of different serums and it worked great with my other skincare products.",positive
"i have come up with what it takes for me to buy and love a skinbeauty product product. it has to fall into one of the four categories below, ideally more than one. feels great to put on i want to enjoy putting it on. fast makes morning or night routine quicker. noticable skin improvement makes me look better. lasts a long time.this did not hit any of those for me. this was an okay product. felt okay to put on,. seemed okay with moisturizing, dried mostly quick enough for me to put makeup on over it, and i am not sure how it interacted with my skin- i did have a breakout but it could have been other things too. ultimately it did not fit into any of the categories above and did not because an allergic reaction so essentially i think it is an ok product just not worth the cost for me given all the good things out there. sending it back.",neutral
"the product seems pretty good, packaging is bad and i have heard from other customers with same issues. pump worked once before breaking and could never get to work again. not worth the risk to repurchase, plenty of other brands making great peptide creams with good packaging.",negative
this product helps to calm my acne. i use it once about every- days. a little goes a long way.,positive
i received this product free from isle of paradise to try out and review recently! i want to say first off the packaging is so cute i love it! i tried this out a bit and my skin got a little tanner from what i noticed! will be continuing it!,positive
"this was the first mask i have purchased from origins and was pleasantly surprised. echoing some of the comments here that it was a bit sticky for a while, including when i went to bed. when i woke up, the product had soaked in nicely and i was left glowing for the day and my skin looked even toned. i will definitely keep this one regularly stocked and rely on it for travel to drier climates. the scent from the bottle is a bit herby, but dissipates as you apply as there is no artificial fragrance.",positive
"this product just sat on my skin, never really absorbing. i did not think it moisturizer well at all, even though it is a thick cream. and the fragrance bothers me too, it smells strongly of oranges.",negative
"i was super excited to try this product, but it is mediocre at best. other reviews are raving about it taking off dead skin...however that is the product reacting to water....not your dead skin. if you are looking for something to remove dead skin, this is not it. this is a very gentle exfoliator but i have not noticed any glow from using it. the price point is great, but its great for a mediocre product sooooo...you can decide if its worth spending you hard earned money on it. i had really high hopes with all these star reviews but it was a disappointment for me.",negative
"meh it is okay. it works but it get sticky and slimy, i had to wait a while to add my facial oil. but overall it is good.",neutral
not my fav plus there is better moisturizer for less money.,neutral
"this is great for dry skin, and even oily.personally i have oily skin and this is just the right amount of hydration i needed for my skin",positive
"a great moisturizer for the wintercolder days! swapping this out for the summer, but i will definitely go back to this in the winter since it is super thick and moisturizing.",positive
"i got this as a sample. st impressions were it was instantly moisturizing and did not have to wait for it to soak in my skin. then i noticed the palms of my hands were very greasy and oily. i want to feel moisturized, not oily. i felt like i wanted to wash the oil off my hands but it would defeat the whole purpose.",negative
"this is an extremely thick cream that is quite hydrating. i only use a small amount of product apply to my face neck at night. i do not like that there is fragrance in this cream i am not too impressed with the formulas ingredients wish it had more clean ingredients. i have been using this product for weeks now, but have not seen any significant changes in my skin- but i have had some slight tiny breakouts that may be from this cream. the packaging looks nice, but feels kind of cheap. overall, i think this is just a decent product for a high price point. also would like to mention that i received this serum complimentary from influenster.",neutral
"i was super excited about this moisturizer as ole henriksen makes nice skincare products and this one seemed really intriguing. i like the texture of the product, which is a little firmerthicker than most moisturizers, and i liked that the smell was fresh and nice but subtle and not overpowering. i have oily skin but live in a dry climate so i need really effective moisturizers to keep my skin hydrated but not shiny. however my skin is very sensitive and that is where i ran into trouble. when i apply this moisturizer my face immediately turns red and stays that way for several hours. so, i could only use it at night, as the redness was gone by the morning and then maybe my skin did look a little more even. but there are other moisturizers out there that do not give my skin that kind of reaction, so i will not keep using this one.",neutral
after using this product my face felt extremely dry and stripped. i would never purchase this. have your time and skin!,negative
i got this free from influenster and tatcha for my honest review. i am and my skin is very dry with some minor fine lines. i have used this for about days now and my skin is definitely more luminous and hydrated. the smell is something you would expect from a rich spa experience and the packaging from tatcha is always done well.,positive
"i love the product but i hate the refill packaging! the original container dispenses just fine, but once i put the refill pack in, it stopped dispensing. i have to take it apart to get any product, which ends up making me get more product than i need and i waste a lot of it. this is frustrating considering how much this costs. i was excited when the refill pack came out because i hated the idea of wasting so much plastic with the original packaging, but the refill pack solution is awful.",negative
"i struggle with chronic mild-to-severe acne, and i was searching for a deep moisturizer that would not break my sensitive skin out. hearing such fabulous things about tatcha, i decided to spend points to get a sample size of this cream. i have only been using it for days now, and i will not be using it again. i do not know why people rave so much about the scent- it smells like vicks vaporub to me. it caused several dozens of tiny bumps to form all over my face just as my skin was clearing up, and made my acne flare up intensely. i am extremely disappointed in this product, and will now have to spend even more money trying to repair the damage this cream did to my face. wish i never tried this!",negative
"i love this product! as a person with oily skin, this mask really helped my oily areas and it really reduces the appearance of my pores. it really felt like it was working while i had it on, the cold feeling that you get really makes it feel as though it is sinking deep into your skin. after a couple of uses i felt my skin and my pores get a lot cleaner. the brush was also a plus when it came to applying this mask, because as you might know, applying try masks can be messy! i received this product for free for testing purposes, but i would definitely purchase again and i would definitely recommend it.",positive
"i received this as part of the complimentary summer prep vox box from influenster. this mask is so creamy and smooth for a clay product. i like that it is a combination of hyaluronic acid, rather than the acid alone, as i live in a very dry and hot area. it is quicker than most masks at minutes, and it is great that it can be used daily. i like how soft it left my skin feeling after such a short time. the toner sample included with it smelled so good for summer, and i could actually feel it doing something. i plan to buy that next.",positive
"the smell is nice and it leaves skin soft- it is great unless you. have to remove waterproof makeup and. have sensitive eyes. this burns my eyes snd makes the whole experience bad. i think the price is fair, it would last a while and would be great for light to no makeup days where eyes could be avoided.",neutral
this has been a live safer for my skin. it has helped clean my stubborn acne and clears it within a day. i will definitely be adding this product into my skin care routine. i received this product complimentary from murad skincare in exchange for my honest review.,positive
"while wearing it for the recommended time, it started to come off on its own. when it was time to take it off it was like i did absolutely nothing to the nose, the adhesive is not good at all, thankfully this was a sample, it is a c complete waste of money",negative
i have oily skin and this cleanser makes my skin feel super fresh and clean. i like the blueberry smell and the fact that it has aha in it it since i am using tretinoin and heavy chemical exfoliating irritates my skin too much so this does the trick. i repurchase for the second time. its kind of pricey fir how much you get but it is worked well enough for me to justify repurchasing. paired with fab coconut water cream my skin loves it.,positive
soooo nice and feels so good. although it did come with one side squeaking immediately out of the box but i dropped some of my argon oil just because it is what i have down into the hole on both sides and it worked like a charm!!!,positive
i really wanted to love this and bought it on an impulse. i should have read the reviews first. my roller does not work and no product comes out so i am returning this.,negative
this is a cleanser that leaves your skin feeling nourished and softened.the only thing is the smell it is a bit off putting. it smells like chemicals and odorous plastic that is the best i can describe it. i am happy it has no sensitizing ingredients that tend to smell nice but ugh why does it smell like that? honestly i still think it is a good product and i will continue to i use it till it is gone but if i can find a substitute that gives me the same results that smells better i am jumping on that bandwagon!,neutral
i have had better eye creams. it is very thick and sticky. i just have not gotten around to using it as much as i would have liked. i suppose it is a good eye mask for nighttime but it is not very convenient under makeup. meh. expensive too.,neutral
"using this feels like i dunked my face in a vat of butter, no matter how much i try to rinse after using. gave it a few chances but always ended up using another cleanser right after to get rid of the fatty residue feeling. it does get rid of makeup fairly well and i guess technically does not dry out my skin, but neither would basting myself in lard so not sure what that is worth.",negative
"i have been making changes to my skin care routine and nothing has been working, so i tried this because of the positive reviews. unfortunately, it did not work on my combination skin very oily t-zone. it just sat on my face and did not sink into my skin. at first i thought i may be using too much, so i reduced the amount i was using. but i still had to use a tissue paper to wipe some of the oil off. but on the other hand, it was not the worst face moisturizer i have tried on my new skincare adventure. there is smell, which is good for people who do not like scents and it did help some of my dry patches. it did not work for me but it seems like it does for a lot others so i would say try it.",neutral
"i love this product. it helps with under eye puffiness and helps to lighten the dark circles under my eyes. great to wear before putting on a full face of makeup, or just refreshing to wear in the morning while scrolling my phone. highly recommend and i re-purchase them regularly.",positive
i used this product for days my spots did fade but due to the arizona sun i feel like some have come back,neutral
i know everyone loves this product and i am a huge sf fan and i want to enjoy this eye cream so bad.... however it is just not for me. i have tried varying amounts and application methods but it just sits on top of my skin like a mask that should be washed off. i cannot wear concealer over it. it does not sink in. it pills under my eyes. i can see the tiny on my skin in a weird way. i am glad it works for other people as it is a lovely texture. i am just one of the few that it did not work for. going back to my beloved belif eye cream.,negative
love this moisturizer for night time. i wake up with hydrated skin.,positive
"made me break out terribly and was very difficult to wash off. i received this as part of a value set including the pads and pore serum, so glad i did not pay anything extra for it.",negative
"i wish the bottle was bigger for the price, but i like that it is sheer for my poc skin.",neutral
"i really enjoy this product. i purchased the smaller one because i have very sensitive skin and was not sure how this would react with my skin type. i had no issues with it whatsoever. it is gentle enough to use day and night, and leaves my skin smooth and soft. it defiantly rivals much more expensive products i have purchased in the past. will purchase again.",positive
i like how light this product was on my face and i also like how moisturized and soft it leaves my skin. i am definitely buying this ceramide night cream.,positive
"it feels nice on the skin, especially after being in the sun, but i have not noticed any differences in terms of my acne redness",neutral
did wonders for my dark spots! love how light it felt on my skin as well. will definitely buy again!,positive
i was recommended this and i found that it did not do anything for me. my makeup did not last long and felt it tinted my skin on the more rouge side.,negative
"not only does this have a great scent to it that i like! lemony-like it has also helped my skin so much! not only does it feel soft still, but has helped with some of my scars. noticed they are not so dark!",positive
this stuff is a joke. i would rather use coconut oil of the time. would apply and there would be no evidence of application within five minutes. does nothing for long term hydration.,negative
"so...i got it cuz the price is good and i thought it could be useful. but i just ended up wasting the money since it did absolutely nothing. i followed the instructions and even tried applying it again after it did not work the first time, still nothing.",negative
"i have been using as the first step in my double cleanse. pleasant smell. seems to take off my spf and makeup decently enough, not great. feels a bit like it is leaving a film on my face. my main qualm with this product is that it feels so challenging to squeeze product out of the tube, maybe i just have weak hands but you really have to fight to get even a little bit of balm out of the tube.",neutral
jury still out. it is a mist and expensive. product does seem to last quite a while as i use it morning and night after cleansing.,neutral
"i am not even sure if this product works well, as the smell was so outrageously overwhelming that i had to immediately wash it off. i scrubbed my face to death, washed it twice, put in a different lotion, and can still smell it hours later. there is no reason anything would ever need to smell this way. it is to the point where it makes me feel like i cannot breathe. awful.",negative
if you have oily or acne prone skin do not use this. even if you heard how good it is do not risk it. i have oily skin and i had really bad acne a year ago and i have did so much to get my skin where it is at now. i needed a new moisturizer and i heard this was a great one so i did my research and i decided to buy it. i wasted my money on this period. i am going to give it to my sister who has normal skin or my mother who has dry skin and see how they like because i most definitely not throw away my money,negative
"literally saw no changes when using this product. stars since it is affordable and has a good amount for the price, but it is literally just a light hydrating cream. i struggle with under eye darkness and some puffiness and the beauty advisor suggested this. i was misled. i still keep using because i do not want to waste it and i guess i am hoping for a miracle. it acts as a nice base to moisturize and prep my eyebrows though, before filling them in with powder. would not repurchase.",neutral
"i am not a huge fan of skincare with fragrance because of the acne implications. however, i felt like this mask had good effects, especially for the price. my skin felt tingly and moisturized. i did not experience any little red bumps in the coming days which is the norm when i use skincare with fragrance. overall, it was good for the price!",positive
i have medium skin with a warm undertone and this is not it for my skin color. it washed me out and made me look like i put something on my face that was a few skin tones lighter than my actual so it does not give me the no makeup look i was hoping to achieve. it works in minimizing redness but sadly this is only for light skinned individuals.,negative
this is the only mineral sunscreen that does not give white tint and makes my skin look healthierdecreases inflammation even after i remove it. i break out easily and it does not irritate my skin at all. my skin looks so nice with this sunscreen on even though it has low coveragedoes not really hide blemishes.,positive
wow. the only eye cream i have ever bought that is made noticeable improvements to my under eyes. highly recommend.,positive
"this stuff is so creamy and i love using it. i struggle with dry, tight skin in the winter and its greasy by the end of the day. this makes my skin feel clean and it does not dry it out like many other cleansers tend to do. definitely recommend!",positive
"not what i expected, it is like water or an essence. once i rubbed it in, i could feel a tiny bit of moisturizing, but it is definitely not what i would even call a serum. i will use it because it is inexpensive and i will continue to put my marula oil by the ordinary over it see if it makes a difference.",negative
love the products effectiveness! absolutely hate the packaging!! this needs to be in some sort of pump because this packaging leaks all the time. there is no way to close it where nothing leaks out! if anyone knows a way please respond!!,neutral
"i have been using this for weeks, it is a great feel and i know has the products to perform will. unfortunately, i have been experiencing small inflamed bumps on my forehead. feels good, smells gross but did not work for me.",neutral
i received this product for review. i do not think it did anything for my skin. the product may work for some but it did not work for me.,neutral
"i heard really good things about this product, reviews were promising and so i decided to purchase it. in all honesty, i felt like this product did not do anything for my acne... like nothing. there was no change in my acne, it basically felt and looked like i put a green color correction on my face and that is it. the price is not bad, sadly this product did not do anything for me.",negative
"i have to say i am a tad disappointed in this product. i was really looking forward to using it since i love the farmacy brand, however the results were not up to par with expectations. i always test out a product for at least two weeks before making an assumption for those who are wondering. i will start with the positive aspect and say that this is an awesome makeup remover. super gentle with a nice fresh, but not overpowering smell, that easily loosens up all makeup even that stubborn mascara. however, when i would try and get my eye makeup off, it left my vision a bit blurry afterwards and made my eyes a bit irritated. not horrible but not pleasant either. the other huge piece that i was missing was the cleanser part. now i think if you are a bit older in years and just need something that helps hydrate and is gentle on your skin, then this product would be perfect for you i gave this to my mom who is and it is been wonderful for her. i would say for those who still struggle with acne or face oil, this is not the one for you. after two weeks of washing with it, i noticed my acne coming back that i had long since gotten rid of. what i started doing was just purely using it as a makeup remover but then doing a co wash, which seemed to produce better results. so would i recommend this product? i will give a tentative yes if you are aware of your skin needs and use another cleanser as well. it is a beautiful product that has awesome ingredients and a lovely smell so it is a win lose in my book.",neutral
"i have actually finished this bottle and decided to write a review for those who might be on the fence. this facial spray was very average for me. i have some dry areas on my face and it did hydrate well but other then that i saw no real benefits. iit is not revolutionary. there were no major differences despite consistent use. it smells like chlorine which some people might like, but i did not find it very pleasant. overall, just okay.",neutral
"i have tried liking this. it pills after wearing it for an hour. i have tried it by itself, after serums, before make up and i get the same result. feels rough after wearing for a while, does not absorb fully, and if i tough my face it comes right off. huge disappointment",negative
"so this stuff is absolutely amazing for my face, i constantly have redness and it clears it up pretty well! it also makes my skin softer than it has ever been. the only downfall for me, everyone is different is the fact that it is such a heavy product it is like my face cannot breathe and it makes it super sweaty for whatever reason. it has a very strong earthy smell which i do not mind, but i feel it is going to be a problem for lots of people.",positive
super hydrating and glowy but i cannot wear it in the winter because it tints my skin so it does not match my neck.,negative
"i have oilycombination skin depending on the time of year and the mood my skin just happens to be in i live in the desert. i was wearing the original it cc and i would get oily even after a couple of hours, so thought i would give this one a try. it goes on much thicker than the original which is already pretty thick and does not seem to control oil while simultaneously clinging to any dry patches and making my skin even oilier over time??? would definitely not recommend for anybody who is susceptible to acne breakouts!",neutral
i love the feel of this but my face is on the oily side. i find that if i use in the morning i feel dewy during the day. i use at night and do not seem to have any issues.,positive
my favorite sunscreen yet no white case leaves a glow and does not peel it is amazing,positive
"i just cannot justify a. oz bottle of fermented water. i am adamant that an essence is not absolutely necessary in your skincare routine. i cannot see or feel a difference in my skin with this product alone. as advertised smoothing, hydrating, brightening...i do not see it. this does feel refreshing and luxurious on the skin! after this bottle, i will not repurchase. award winning and raved about by many celebrities and beauty bloggers.... great but i actually had to pay for my bottle. sorry not sorry. i have tried a cheaper essence from blithe or even fresh that completely changed my opinion of this step. i would rather spend my money on an essence that has a little more substance. to give a little insight, rice water is big in asian cultures. i have grown up knowing the benefits of rice water on skin and hair. in china, there is a village of women that wash their hair in rice wate and they are known to have strong long beutiful hair. amazing!!",negative
"i remember using this when i was younger and really liking it. got a sample in store and i was blown back by the perfumey smell of it. i like my skin and hair care to be fragrance free or have a mild fragrance, but this stuff is really strong. it is not a bad smell, just overpowering and did not really go away. not something i wanted to be smelling all day. i was disappointed because i like the texture and it blends in very nice. it does have a slight silicone feeling to it, but not as bad as some other sunscreens i recently tried.",neutral
"i enjoyed this moisturizer, however with a name like global protection day cream i assumed it had spf, and realized it did not after using it for a few weeks. either add spf or do not name it a protection day cream",neutral
left skin extremely red and did not see any reduction in pores size,negative
ok. i have finished my bottle of this facial cleanser. i will start by saying if you are into foaming cleansers this is not for you. i have drycombo skin. this cleansed my face real well but overall i prefer a foaming cleanser. one design flaw that sticks out to me is that the pump does not reach all the way down to the bottom of the bottle. leaving about a half a centimeter of product super annoying. bottle is glass beautiful packaging. just did not work for me.,neutral
"this stuff is pretty spectacular! i have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. i am not sure why but as i have gotten older, right under my cheeks have gotten darker. i noticed a difference after just uses! i will say this product tingles a bit but for me it lasted for just a few seconds.",positive
"while it definitely conceals redness and i like the ingredient list, for me the beige tint it changes too is way too light. i am not even very tan and it has the look of a sunscreen white cast. unfortunately i do not wear make-up regularly-if you did then you could probably bronze it up or fix with concealer.",neutral
i struggle with discoloration around my mouth. i have been using this product for about days and it is just made it darker. it was actually starting to lighten up with the stuff i was using but would not go completely away. so i decided to try to use this stuff. also i did i use sunscreen while using this product somehow it still darkened a bit.,negative
just horrible. full of artificial fragrance and stings.,negative
"i would read such rave reviews about this that i was looking forward to trying it but this did not work for me at all. the smell was nice and cucumber-y smelling but it never made my skin feel clean after washing morning or night. i felt like i needed to re-wash, even in the morning with no make up to wash off. i also broke out horribly the first month after using it, with this being the only skincare change i made i know better by now thru trial and error. sorry but i would not recommend for oilyalready blemish prone skin. not for me.",negative
i like the packaging of the product. it is clean and simple to locate directions on how to use and find ingredients. i did like the cream but it is too thick for me. i am used to wearing or using light weight water based products so i would not keep it using.,neutral
i have been trying it out for two weeks straight but unfortunately do not see much of difference. i really wanted it to work but for me it did not. my main concern is dullness and it says it helps you achieve a radiating complexion. it is very pricey so i am not sure if i would buy it myself.,neutral
"i do not know how much it does for brightening, i do not notice a difference. but man this bad boy can moisturize! i wish it smelled like watermelons but i can appreciate a fragrance free serum.",positive
at first i loved this! but over time i noticed my eyes eye lids getting super irritated and a burning sensation similar to the face lotion will not be re purchasing agree with others it is more so a highlighter with glitter in it. got it in a gift box so not sure if the products were from a bad batch but almost nothing has ever given me this burning sensation.,negative
"i received this complimentary from farmacy. it has a very soft sweet scent i think due to the fruit in it. the texture is like a mixture between gel and cream. it is a nice product but i believe it broke me out. i have oily acne prone skin and this says it is oil free but it may have just been too heavy for my skin. it does moisturize the skin. for what it is worth, i would not buy this.",positive
"i want to live this serum but i had an immediate reaction, a massive breakout on both sides of my face. i was using drunk elephants lower percentage vitc serum before had no issues. i am not sure if i should continue using it hope the breakouts go away or discontinue. has anyone else experienced this? otherwise, it absorbs beautifully i really like it.",neutral
"i used to really like this but after months of use i can say that this is just okay. price is good but i would rather pay more for something better. there may be itchiness, a normal reaction to aza, when using a fresh tube so this is effective. however, this pills under other products so not good for layering. when used as the last step of the routine, it just sits on my face and balls up when skin is accidentally and intentionally rubbed. i also do not like the packaging, specifically the flip-top cap, because it makes squeezing out the remaining product difficult. a small twist cap would be better. i do recommend this for those starting with aza but there are other better formulated aza products in the market.",neutral
"i usually buy the drops from isle of paradise and wanted to give the mousse a go. i was surprised how quickly it dried and did not feel extremely sticky. with that being said, i did get patchy spots on my leg. i applied it with the recommended glove and thought i got most of my leg saturated. i will give it another try, if it does not work out, i will be going back to the drops.",neutral
i had high hopes for this but it was very meh. did not notice anything extraordinary with my skin. got it as a sample size and did not even finish it.,negative
they clearly state that dark under eyes andor puffiness could be genetic. and it goes on to say this product can not fix that genetic issue. huge fan of honesty and from the company--keep up the great things. this product is great for actually reducing puffiness. my darkness is unfortunately genetic. but for the price i think it is still worthwhile.,positive
this does not absorb very well. i can use it at night but not in the morning.,neutral
"retinol- left skin looking plumper and softer the morning after using it. did not help with any wrinkles, discolorationhyperpigmentation nor texture on my skin. it lasted me months, i applied it to times a week, only at night, using half of a water droplet for my entire face. smell and color of the product were not a problem, and packaging is travel friendly and easy to use.",negative
"i really was not expecting to love this. i am absolutely a skincare snob, and insanely picky. i have somewhat acne prone very dry dehydrated skin, i picked this up as part of the canada day sale for since i figured for the price i would not mind trying it. my skim gets very flakey, dry and sensitive from tretenoin use to limit aging and this feels wonderful on my skin and works amazingly under makeup or plain old sunscreen no weird sun screen pilling. i love to be dewy, but love that i do not find this makes me feel at all, my skin looks quite matte and just feels insanely soft like a very soft leather jacket or a rose petal. wonderful. does not make be greasy at all. ended up buying more as i am sure i am going to blow through this stuff at lightening speed, especially once fallwinter hits. would recommend to anyone needing something highly moisturizing, non-greasy and unscented.",positive
"two stars because it smells amazing, but it does absolutely nothing for my skin. it is just sticky good smelling water. it does not seem to do anything bad but it just does not do anything at all... and now i am stuck with a bottle of scent. cannot wait until i am finished with the bottle so i can throw it out and move on.",negative
"i have always been happy with any fresh product i have used. but from the smell almost waxy strawberry smell to the cystic acne it brought on did not have it before this product, cleared up after this product and while sufficiently scrubby, it just did not feel clean as a standard exfoliate. it was like the sugar was just for show- just did not seem effective. truly shocked at how much i disliked it.",negative
i love this moisturizer. it is so expensive but i have not found a dupe that works as well as this does! left my skin moisturized without feeling dry or greasy. it is lightweight and melts into the skin wonderfully.,positive
this product does not melt into your skin! omg i have tried many cleaning balms but nothing like this. it leaves a film on your skin even after washing it off.,negative
unfortunately this one not for me! i am using his peel and love it so give this one a try to combine with it. i do not feel particularly clean and it made my skin dry and dull.,negative
"not a bad product, but not a great one either. do not use more than drops, otherwise it will be impossible to get it absorbed. normally more than ascorbic acid will make my face burn but this percentage is fine",neutral
smells like expired perfume in a very dated fragrance. texture was not at all what one would expect. not a fan. will not be purchasing after trying the sample. bummer. i was excited about this one.,negative
"i have difficult skin to please. it is dry, oily, easy to break out, and since i am in my mid s i have to worry about upcoming wrinkles and elasticity. this is a light cream cleanser i use every morning prior to my morning skin care routine. it is light enough to remove my excess oil without stripping off moisture that my skin needs.",neutral
"used this stuff for about days and my eyes just kept looking darker and darker. even my boyfriend noticed and said i looked tired, and that is saying something that man notices nothing. i was putting it on my upper lid and on my undereyes and looked like an extra from the walking dead. i tried so hard to give it a chance but could not keep going, went back to my old eye products and within days was back to normal. such a huge fan of glow recipe but this product was not for me",negative
"i wanted to like this product because it was hyped for. but unfortunately the packaging really made the experience unpleasant. all the previous reviews about the packaging were accurate on how difficult it is to get the product out of the tube. no matter how much is squeeze it, the product will not come out. i would have to unclog it with a q-tip every time i use this product. inkey list should of put such a viscose product in a jar or make the tube opening larger so it is easier to use. the packaging is a real bummer.",negative
"pretty color and nice smell, but really does not do much. this mask leaves my skin soft, but that is about it. it does not seem to help large pores or do anything for my uneven texture and acne scars. overall, i have not been impressed by this product.",neutral
"this product did not work for me. it seems like it made my acne worse. it may be great for others but i have used this product for months and after i stopped using it, my acne started to clear up.",negative
"i wanted to need this so bad... i bought it to layer with my skinfix moisturizer at night, but instead my skin wakes up feeling dry. not paper dry, but not plump and hydrated like it was without the honey halo. the scent is awful, but goes away quick i think. it also made the skin around my eyes so dry and flaky... definitely a return.",negative
"after reading great reviews i thought i would try this out, especially since its such a low price. i have sensitive, combo, and acne prone skin and thought this product would help, but sadly it did not. i tried it for a night and did not see that much of a difference but the second night i used it i had little red bumps and itchiness all over my cheeks and chin. my acne is not that bad, more scarring than pimples, but this product made my skin break out and feel rough. so disappointed and returning this product.",negative
i just started using this product and i am really enjoying it so far. i was worried it would have a strong smell but it does not. i have sensitive skin and it did not make my skin red burn.,positive
"first i like how you just press down and the right amount of product comes out, a little goes a long way. i like how it is cruelty free reel, feels good going on but moisture did not retain as well as i did lie. especially for a night crew,i received this for free from influenster in return for my review",neutral
"this product was given to me for free in exchange for my honest opinion. to say the least i really enjoyed this moisturizer. first it has sunscreen which is really nice when you have products that give you some more protection from the sun. it is also a moisturizer that hydrated your skin. but is also a skin tint as it is a color control moisturizer. when it comes out of the packaging it is white. but as you blend it into your skin it changes to your skin tone. it does leave the skin shiny, i believe because of the sunscreen but i loved this product.",positive
i am not normally a balm cleanser fan as i feel my skin needs a second wash. this one is different though. i use it alone on foundation free skin and as a pre-cleanse when i wear make-up. my sensitive combination skin loves this cleanser!,positive
"i think this is a really cool idea- however, i did not like this stuff. first off, it does not work well with oily skin. secondly, it leaves my skin super sticky after use, for a long time too. i tried using just a tiny bit thinking that maybe i was over-doing it, but it was still super sticky no matter how little i used. it is just...not great.",negative
i just had to go to the dermatologist because my skin broke out. the doctor said these products are not regulated in japan the same way they do in the usa.,negative
"i had high hopes for this, but i really did not love it. one pump certainly goes a long way, but i could not get it to easily absorb into my skin. once it was absorbed, it felt nice and lightweight, but it left an obvious white cast. i am not sure i will be able to finish this bottle.",negative
the fragrance is too intense for me and caused my skin to break...so bad. very happy i only bought the little one because i would have been very disappointed to pay over for it. not for my skin but does not mean its not awesome for someone else!,negative
"so good for the price. i have tried several chemical exfoliants and i am always on the lookout for my next favorite. these pads are really good for people starting out with exfoliants or if you just want to try them. i love that they are affordable but actually exfoliate without hurting your skin. some people use them in the morning and at night but i recommend that if you are starting with chemical exfoliants, have dry or sensible skin only use them one time a day to try them out and give your skin a break to process the chemicals. i personally use them once a day because i do not want to over strip my skin of the little oils it produces.",positive
i received this sample from influenster i really like it but i can tell a difference with just one use however my face did feel clean but i feel there are more affordable products that do the same,neutral
"was going to wait a few more weeks of use to review, but this is the only tatcha creammoisturizer that i have tried that works quicker than i expected! i have dry combo skin. the water cream did not do anything for me at all not even minimize pores, love the dewy cream but it is just great at moisturizing me at night so far, but this silk cream really made a visible difference on my skin after a few days use! at night i use the rice polish after oil cleanse, then tone with son park beauty water, pat on the tatcha essence, farmacy honeyglow aha serum, tatcha silk eye cream, then the silk cream alternating with dewy cream at night. my skin texture has smoothed out so much, feels so soft, silky and glowy. i can even use the silk cream during the day, it does not make me oily later as i use a mattifying sunscreenprimer under makeup. keeps me moisturized and skin ready for makeup. i balked at the price too, but it works for me and has fairly clean ingredients. love the scent too, very comforting as all other tatcha products. i am sensitive to scents, but tatcha products are ok. great investment for me. it may not work for everybody, but something worth trying if you are considering it.",positive
"this was gifted by glow recipe exchange for a review. this product does not state the percentage of niacinimide. i actually reached out to the company via email and they refused to answer. they gave me a canned response about how the percentage is not important, it is the combination all the ingredients that matters most. well, if you have a sensitivity to niacinimide over then the percentage is very important. as a result i will use this on my body and not my face.",negative
was not a fan of this at all. it was too heavy and did not sink into the skin at all. i do like thicker creams like the tatcha dewy cream and think it is much better. not worth the price i am going to and i prefer the other skinfix moisturizers lotion and cream,negative
i had read all the reviews and was super excited to use this product but i found it to leave my face feeling like it had left a layer of product on my face. it just never seemed to leave me feeling clean and refreshed. plus the smell was kind of strong and usually i am not bothered by smells. great reviews but for me. it was not awesome!,negative
love this product! i have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin after using this product-my skin is smoother and clearer than it ever has.,positive
i would not consider my skin super sensitive but whenever i apply this i notice my face starts to burn that same evening when i put on my evening skincare. i solve this by diluting a few drops in moisturizer but i would not buy this again. i notice no major difference in my skin.,negative
"i have been using this fab cream for almost a decade. i have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream- i have got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. we have bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime. this used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns- dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, everything. the scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. holy grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. welp. over the last year that is almost all changed. the fragrance is more or less the same, but i suddenly noticed my hands and face were not staying as nice as they used to. my family agrees the cream is not soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. the texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. once it is rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. i cannot tell what they have done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. this product used to be five stars, now it is one. a pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. i also want to note they have raised the price on the oz tube by twelve dollars over the last six years- and i would still be willing to pay if it was not worse than a drugstore product. but as it stands i am heartbroken. do not waste your money.",negative
"first i will start with what i like about this oil. the smell is heavenly. the consistency is smooth and does not leave a heavy feeling or oil slick on my face. what i do not like the price tag is rather inflated. the gold flecks are for looks only, they are not small enough to be distributed onto the face for any kind of extra glow affect. and my biggest complaint, for a product, i did not expect the lid to breakcome apart days into using the product, or at all for that matter. i keep my products stored in a temperature controlled environment and am nothing if not gentle with every product i have invested my hard earned money in. so i thought that was pretty pathetic for such a high end company and high price tag product. i had to put my oil in my own bottle to continue to using. all in all, the oil itself is indeed very nice, i have yet to notice any actual difference in my skin compared to using an oil half the price. so i will not be re-purchasing this particular product again,",neutral
great cleansing gel. now that i have used a gel rather than foam or soap i am loving it. it gets all the makeup off my face wo harsh stripping ingredients like most face soap. it is also great smelling and easy to rinse off.,positive
"this restored my skin. i use it with the face wash as well and i went from cracked, dry, flaky, red skin that was breaking out everywhere to smooth and healthy skin again. cannot recommend highly enough.",positive
"this is a helpful product-- my skin likes it and it has actually improved the texture of my face. it is expensive, but i am willing to pay for it. here is what i do not like-- i cannot get the last worth of product out of the bottle or dropper. tried turning the old bottle upside down on the new one-- but days, no progress.",positive
"the only moisturizer that has ever worked on my skin. my skin is plump, texture has reduced and i feel beautiful",positive
got a sample of this from buzzagent was excited to try. does not because those small bumps some other cream does. a little goes a long way but no major changes.,neutral
"i am only one day into using it which may seem risky already writing a review but if have sensitive, acne prone, textured skin, but it!!! i have acne scars and bad acne in general and i came across this product and it was affordable so i thought i would try it. i put it on before bed and i put it on a patch of my skin just to test it. i put it on a huge problem area on my face where i had this huge pimple. it does tingle a bit which worried me because i have super sensitive skin and when products tingle it either means it is working or it is going to harm your skin even more, but it did not tingle to the point to where it was uncomfortable, it was not painful. i checked my face the next morning and my pimple went from a bright red huge lump on my face to a small light pink spot! i was so surprised! as for texture, i did not see too much of a change because i only did a patch test but maybe if i apply it on more parts on my face i will see a bigger difference. as for acne so far so good!!!! buy it!!! if you are hesitant it is cheap and we all have to start somewhere, everyone is skin is different!",positive
i have been wanting to try this cleanser for a while and while i was not disappointed i also cannot say that i was blown away. it is a foaming gel-based cleanser that can be used on all skin types and it claims to not strip or overdry the skin. what i liked about this cleanser is that it does remove my makeup well even after a first cleanse which is a must for me for those lazy days where i do not double cleanse. i also liked that this cleanser has a nice lather and i did not find it drying or stripping for my oilycombo skin. the only downside for me with this cleanser is the scent a mix between laundry detergent and baby powder. i typically do not mind fragrance in skincare products but i do prefer that my cleansers have a more mild scent otherwise it feels as though i am washing my face with perfume and i do not get that clean feeling afterwards.,neutral
"so, the texture of this moisturizer is amazing. it feels balmy on the skin, hydrated but not oil-dense. my dry skin is more than happy with it as a day cream, and i can imagine an oily skin type would love it as well.however, the scent. it is very intense, and downright distracting, as it lingers for quite a while. i am incredibly disappointed, as i love the texture so much. unfortunately, i will not continue to use it for this reason.as someone who does not shy away from a product simply because of fragrance, i figured i would be fine. i was wrong.",negative
pretty good cream. been using this for a little over a month in the morning and notice that my makeup stays on longer and my skin is much softer and glowing. i do not have as much dry skin even during the colder times.,positive
"noticed a difference after the first use!! it did not even turn my face red and my skin is super sensitive, so finding a product that does not make my skin red while exfoliating is super rare for me and this is why i am rating it stars. this stuff is amazing. if you are hesitant, i say get this. so worth it!!!",positive
"it is ok. i would not recommend using this first to remove makeup as it does have particles in it to exfoliate and i would not recommend getting this near the eye area, removing eye makeup, etc. i found it to be ok, but drying to my skin. my skin felt very tight after using it. note i do have dry skin. i did not find this moisturizing at all. i got this as a sample and the sample bottle is a bit stiff so it does take some pressure trying to squeeze the product out from the sample bottle. smells ok.",neutral
"i have tried so many different ways, but as soon as i put my sunscreen on top, my entire face flakes sooooo much. the vitamin c just seems to combine so poorly with my sunscreen or even moisturizer and creates all these not blended flakes on my face",negative
was not a bad moisturizer but the container has a bottom in it about half way up so it is actually even smaller then it looks. i know the ml are listed but it is way smaller then i thought.,negative
"i feel like this is a bit overhyped honestly since i have not seen much change with my skin, and it is extremely sticky. the dewy glow you get is just from the sticky residue and it feels like it just sits on your face. it smells reaaaly good though. also helps keep your skin pretty moisturized too.",neutral
"i love this product functionally. it absorbs well and somehow keeps my skin hydrated without making it oily. however... not sure if there is something wrong with my batch, but the fragrance smells like vinegar",positive
"hello, i have oily skin hence i tried this out as i loved the unsunscreen one! i would wait mins plus to settle my oil free moisturizer, this sunscreen and then my primer and foundation. it sadly moved my foundation. not a fan! i prefer their main one!",negative
it really stings when you initially apply it on your skin. have not noticed much change in my skin,neutral
"yes. yes. and yes. if you are looking for an easy technique to treat your skin from dullness, even out texture, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and help repair that gorgeous face of yours this product is for you! super easy to apply. i squirt about three pumps and evenly apply it to my face throughout and wait for minutes until i rinse it off. this is not your typical mask- the layering of this product is thin enough it just feels like you are applying a light coverage lotion which is not greasy or overbearing. it has a slight tingle sensation but goes always after a minute you apply it. the oil that comes with it too is not greasy whatsoever- i just squirted a pump of it on after and rubbed it in giving it a nice refined finish. love it! the packaging and branding of this product is adorable and fun! i highly recommend.",positive
"i have been wanting to try la mer forever. mainly because halle barry. but her skin is just flawless no matter what. the product smells like something my granny would use, the scent is full on if your sensitive to scents this is a no go. it is super thick. i applied it as directed by warming it in my hands first i tried it directly onto my face. it does moisturize for hours.however i am also wanting something that feels amazing while applying. this does not.tried it will not buy it again",neutral
"i was left with pretty severe dark spots and hyperpigmentation due to years of ongoing problems with acne. in recent months, i have tried everything to help fade these spots but i saw little to no change. let me tell you, i was extremely hesitant to buy this given the price but the reviews convinced me to take the risk and i do not regret it. in the first week of using this product, my spots have faded so much and my skin looks brighter and more even overall. this vitamin c serum does not pill like others i have tried and does not have any weird smells like most do. so happy i discovered this!",positive
"i would not use everyday. do not be like me who did that. i am very oily and it dried me out. however, it is very nice on the skin and does the job.",positive
this product did not work at all. i used it times on the same pimple and it is still there,negative

"i received the revitalizing supreme youth power creme sample free from influenster andestee lauderin exchange for my honest review.most skincare requires a few weeks to a few months to see actual results, so with this tiny sample i can only give my first impressions of application and ingredients. the cream spreads easily and smoothly with a bit of slip that most silicone makeup primers have. it leaves skin feeling moisturized and sealed. it smells very fragranced, and i worry about the jar packaging for light, air, and bacteria exposure. any beneficial ingredients will likely break down over time. as for ingredients, the list is very long! we have no idea whether any past the top few have enough included to make any difference in skin. the top ingredients are water, silicones, and penetration enhancers, hence the silky smooth texture. after that is a bunch of potentially beneficial peptides, plant extracts, and other actives, but also plenty of fragrant plant extracts and actual fragrance. if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, as even natural fragrances damage skin barriers. it is nice to see that the moringa and hibiscus flower extracts that are prominently advertised are further up on the ingredients list. personally, i am not sure i trust the less studied plant extracts for anti-aging as much as some of the highly studied workhorse ingredients that are further down the list, like hyaluronic acid, vitamin e, squalane, and caffeine. i think this has a potential to be a great moisturizer, but is overly fragranced for me, relies too much on silicones to give a temporarily smooth feel to skin, and unfortunately comes in a jar that will not keep the long list of potentially helpful plant extracts from degrading..nofilter gotitfree complimentary free influenstervoxbox complimentary influenster contest esteelauder skin skincare esteelauder esteelauderxinfluenster",negative

"this product is perfect for adding a little hydration in the middle of the day, or helping your moisturizer glide a little easier by spraying on beforehand. i have to be honest, the smell is a little gnarly. the sake smell really does smell like fermented wine in your face so if you are at all smell conscious, i may choose a different product. i have not noticed a wild improvement in my skins moisture levels since using this but it does add a bit of a pick me up when i notice my skinmakeup is looking dry around lunchtime.",neutral

"i have used almost all the bottle in a very quick amount of time. the packaging is not good, the pump does not work properly and the liquid is too thick for it so its spills around the rim of the bottle wich dry and become a paste. such a waste. it did not help to even my skin ton either. very disappointed.",negative
"this moisturizer is so beautiful smells great and does what it says. you are for sure dewey all day. however due to the high dimethicone levels, my skin broke out in tiny bumps every time i used it. i wanted to force this into my routine and it is just not working. however it is very moisturizing. i did feel sometimes like it sat on top of my skin but my fave overall felt quenched. just could not manage the break outs and went back to my old moisturizer and the issue cleared itself within a week. i had the same issue with the water cream. while i love their other products the moisturizers do not work for me. i also think it is weird that they get the sephora clean rating with such high dim levels.",neutral

my pores got clogged i had to deal with breakouts every time i tried it. bad experience,negative
i believe this product has been helping with fading my acne scars. i would not recommend this to people with sensitive skin and i would not recommend people to use it everyday. i use it once or twice a week and mix it in with my moisturizer and it applies great. i do not use it often but it still does the job for me on other days i use ascorbic acid from the ordinary.,positive
"i mostly use product labeled as fragrance free, but i received a sample of this and gave it a shot. first, to me, the fragrance is quite noticeable. are not no plum smell like that. this smells like nyquil. not here for it. second, so much skincare has hyaluronic acid in it at this point, and the effect of plumping is mostly temporary and cosmetic, that not only are you likely getting the ingredient from multiple sources, it just does not seem necessary to have a dedicated serum that again smells like nyquil. third, the reason i gave it three stars is despite the sickly smell, the serum did make my skin look very beautiful. i cannot and will not commit to a product that has fragrance in it, but i did like how this looked on my skin. layering it under moisturizer i did not care that it was a bit tacky.",neutral
i would give this negative stars if i could. i have the absolute driest skin in the world and use so much moisturizer and so many hydrating products that it is not funny. i have never before had something that made me feel so greasy. this did not sink into my skin and hydrate at all. this was like putting a layer of vaseline on my face. i have never wanted to wash my face as badly as i did after putting this on.- stars,negative
"it does its job, it takes all your makeup off and leaves no residue. but it made my skin break out. i have not had a breakout in years after going on accutane and after adding this oil to my routine i had broken out. i have not used the oil for the past three days and my skin is almost back to normal. i really wanted to keep using it but this is not the product for me.",negative
"i currently use and love vinopure natural salicylic acid pore minimizing serum, so i was eager to try the toner from the same line. not really amazed by it. sure it tones and cleans, but felt too soapy for liking. it may be better for others, but i love my facing feeling tight after toning and before applying my moisturizer.",negative

"after reading all of the wonderful reviews i was really hoping for something great but this did not work for me. it helped a little with puffiness and moisture for my dry under eyes but it wears really poorly on my skin. sadly, i broke out each morning after applying it. i tested it near my lips to see if i could be reacting to another product but it gave me small pimples near my eyes, upper cheeks, and lips. this is also impossible to wear under makeup because even the smallest amount will not absorb into the skin and it leaves little patches of product on the skins surface that pills terribly when applying makeup on top. i tried using it as only my nighttime eye cream but it causes other products to pill and it still does not absorb into the skin by morning. i returned it after weeks. i have used dermalogica multivitamin powerfirm for a couple of years and it is good but i am still searching for the right eye cream for me!",negative
i love the consistency of this cream. i definitely wear it in the pm when i feel like my skin is stripped from winter realities dryness because of weather and heater. would definitely recommend. my skin is combinationdry! i put this on my hands as well sometimes,positive
i have been using this moisturizer every night for months and love it. i have combination skin that can lean towards dry and this stuff is amazing. it is deeply moisturizing and does not because breakouts. i used it over the winter on my annual trip to canada and it is the first time my skin was not dry. the only drawback is the smell. it does not smell great but the results are fabulous. i highly recommend it.,positive
i got this products from influenster to try for free and i tried it it seems to clog up my pores a little bit did it break anyone else out? smells good goes on smooth not too thick maybe i am applying wrong i am not sure or maybe it is just not right for my skin type i would not buy this product again only because it is not good for my skin,neutral
"i redeemed this serum for points. i did not think it would work on me. many caudalie products just break me out or do not do anything at all on me. but omg i have been lonving this so much. it minimizes my pores and if i have a minor break out, next day it looks almost like nothing. really good and the prince seems very good. usually serums are very expensive. the scent is very pleasant too, not sticky and absorvs super fast. will purchase full sized",positive

love the application and consistency. ease to maneuver under the eye. does not break me out or burn. but i am unsure of how i feel about this eye balm? i do not feel like it super hydrating and lasts as long as it says. i have not noticed any difference of any kind around my eyes. only time will tell i guess.,neutral
"i wear these so the thicker end is by my crows feet as opposed to the thicker part being beneath my eye and cover of my cheek!. i do not have a problem with slippage at all, and leave them on until most of the product is absorbed and the patch is dry usually a few hours. my eye area is noticeable plumber and more awake after removal. i am not sure if they would have long-term effects, but they sure feel nice and i will continue to purchase. they seem pricey, but when you compare to other eye patches that are for a single use, the price per pair is not terrible. i want to try the gold ones next.",positive

i would not recommend this for anyone with dry skin. i wake up flaky after using it. i feel like the retinol upside is not worth the lack of hydration for me personally,neutral
"so i tried this innisfree pore clearing clay mask and it is not bad. it might have helped my pores a little but it caused a bit of redness, but that is typical to a certain degree. i mainly did not like the fact that it has some ingredients that are not clean to me, like pegs, drying alcohol, walnut she will powder which can be abrasive, etc. at least there is no parabens or sulfates or other bad ingredients that i do not like. i just wish it was cleaner. it is a good price for what you get it is only for. fluid ounces. if they worked on the ingredients which would also help with my somewhat sensitive skin, i would definitely give this a higher rating. i appreciate getting this gifted by innisfree for my honest review.",neutral
"this toner is gorgeous and smells really good. i am not sure if i just need to use it longer but there has not been a noticeable difference on my skin, though it does feel strong upon application. i received this product complimentary to test.",neutral

"this moisturizer is probably better suited for dry skin. i have combo skin that is prone to breakout and it did not work for me, it made my skin greasy. it is also a little heavy on fragrance in it, and the price is too high for what you get.",negative
"this smells terrible and actually gave me a headache! i am not smell sensitive at all, but i had to wash this off after about minutes. i had hoped this would be able to replace the argon oil i usually get from josie moran, but as good as the reputation of the ordinary is and as cheap as this product was i cannot recommend this for the skin not the hair. if i could give zero stars i would.",negative
this moisturizer is thick and well hydrating! it is a great under the makeup moisturizer if you have dry skin or if your skin after makeup is applied seems to get dry in the climate you live in. i wish there was not added fragrance in this along with a few other unnecessary ingredients that are harmful to our skin.,positive
no just no. save your money. it smells bad and way too overpriced,negative
"i have been using this cleanser for two months now and really enjoy it! it removes all of my makeup, including waterproof eyeliner and mascara, and it is gentle on my skin. i purchased the smaller size to try out first, but will definitely be purchasing the large size.",positive
"made the skin under me eyes extremely red and inflamed. i tend to have sensitive skin, but this is pretty bad to happen after one use.",negative
"horrible product, it is so clumpy and hard to work with! would not recommend.",negative
"got a sampler for this with my sephora order. day was ok as i applied it after washing my face. day, yet again i washed my face and applied it. within mins i had at least red spots on my face and within the hour they all broke out. now i have to make sure to take care of these breakouts before i can do anything to my skin. have not done my am and pm routine as i do not want them to get worse. hopefully they will subside.",negative
i bought this to try out because i am getting married and i wanted to have whiter teeth. i noticed a difference after one use! i love this whitening pen i take it with me everywhere.,positive
it is very good. very good for dry skin. put it on damp skin,positive
mineral sheer sunscreen-this is a sheer facial sunscreen that blends right into the skin! it does not leave a greasy feeling and does not give my face a white appearance while i am wearing it. it actually works perfect under my foundation!,positive
"too light for my type of skin, which is oily. i also do not like the way it feels on my skin, a bit sticky.",negative
i have a very fair cool toned skin tone and the only coverage i need is for redness not blemishes. this product seemed really exciting as an alternative to tinted moisturizer but it functions in the exact same way. the green turns into a light peach tone. if you are wearing a face mask all day you can see it rub off as a peachorangey color. not a bad product just was not expecting it to be an oddly marketed tinted moisturizer. if you are pale and most face products show orange on you i would steer away from this product.,negative
"i feel pretty indifferent about this. i have been using it for a few months and it is just a straightforward cleanser. it did not feel too tight after using it, but i did not feel like it was nourishing either. i can definitely do without the scent, which can be a little overpowering. it was fun for a while but i probably will not be purchasing this again.",neutral
"so this was my first foray into retinoids, and went in thinking this was going to dry the heck out of my skin and make it peel but that definitely did not happen. it is light and actually very moisturizing. when i wake up my skin feels firm, and blemishes are reduced in size. the best part about it? the price. you just cannot beat having an effective retinoid that costs less than. i do not think i could live without this now!",positive
"i got a sample size of this as part of the sephora sunscreen discovery set. it adds a nice glow to the skin, but it pilled pretty badly on me. i do use moisturizer under my sunscreen, but it is not very emollient and i do not apply any foundationbase products on top.",negative
"i am a big huda beauty lover but when i saw the wishful brand, i stayed clear of it- i do not think a makeup brand can have a decent skincare line. i placed an order from huda on black friday, and got a decent sized sample of this moisturizer with my order. fine, i relented- i am not one to let free samples go to waste. i used the sample like twice before i wanted to throw all my current moisturizers out and buy this. i totally did not need more moisturizer but i cracked- take my money! i came to sephora and bought this full size... and a gift set with another honey balm and some other wishful products to try. i love it. i cannot even explain. it feels so lovely, and though those with scent-sensitivities will hate it, i love the smell. if i really think about it, and touch my face now it is mid afternoon and i applied the honey balm this morning, there is really nothing stellar about it, but i still cannot help being addicted. i am really excited to try the other wishful products and to see what else is released from this line.",positive
ok at removing make up but each time i use this my eyes get cloudy and a white reside forms in the corner of my eyes... i also get make up residue when using micellar water afterwards,negative
i received the product as a gift from the brand. i have been using it am and pm for several days. it absorbs in quickly and does not feel greasy. my eyes are hydrated and lifted. i would definitely continue to use it and recommend it to my friends as well.,positive
my skin is very sensitive i love how this clarifies and does not flare up my redness! works wonders!,positive
"at first, i fell in love with this cream. it really helped the redness in my face, and the dry patches i started getting this winter due to living in the dry desert. but after a week or so, it started clogged my pores like crazy. i started getting bumps in places i never have before, and a lot of them too! i did not want to believe it was this moisturizer, because i really liked the other aspects of it, but after taking a few days off of it and then adding it back into my routine, it is definitely this that is causing my comedonal breakouts it also seemed to make my face dryer in some areas, and oilier in others, which was kind of weird. not for me i guess!",negative
i really wanted to love this product. i am months in to using it and still waiting for miracles. i honestly feel like it is the same as splashing water onto my face. looking forward to being done with it so i can move on to trying a different essence.,neutral
"i like it but i do not love it, i have used it consistently for about a week now and i have noticed a slight shine to my hair that was not there before but it was a huge difference. there is a smell but after you run it through the ends of your hair it immediately goes away. make sure to completely blow dry your hair after using orbit will make it extremely oily!",positive
"i received this freeproduct with trywithtopbox for my honest review, it was a small sample size of ml or.fl.oz. i used this serum for a total of times, once in the morning and twice at night. i noticed a slight smell and the consistency was nice. the first time i used this product at night i used it with the other, same line, eye cream and creammoisturiser and found my face feeling very sticky! i tried using this serum and the eye cream together but with a different moisturiser and my face felt really smooth and not sticky! something to do with the combination of this serum and creammoisturiser for my skin just does not work, makes my face feel all sticky. but using them individually andor with other productsbrands seem to be fine. in the end i would not recommend this serum and that is just based on that it does not seem to work with their other same brandline of products.",negative
"this is a great cleansing balm! some cleansing balms burn my eyes but this one never did, and it was great at removing even waterproof mascara!",positive
"folks, this stuff is amazing!! i got a trial size last week and i am loving it so far. it is not greasy at all but it is moisturizing enough for the dry parts of my face. my combo skin is very happy. also, it is like silk under makeup. so far no breakouts using it, and i will come back to update on more long-term benefits.as for the smell, you guys had me almost not buy the stuff, thinking it would smell like feet from across the room! it is absolutely not an issue. you have to really stick your nose in the jar to smell it, and even then it is just a little play-doughy. this is just what un-scented cosmetics smell like- the ingredients that are in them, without being masked by horrible perfumes. definitely recommend, even if i do find the price a little high.",positive
"i have a lovehate relationship with this product. it gives my face a nice golden glow, does not make me breakout and its not overly scented. however, it is terribly sticky on your face which i hate and its stains literally everything. i have learned to use a buffing brush to spread it because i always somehow ended up with it staining in between my fingers, on my knuckles,",neutral
"the first night i used these, i put on dots. the smaller white heads that were on the surface of my skin on my jawline seemed to respond to the dots as advertised. the deeper under the skin whiteheads had no reaction. one small pimple seemed to come to the surface quicker later in the day the morning after using these dots. a couple cystic pimples on my jawline had no reaction at all. one pimple on my forehead appeared flatter but there was an obvious red circle from where the dot was that lasted all day. so, truly these are hit or miss depending on the type of acne you are treating. also, these stuck firmly on my face through hours of sleep. i probably will not buy these again simply due to the return on investment very little results for the price.",neutral
holy grail right here. i had not told my boyfriend that i had been using a new product and he commented on how the dark circles under my eyes were gone and my face looked great. i jumped and cheered with joy! while on vacation with friends i had three other people try it and they all fell in love and saw a huge difference with just one application. they have all since bought and use this product as well. the fact that it is also a clean product makes you feel even better. the power of plants!,positive
"i am so thankful that dermalogica gifted me their multivitamin mask. this is the perfect winter staple. filled with antioxidants, it gives your skin a healthy boost. i love the texture but most importantly i love how my skin looks after. plus it feels so soft and plump.",positive
"i started using niacinamide after trying the one from glow recipe, i have combination skin and realized this helped balance my overall oiliness and helped control my acne, definitely an ingredient to keep using. so i tried this one to save some money and it works well, but it pills up when used with other skincare, i have to use this serum on its own with only moisturizer on top, anything else makes it pill. it also stings a little bit. i am not sure if this is normal for niacinamide but the glow recipe one never caused this so i may just stick with it. but in general this one serves its purpose for the price point.",neutral
"excellent product and value! i love this stuff, started to see results very quickly, almost eliminated the acne on my very acne prone face even though i am pushing made my skin look great!",positive
"i got this as a free sample to use. i am in my late s and have hormonal acne. i usually use the clinique system but substituted this for a week to see if this made a difference. i did not break out during that time and my acne was nicely controlled. i also noticed that my pores were a lot clearer and this helped with blackheads. however, after about a week, i noticed irritation, itchiness and redness on my skin. i was using moisturizer and making sure my skin was nicely hydrated during that time, so i think it was this product that caused issues for me.",neutral
"feels luxurious and is really hydrating, but i do not see a difference in redness or texture. i still love putting it on, probably will not buy again though especially for the price.",neutral
"i am, fair skinned, and have really severe hereditary dark circles and eyelids.. so you know i have tried a million different eye creams. this one is very thick and hydrating but it has not done anything for brightening another downside is that i have only been using for a little over weeks and i am already half way through the bottle with only using a pea size bid. it also only seemed full when it was new?? for that reason i cannot justify repurchasing and waiting longer to see results. disappointed i definitely recommend trying the saturday skin one instead, that is the only eye cream i have ever noticed any difference in brightness although subtle.",negative
"this is definitely moisturizing and non-irritating. it has definitely remedied the hyperpigmentation affecting my undereyes, as well. however, all it is done for the fine lines under my eyes is make them so. much. worse. they are incredibly pronounced now, they have increase, and now at, i look like i am in my mid-s. i have only been using this for about weeks or so. disappointing.",neutral
"the key to keeping my oily skin happy is a good moisturizer so that it does not produce more oil and a polypeptide moisturizer is one of my absolute favorites! the derma e one is my go-to, but it is definitely on the thicker, creamier side, so it can be a bit much for summer, and that is why this one is so perfect! it is so light, an almost whipped-gel sort of texture, but still manages to hydrate so deeply, keeping my skin way less oily than it used to be in the summer. i would definitely recommend it over the drunk elephant one, if you are in the market for something that leaves your skin plump and happy! my mother has super dry skin and she loves it too, so yttp really hit the nail on this one.",positive
"before i start this review here is a quick disclaimer about my skin i am quite honestly horrified by it. i have nearly every possible skin problem except for it being oily. it is extremely dry, so sensitive to everything, extremely acne prone and is always breaking out, and it has lots of fine lines despite me only being. so when i tried out this product as a birthday gift sample i did not have the highest hopes for it. i rarely use cleanser which i know is bad but in my defense, literally everything i have tried has given me massive breakouts but this surprisingly did not. while it made no improvements to my skin whatsoever, it did not create a reaction which i am thankful for. it also did not dry out my skin which was great considering that my skin really does not need to become any more dry than it already is. final thoughts after using for a month twice dailyi doubt i will end up purchasing this again due to the price but we will see. overall i would definitely not say that this product will help to improve skin in any way but if you have really sensitive, acne-prone skin like me, it at least will not make your skin any worse. if you have reached the point where i have, in which you just need a cleanser that will not ruin your skin like everything else has, but you also understand that nothing is going to improve the quality of your skin except for maybe lots of money spent on facials and prescriptions then you should maybe consider buying this.",neutral
i have used this for years and loved it until the new formula and colors were introduced. the new formula is terrible. it goes on thick and does not blend. leaves your skin looking splotchy and streaky no matter how much you try blend it. please go back to the old formula.,negative
"estee lauder always reminds me of a brand my grandmother would use. with that being said, i was still excited to receive this sample for my review. it is an interesting moisturizer because of its color and consistency. it definitely gives you glow vibes as it is gold and seems shimmery almost. it was a nice nightly moisturizer for me, as my skin can get super dry and a lot of stuff tends to pill on me if i am not careful what skin care items i am mixing. it smells super light but this will not be something that takes the place of a current product. i was still happy to give it a go!",neutral
"it does remove all make up but not easily--i find i have to do a lot of scrubbing with this stuff to get everything off, and in spite of the scrubbing, my skin does not feel super fresh or clean afterward so i usually feel the need to double cleanse. i typically look for a cleansing oil or balm that only requires one step, because i am usually pretty tired by the time i take my makeup off. will not be purchasing again.",neutral
"i was excited to try the free mini of this, because it seemed like a high-end version of another cleanser i already love, pacifica kale detox. the smell in this was disappointing, less like a green juice and more like a green... water. i have sensitive, oily problem skin, and this cleanser was a bit too gentle to really do the job on its own. it also does not seem to go as far, either because there is less lather, or because i found myself needing to re-wash my face. i also think the glass bottle is not a great idea for slippery bathroom areas with hard floors. it may work for you if your skin is more dry and you do not wear much makeup or spf.",neutral
"good, not great. i have combination, acne-prone skin and i hoped this product would help with some acne scarring and textural irregularities, but i cannot say i noticed any difference. i think my pores were slightly smaller after using this, but i did not have any other improvements. this may be better for someone just starting to use acids, but otherwise i would recommend the aha peel instead.",neutral
"the texture is pretty creamy and reminds of a medium weight moisturizer. being that it is labeled as an overnight treatment, i as expecting it to be a heavier consistency but it was not. i tried using it alone and over moisturizers. i found using it alone did not do much for my moisture levels. the next morning my face did not feel like it retained any extra moisture. this is why i prefer to use in conjunction with my regular night creams. for someone with combo to oily skin, i think i would prefer to use this in the summer when my skin does not need as much moisture. scent wise it has a very light floral scent that i like.",neutral
"i absolutely love this! i normally do not use bb creams because they are too sheer and i want more coverage. this is wonderful. it is buildable, lasts well, and has a gorgeous glow. i have been asking the girls at work what they think and it is funny because i have received a lot of random complements from people. i will definitely be buying this again!!",positive
i was super suspect about ordering this from previous reviews of poor quality and squeaking but i am so glad i went through. i roll x a day with the fresh face oil and swear i have seen a change in my skin. the roller is great quality too,positive
"i did not see any difference! for the price, i expected better... i applied it daily and saw no change...",negative
i have been using this for days and my skin looks so good!? like it is so calm and unbothered and smooth. i pick at it almost daily and i have never had anything heal it so quickly before. it is a teensy bit greasy so i use it at night or on the weekend when i do not need foundation. it smells slightly of honey and nothing else. will be buying the big jar next time.,positive
this product contains benzyl alcohol which can be extremely drying and irritating to skin and because inflammation and damages the skin barrier.,negative
"horrible. pills instantly and flakes. even if used alone. does make your face look glowy and does not leave a white cast, but pills horribly, especially on the neck and hairline. will be returning.",negative
"i did not find this as an asset to my routine at all. it did not do anything good or bad it just did not do anything for me- but! it did actually make me reach for my niacinamide from the ordinary again because i realized that one did help more then this one, at a fraction of the cost.",neutral
bought this because i liked other things from this brand. when i received this it was opened and used. gross.,negative
"it is fascinating to me that this cleanser is so well reviewed. three stars because it definitely removes my makeup, but it also smells like crayons and dries out my skin. i have used around cleansing oils and this is in the bottom five.",neutral
"it is nice. however i do not find this oil super hydrating for dry skin. it is a very dry oil. i would recommend this for a more normal skin. or someone with oily skin who wants to try oils. it does sink quickly into the skin. does not really have a scent either, which is good.",neutral
i received this product for free from influenster. i love this product so much and enjoy it using it every single night! makes my skin feel amazing!,positive
"my new favorite serum! it is a total game change for your skin. soothe skin and repair the skin barrier with the serum that targets dehydration, irritation, and redness, helping skin to return back to normal. plus the size is perfect and the package is so beautiful.",positive
worked pretty well at first but feels so stripping. my skin felt tight dry after each use. also dried out my skin like crazy to the point where i thought i had rosacea!!,negative
"absolutely horrible. tried to make it work for weeks and the entire time i broke out in horrible cystic acne. my friend loves this stuff and after reading the reviews, i thought it would work well for my skin concerns. i have pretty mild acne, but a lot of dark spots from old acne and dull skin. it did absolutely nothing, it would tingle for maybe seconds and the next morning my skin would look worse. it would look even more washed outtired and i would have a new cyst. i hoped maybe my skin was purging because i have gone through that before with new products, but after weeks my face is covered in horrible acne.",negative
"i use a dermatologist prescribed retinol for almost years now. so my once oily skin is drier than the sahara. i wanted some deep hydration that lasts all day. thought this oil serum would do the trick but i was sorely mistaken. it just smells nice and that is about it. the packaging is also quite lovely, but when you pay almost for a luxury serum, you expect it to do what it promises. it sits on the skin like any oil, however unlike other oils, it is hydrating effects only last about an hour after application. and then it is like you never put it on. so i will be returning this and going back to my holy grail serum combo of estee lauder advanced night repair serum and anadlou naturals coconut milk serum.",negative
i hate to give just one star because i cannot tell you if the actual product was good or not because the smell was just so beyond overpowering that i could not bring myself to use it more then once! it smells like old lady perfume...the scent is extremely strong and it lingers. i returned this to the store.,negative
i really enjoyed this eye mask for my eye area. i liked how it is individually wrapped so you can pack it to go. my eyes instant feel hydrated and helped de puff my eye bags. i liked the fit of eye mask as most eye mask i tried does not have a great fit.,positive
"i love so many products from the ordinary, but my skin hated this product. it was the only new thing i added recently and suddenly i was breaking out.",negative
this is a lie. when i tell this product is not for sensitive skin. i will not come back to this product because of the damage it left on my skin. i will for now on stick to my regular product that are not on this site.,negative

"obsessed with this sunscreen! it is so hard to find sunscreen that has active skincare ingredients in it but this one does it all! it feels great on my skin and does not leave any white cast even with the spf. i struggle with hyperpigmentation so the niacinamide in the formula is going to be perfect to treat it. overall, i am really happy with it and cannot wait to use it everyday now.",positive
"freeproduct trywithtopboxcircle. i tried this a couple times. i admit i was excited to try this product. i am years old so i need help to prevent those dreaded wrinkles and fine lines loss of firmness etc. well first off the smell is very strong did not like it, nor did i like the fact almost all the oils they have are hydrogenated like why? no wonder i am breaking out. hydrogenated oils are not good for you or your skin. those are the two things i did not like about it. now it did leave my skin feeling nice and smooth. did seem to maybe help tighten the skin but again it is probably temporary. now i do not want to waste it. so i will keep using it till it is gone. maybe my skin will finally get used to it",negative
"i have been using this eye cream pretty regularly since receiving it. this is a light eye cream that absorbs easily, and can be worn during the day. i have found that it helps reduce the appearance of concealer creasing. it is lightly-scented, but it has not irritated my skin or eyes. i do notice a difference on fine lines, which appear less visible.",positive
"these help my eyes look less puffy when i have late nights. i use them when i am getting ready for bed right after i wash my face. i think they do work, they feel slightly tingly and warm on my face but i enjoy it, others may not like it as much. only stars because of the odd sensation.",positive
i have combination skin. my forehead is very dry and thought this would help. after using for weeks morning and night nothing has changed. for the price it did not work for me.,negative
i love this product- even though it does have fragrance in it. i like the bonus of spf as well.,positive
meh... the eye mask is ok. i did not feel or notice a difference in my skin after using. my eyes do have tiny fine lines and i wake up with them being very puffy. when i use these they go on cold and heat up pretty fast. i have a hard time making them stick to my under eyes. i also do like to put them on first thing in the morning while i go over a few emails. i would not repurchase.,neutral
"this product was not the worst, but it also was not the best. it has a very strong, earthy smell, and a smooth, creamy texture. it applies nicely although feels a little dry, almost papery almost when it dries down. my skin had minor noticeable changes even texture and less discoloration, and if i had not used other serums that worked better in the past, i may have given this a higher score, but it did not fully impress me or surpass those products. also, when i received the bottle, nothing would come out. i opened the top and noticed nothing was attached to the pump so i had to turn the bottle upside down for product to enter the pump trying to tap it out without the pump on was not working. for the price, i expected much more.",neutral
"the moisturizer is very nice, but not worth it for the price in my opinion. i found it took a long time to absorb into a combination skin compared to my first aid beauty coconut water cream. it is too expensive for the quality in my opinion",neutral
"i just started to use this product, but the price was amazing and i think my under eye area already appears less puffy!",positive
"i bought this on a whim and was not sure if it was even going to work or not given on how mixed the reviews were, but all my life i have had such terrible bloating to the point i look pregnant whenever i eat i decided to try. i still bloat but i notice my stomach flattens out within an hour or so after eating which is amazing! it is helped my self confidence so much. i would recommend taking it either right before or right after eating to avoid nausea",positive
feels refreshing on your face.,positive
this is a game changer. i use it almost every day and i have noticed such a difference in how my skin looks and feels. and yes i have used it on a plane and i loved the results. i never used to get compliments on my skin and now so many people comment on how much i am glowing!,positive
"first, i want to say i am not a professional when it comes to skincare, i am not paid for this review, and i do not work for any skincare company. i am a normal woman that deals with skin issues like all of us. my whole life i have had serious acne issues and facial texture. nothing compares to this product. it helps with pore minimizing, finally takes care of the texture you can never get ruin of, and it is so easy to use. it does not leave a film or anything on your skin. pay this! it is worth it.",positive
"i had been seeing this product from many influencers and wondering. i started to use and it is totally waste of many.. it smells very bad. i have not seen any good effect on my skin. on the contrary, i had acnes. i definitely do not recommend. do not waste your money!",negative
"does a really awful job with eye makeup, whether or not it is waterproof.this might also be breaking me out. i started using this with some other new stuff i stopped the other stuff to see if it was this balm but i still see some, although fewer, little red bumps on my cheeks which are not normally there.",negative
not a fan of this face wash. it cleans well but has a weird smell and does not do anything for my skin. overall just an average cleanser,negative
"i was so excited to try this. however, i have no idea how to actually get any product. it is sealed up tighter than a drum. i even watched the short tutorial on the kiehls site and still nothing is coming out. so annoyed that i have to solve this problem.",negative
"i found that salicylic acid which works really well for my acne so i gave these a try. i would not recommend it for sensitive skin though. when i would remove the patch the next morning, i would have a red circular spot where the sticker was. i do not think the actual acne fighting ingredients caused it but rather the sticker itself. it takes at least a day for the redness to subside. this is just how my skin responded to it but it does have good ingredients so i imagine it works well for others.",neutral
"i absolutely love this product. love it. i give it stars because of the packaging- the pump completely stopped working. i tried fixing it myself, but no luck. i still have tons of product left in the bottle and i have no way of getting it out at this price point, i hate for this to go to waste- so i have been unscrewing the top and using a bobby pin to try and scoop it out. hopefully de is working on an updated bottle!",neutral
"i have heard great things about this so i really wanted to like it but it dried out my skin so badly it started to flake i have oily combo skin by the way. it took several days to repair the damage that two tiny drops of this made. i thought it was reacting with my cleanser but nope, i tried another cleanser and it did the same thing. i am not any more sensitive than the average person even if a product has fragrance my skin can take it. i think this product is either a hit or miss, and i would suggest to stop using it as soon as your skin starts to reactflake, trust me it will not get better over time.",negative
"i really had high hopes for this when i bought it. i always double cleanse and use a cleansing balm as my first cleanse to remove light makeup and my sunscreen. this one leaves a film on my face which is not too much of a deal breaker as i use a foaming cleanser as a second step. the deal breaker is that it does not remove all of my eye makeup mainly mascara, and none of my eye makeup is waterproof. while i could go back with an eye makeup remover i do not want to add another step to my routine when i know farmacy, then i met you, and banila co. all have a cleansing balm that removes waterproof mascara. in short i will finish using it, but i definitely will not be repurchasing and sticking with the ones that i already love.",neutral
"i have dry rosacea skin with dermatitis. this does moisturize my face fairly well. however, after the second time using it made face started reddening more along with getting a few red bumps not acne or pimples, and it gave some uneven texture to my skin. i feel it is the rosemary, boswellia serrata, tasmannia lanceolata fruitleaf and ginger extracts that may be causing this. i say these because i have used products with the other ingredients that are in this. i cannot state that everyone that has the same skin conditions as me will have the same issues for everyone responds differently. but it was worth the try.",neutral
"absolutely love this cleansing balm. it is affordable and works really well, removes all impurities, make up including waterproof mascara and it lasts you a real long time. i have been using it for over months and have not even made a dent in it, a little product goes a long way! highly recommend!",positive

"i have been testing out this product for the last week. i use it every morning and every evening before my moisturizer. it has kelp in it, which you can definitely smell, it is a very green, aquatic scent to this serum. i think my skin is more glowy, for sure, and it seems to hold moisture in better. i really enjoy this serum as a part of my routine. is not sticky or too thin, and it fits into my routine perfectly. it does not change the way my makeup looks, either.",positive
"i started with the retinol reform which i love, which enticed me to try this moisturizer and the eye cream. i actually really like this moisturizer- it is light weight and is non-irritating i have sensitive eyes. i was surprised by the matte-ish finish i should not have been surprised, it is oil-free after all and prefer something a bit dewier, but that is just a personal preference and easily remedied by adding a couple drops of face oil. however... the packaging makes me so sad. i know that pumps are more hygienic, etc., but man, i feel like i am going to end up tossing so much product simply because i cannot the remaining moisturizer out of the container. the sharp edges of the bottle square vs. cylinder do not help. the packaging is keeping me from repurchasing.",neutral
"when using this product i did notice a difference in my acne over night. it was able to help, but after it is applied it is very stick so you have to use it before you sleep. it also might leave a grease over your face in the morning if it is not washed off. i have had this product for a year and it ended up crusting around the original cap, which i have no idea why so i threw the cap away and used the other one that is provided. i think this product is not the best of the ordinary, but it is okay for the price. please leave a helpful if you found this helpful lol.",neutral

only use if you are double cleansing with a gel cleanser after. it is only good at breaking down makeupsunscreen but very difficult to rinse off completely. leaves alot of film no matter how much i try to rinse it off. so many oil cleansers that even the price point does not make it worth it. cleansing is supposed to remove product and dirt and not require a second cleanser even if you were already going to double cleanse.,negative

"nothing special, regular wash... does nothing to my skin.",neutral
by adding a tiny amount of water after a few minutes it emulsifies and works wonders taking off the makeup. it also gets rid of my black heads and i can literally see them on my hands afterwards. i have massaged it into my face for over mins and i think the longer i massage it in the better.,positive
"i really enjoyed this product a lot until i put concealer over it. i tried different concealers and they looked so bad over this, they all caked up and accentuated my under eye lines so badly. i was really bummed because i love how it looks and feels, but for the price i need something to work well under makeup as well as on its own. i do think this will work wonderfully for some people. sadly returning this one!",neutral
"i spent a lot of money on this moisturizer after it was recommended by a sephora employee. i have very very dry skin. amazing moisturizer and truly leaves the skin feeling plump and hydrated. what i did not expect was that no matter how or what i do to apply it, it starts pilling up and i can scrape the layer of moisturizer off. such a bummer since it leaves the skin so nice and has been one of the best in that moisturizing aspect but i cannot apply makeup nor do anything to my face after applying this moisturizer without wiping my face off prior to.",negative
i really thought i was not like this eye cream. when i initially bought it it was smooth moisturizing i loved it but after a while after dipping my fingers into the jar i feel like it now has a hardness to it so it is hard to scoop out and when i do scoop some out it is kind of coagulated. i feel like chunks fall off i feel like i need to rub it between my fingers to warm it up. i would not recommend nor would i buy again little disappointed.,neutral
this is the best!!!! it has a nice tint that blends in very nice. this is the best i have tried and i have tried many high and low. i only now use nothing but peter thomas for my skin care.,positive
i got a sample of this. i thought it smelled like wet bacon but that does not bother me. i am more concerned about how my skin will react and how it will work for me. i wore it for days and after those three days i got like pimples. they were not just any type of pimples they were sore red itchy pimples. could not pop them but they were there. i know it was not anything else i used because i stopped all the other ones breaking me out. the texture is nice. like almost slimy consistency. layered well under makeup. but not the best vitamin c i have used for such a pricey tag,negative

i only have used this product once and i can already tell the difference in my skin it got rid of all my dry skin that all other products do not remove.,positive
"let me start by saying, i do not often write reviews and i have nothing against this brand. i have loved other supergoop products. but this one is terrible. well, it is more that it is a great idea poorly executed. where do i start? i got this for recent trip to the beach in mexico. first of all the pop up part of it where you have to push instead of rolling it up is problematic. i pushed, not very hard, and the entire contents came up the top. then when i try to push it back down the whole top crumbled off. there was a little bit left to salvage but it was not pretty. so i put it in the freeze well, it is more that it is a great idea poorly executed. where do i start? i got this for recent trip to the beach in mexico. first of all the pop up part of it where you have to push instead of rolling it up is problematic. i pushed, not very hard, and the entire contents came up the top. then when i try to push it back down the whole top crumbled off. there was a little bit left to salvage but it was not pretty. so i put it in the freezer to harden enough si that i could push it down again so i could close the top then tried to be very gentle with my push-up and the same thing happened again. i get the feeling that this would only work if it was not hot, but problem is that most the time when you are worried about getting a sunburn it is going to be hot out. heat definitely affects the consistency of this and your ability to utilize it at all. it might be in improvement if you had the product twist up, but i still think the consistency in the heat is too greasy and it crumbles too easily.",negative
"this is my first review and i felt that i needed to share my experience with this product. when i initially purchased it i was in love, i could not believe how great my skin felt! now that i have finished the bottle almost months later i feel like it really is nothing special. i almost wonder if my initial response was just myself wanting to so badly love it and give a reason to why it is so expensive but sadly i will not be repurchasing it. i just think you could get the same results from a more cost effective moisturizer. i have seen no overall improvement on tone, texture or firmness... so all in all i think the protein factor is a great selling point but it is pretty much bs sorry!",neutral

"i received the microderm instant glow exfoliator gifted by goopglow to try out and leave my honest feedback. i really wanted to love it since i have been a big fan of their other products, however, it just was not love for me. i tried it a couple of times a week for almost weeks and the biggest downfall is the smell. it smells like plastic almost, hard to explain. maybe i received a bad product but it really bothered me. i have done microderm facials a few times but the exfoliator in this product just feels slightly too rough- even with really gentle use, it agitated my skin. i will say that it got rid of the blackheads on my nose which is why i am giving it stars, but based on the agitation and scent- i would personally skip this product.",neutral
lightweight and moisturizing. i love the scent and feel of this mask. my face feels pretty hydrated afterward.,positive

besides giving a good all day glow this serum makes the pores look blurred almost like a putty primer. it gives a bit of warmth when applied to the skin just like i find the resveratrol serum does.. but the biggest thing i have noticed is my marionette lines are so much plumper and less visable. this product produces a really quick improvement in skin quality overall that i have already purchased a backup after only weeks of using consistantly. that says something!! absolutely worth the price. fyi antioxidants applied right before sunscreen can help boost sunscreen effectiveness by up to.,positive
"do not try and unscrew the powder portion for if you do even the slightest, it will get all messy and the powder will slowly start to spill out. during the time i did use it, yes i felt a powder on my face but was unsure about the sunscreen. the powder did not do its job for i found myself resetting it a lot. overall, if you like a sunscreen powder, then this is for you. i just recommend to not wear a lot of makeup if you choose to use it.",neutral

"generally, i have combination oily skin. however, it has been a bit dry at times this winter. i have been using prima afterglow moisture for a little over three weeks now. upon putting the afterglow on, it was smooth. it was thick but not too thick. i would put the moisturizer on under the night glow. i felt like my skin had a natural glow afterwards but it was not too oily. my skin absorbed the product well. i noticed that this product helped with the bit of dryness i was dealing with this winter. a little of the product gies a long way so i can see you getting at least three plus months of use of the product. my only con for this product is the smell. it smells like an herbal product which i was not a fan of. the smell does go away after a few minutes though. i have sensitive skin and the product did not make me break out.",positive
"i was gifted this product by drunk elephant in exchange for my honest opinion. the protini resurfacing serum is overall a solid product, but i do not think it is perfect for me. on first impression, our serum had a minimalist, if not plain packaging. i will admit that it took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out that i needed to rotate the top half of the bottle to make the pump accessible. i am not a fan of the smell, the scent is very reminiscent of you beautys resurfacing compound and is very chemical smelling. although i have been using this product sparingly, i have felt minor irritation every use. i have very sensitive skin so this is nothing new, but i have not found a specific reason for the mild but uncomfortable feeling. anyone with sensitivity to lactic acid may want to steer clear of this one. despite feeling irritated in the moment, i have noticed positive effects the day after use. my skin looks and feels brighter and smoother. this will never be a skincare staple for me for a few reasons, but it might be a holy grail for someone else. as a side note, i was incredibly disappointed that influenster sent this product in a beautiful, psychedelic colored box when it is so plain.",neutral

i think it worked just fine for me. but the smell smelled like dish soap. and every time i cleansed my face i thought of detergent. if has a light lemony smell. not bad at all. just felt like why would i pay bucks forsomething that feels like detergent. so i returned it. because i felt like neutrogena does the exact same job for cheaper and neutrogena has a better smell. i wanted to try something high end. so instead i got the tatcha rice wash. and i love it. it makes my face so smooth.,neutral
"it is alright. does the job of removing makeup and i think it is pretty good removing waterproof mascara. however it does not emulsify as well as other cleansing balms and it feels like it leaves a strange film on the my face but that is okay since i immediately use a cerave face wash afterwards. also if you wear contacts, i would recommend taking them out before using this. does not matter how tightly i close my eyes, this seems to get gunk in my lenses and dries them out. it is alright for the price but the ponds balm, which i usually use, is- depending where you get it and that is way better.",negative

wanted to love this so much makes my eyes super itchy and irritated. i also feel like the consistency of the cream makes it harder to blend outsink into the skin.,negative
"for a serum i expected much better. this smells nice, but frankly does not offer or really do anything else. purchased once and finished but will not repurchase again.",negative
"product is literally a water cream, when you rub it in it turns into water. it is not hydrating enough for me, but i have dry skin.",neutral
i do not get the hype surronding the product. its a cream that feels heavy on the skin and afterwards i feel like my pores are not able to breathe but are clogged instead. it did not fulfill my expectations.,negative
"i am a fan of the brand, and i have liked the facial oil, eye cream, and retinol serum, so i really wanted to like this moisturizer but i could not get over the funky smell. i like lightweight gel creams, so the texture of this one is good, but it definitely has a weird smell that put me off it.",neutral
"this product is straight up oil, i do not know when everyone decided that oily is dewy but it is not you guys! pull yourself together. it also broke me out, granted, i have acne prone skin but the acne flare up this caused me was crazy! took months and four facials to fix this situation.",negative
"this is sticky and tacky. i mixed it with another toner to see if that would cut its stickiness. no it made the other toner sticky, or rather, the toner i created was sticky and tacky. when i used this before bed i could barely sleep because i was so aware of the yuckiness on my face. i ended up throwing it and what i would mixed it with away.",negative
"i am a master esthetician and this is by far my favorite cleanser. not stripping, soothing, literally melts away any makeup and impurities including my waterproof mascara, and gives my skin the best glow and feel after. i have acne prone skin as well and this does not break me out or agitate my skin at all. i use this morning and night and will continue to use it always! the best!",positive
i am leaving stars because the over all quality of the product is good. it has a nice foamy lather and a light scent. but unfortunately it just did not react well with my skin. i broke out all over my face with tiny pimples that have yet to go away. my skin type is oily and acne prone but i have not had a breakout in years. i love de and i use a bunch of their products but this one is not for me.,negative
"i have tried this cream multiple times, wanting to fall in love with it. every description i have read where they hated it, was precisely why i was so adamant of giving it a shot. it is rich which i love. it is almost oily feeling on the skin another big plus. i just hate that i cannot even use a dollop on my face without completely clogging my pores and having a zit come visit me the next day. this is a neck and chest cream and that is it. do not put it on your chin or your nose or your cheeks. stay away from your forehead because you are funna find a zit in the next few days. i have used this in combination with other things. i have used this with nothing else and only used a rice grain amount. i spend too much for my skincare routine to waste time on something that will clog my pores. no no no.",negative
i have been using this product for about weeks and have already noticed a difference. i feel dark spots are no longer as prominent as before. the product goes on smoothly and has a good overall feel. i have noticed that my overall skin tone has became more even less redness in the cheeks.,positive
"polyethylene? ilove all the other ingredients, but polyethylene is the th ingredient. that is a plastic.",negative
"woah this is an awful, shamefully overpriced product. it applies unevenly no matter what you do and pills horrifically. the glow makes you look orange and sparkly. for this price, you can get a wonderful, higher spf is bleh that will perform better. supergoop is so gimmicky and grossly overpriced. if you are an year old kid you may love this, though. adults pls pass on this, trust.",negative
great product. easily to apply and get your daily dose of retinol. love the container and packaging. would highly recommend to help bring life back to your eyes.,positive
"i got this to use as a face mist during work when my no makeup face feels dry... it feels great at the moment you spray it on and has a pleasant barely there scent and a nice fine mist. however, it is basically spraying water to your face, which is drying like the feeling you get after you wash you are face with water. it did not work for the purpose i bought it for, but it does set powder foundation pretty nicely when used as a makeup setter.",negative
"awful. fall down,did not see any changes after use. the only plus-they are beautiful and sparkling. never again. save your money",negative
love this lightweight serum. its not very oily so great for sensitive skin. the bottle is so pretty too. i have been using this for a few weeks now ans has not caused any breakouts. will buy it again.,positive
"i was really excited to try this, but something in this line did not agree with my skin. it made it really red and irritated. i thought this luxury brand would not be so harsh and irritating. i was wrong.",negative
best self tanner that not leave your skin orange it is lightly smell but it is ok i mix it with moisture together,positive
"i just got this for an exchange of my honest review. first thing first, it is a mineral sunscreen everyone looking for a good one. i like the finish of this, leaves my face dewy yet not greasy or heavy. if your concern about white cast, you just have to be patient and give it a couple minutes. blend it properly and it will not leave white cast at all. i would definitely recommend this.",positive
"cute, but it is expensive for what it is. you have to use a lot of product, it is sticky, and it never really dries so it transfers on everything and streaks really bad no matter how much you moisturize. i bought this forever ago and have only used it a couple times and washed it off most of those times.",neutral
this work but for the price its not worth it. there are tons of brands out the that make acne patches for way cheaper and they are much more effective.,neutral
"why does my skin feel so...nice? is what i kept asking myself every morning recently. this cream is why. when i hear rich i normally think heavy and strongly scented. however, this is not that. the texture is thicker and yet not heavy on skin. it sinks quickly into skin and surprisingly does not feel oily. no strong perfume fragrance.once i put this on my skin just feels so soft and smooth. in fact, i have been going without makeup primer recently and my makeup still looks great.so, i guess this could in essence replace my primer too, which is a bonus because, whew, the price is enough to make you faint.",positive
"this was not work plus shipping, disappointing.",negative
i have waited for a while to see the result of using ordinary products before writing my reviews. hyaluronic acid b was ok on my face even i felt dryness after using this product and need to use moisture immediately. i may buy again this product.,neutral
love how little you need to really lather your whole face. smells so good and i have super sensitive skin with no reaction at all. love it!,positive
"the texture of this is extremely sticky and thick, but not in a rich creamy moisturizing way. it feels like applying corn syrup to the face, and i do not see how this could work for any skin type",negative
"i bought this after reading all the raveeeee reviews on every website that sells it. i broke out in one of the worst breakouts i have had in years after using this for a week. call it a purge, call it adjusting, it is horrible. i think if you are worried only about aging skin texturepores this could be great. acne sufferers beware.",neutral
works so well! i can already see a difference in my skin after just a week of daily use. the texture of my skin has gotten so much better- i usually get small bumps on my forehead and jawline but they are mostly gone now. i also feel the redness in my face has reduced. i only need a small amount to cover my whole face. will definitely repurchase when the time comes.,positive
"i have combination skin and sensitive skin. when using this product i never had any issues with it. it left my skin feeling fresh and hydrated.it does not really have a scent to it, which it would have been nice if it had a soft scent of coconut or a fresh scent. but overall i really liked this product!",positive
"here is the deal this is a good product. i do recommend people try this if they are looking for a cream for sensitivedamaged skin. this used to be great for my skin when it was stressed and dry, and it was my go to moisturizer to use with retinol, but out of nowhere it started to pill no matter where i used it or what i used it with. i would go to sleep with it on and when i would wake up, it looked like my pillow was covered in dead skin flakes from how much it pilled during the night. it is such a bummer because i really did love it.",negative
"i have been using this product for around three weeks, and i can assure you it did absolutely nothing for me. i almost felt like it made my face more oily. at first i really could not stand the scent and i am never one to complain about them it smells a lot like cactus and plants and only faintly like watermelon. as the time passed, thankfully the scent got better. as dire the reducing pores it is absolutely false. no improvement and i know it is not supposed to shrink them but i expected the product to at least gently deep cleanse inside with the pha which would help the pores looking small because they are clean. it does feel kind of nice but often it just feels a little greasy even if i make sure to use it on damp skin. really not recommend.",negative
i have been obsessed with eye creams since i was in my late teens. this was my go to eye cream and i am literally obsessed but since i now live in the philippines finding an alternative has become a mission. would highly recommend- a great product that your eyes will thank you for.,positive
this creme de la mer is not for my combination skin. i had not had acne for almost two years. but it caused me acne and made my skin look super oily. not sure why everyone is raving about this cream. had high hopes but feeling disappointed now!,negative
i can see this working for light makeup days or for light makeup users but for me personally i have to use double the amount i use with a normal cleansing balm and even then sometimes my brows are still not removed. i also would not call this a balm the consistency is more of a cream than a balm. it is not a terrible product but i believe it should be marketed as a cream cleanser meant for dry skin and not a makeup removing balm.,negative
"i do like this product for the price. it does remove all my make up. but i definitely have tried cleansing balms that i like more. but you really cannot beat this price. it is still a yes in my books since it does exactly what it states and is cheap, i have just tried better but more expensive.",neutral
i was able to try this product free through influenster!i loved the scent of this toner. i also liked the way it feels on the skin! to be honest though i did not see any difference in my pores. i also make sure i did not combine it with other products so i can see the full results. if you are looking for something that just smells delicious than this may be for you,neutral
"i like the consistency, feels nice going on. however, tingles after being applied and does not help with oil production. it made me so oily during the day and caused me to breakout. i do not recommend if you have sensitive skin. i am thinking the pineapple enzyme was the culprit.",negative
this product was amazing with my skin it protected my face so good. the consistency is excellent for oily skin. and the aroma is not overwhelming. i recommend this product very much.,positive
"this lotion has been a godsend for my super dry skin. i have been using it as a serum step under moisturizer but it definitely has the power to work as a moisturizer alone. the texture is a mildly thick cream but it absorbs so quickly into the skin so i never have problems with pilling. my favorite thing is that it contains ceramides so my skin barrier is actually repairing long term, not just making my skin feel better when it is on. i have definitely noticed a huge improvement in the dry spots on my face. i am glad it is unscented and gentle because i can use it around my eyes which are generally the dryest spot on my face.",positive
"to echo what everyone else is saying, this product feels like straight up cooking oil. i got it on a whim, used it twice, and relegated it to my bottom-tier body sunscreen collection. fast forward two months, and my dermatologist put me on tretinoin. suddenly the lower half of my face was flaking off semi-constantly, and i figured i would give this guy another shot. it somehow managed to be even more disappointing the second time. what is really impressive about this product is its ability to turn even the driest, flakiest, most dehydrated skin into something closely resembling what i assume the deepwater horizon oil spill looked like. unless you enjoy asking yourself am i crying because i spent on crappy sunscreen? or is it just because that crappy sunscreen is currently burning my corneas off? i highly encourage you to buy something else.",negative
used every night and did not notice a difference. do not think it is worth the price point.,neutral
this serum is wonderful. my dark circles have diminished significantly. i use it twice a day and it absorbs into my skin nicely- it does not feel stickytacky afterwards like some other eye products i have tried. i received this complimentary from influenster and kiehls.,positive
glowy! they really named this product well. this sunscreen is so shimmery and glowy. perfect for summer! it is a bit thick and chunky if you do not agitate the bottle before applying but it goes on very smooth. i have gotten tons of compliments on my skin when i am wearing just the sunscreen and nothing else! it is not too thick and does not irritate my skin or make me break out like other sunscreens. love it!,positive
"i love tatcha products. this is amazing, i use it at night time. make sure to wear sunscreen during the day. my skin is smoother and brighter. it is worth the money.",positive
i have used the herbivore eye cream for weeks and really enjoyed it. the eye cream is silky and creamy. my undereye area feels immediately hydrated after using it. it is very gentle. i love an eye cream with retinol alternatives without causing any irritation. the cute purple color is a plus. the price is fair for an eye cream that contains peptides and bakuchiol. i was gifted by herbivore for testing.,positive
"i have been using this product for good three weeks now and did not notice any improvement in brightening or promoting hydration of the skin. i use it daily in to morning before applying my moisturizer and sun protection. the texture is oily, but absorbs pretty quickly and it has not caused any irritation so far. i will continue using it to see more improvements.",neutral
"just tried it out and loved it. loved the feel on skin, the hydration, the light scent. perfect to use as a night time cream for me!",positive
was very disappointed in this product. i do not know what i was expecting-but this is not it. the cleanser was very stripping and it smells like a christmas spice cake.,neutral
"works for oil reduction, feels good on the skin. over time it is very drying, even my thick sleep mask was not enough to hydrate my skin. i had to return this. i do not recommend using more than once a day",neutral
"i needed a mini-size moisturizer for travel, so i figured i would try this. i am not sure what this product is supposed to look like, but when i opened it, it looked and felt like melted coconut oil. and this greasy substance leaked out into my travel toiletry bag since the lid on the mini container does not seal tightly.as far as the product itself, it did its job as a night moisturizer. but there was no joy in the experience.",negative
"love me some caudalie, especially this stuff! brought my skin back to life. i had super dry patches lots of dark spots- not anymore!",positive
"this packing is beautiful, heavy, and luxurious looking. however, the product itself is a waste of your money. the actual product is very lightweight and blends easily, but it does not smell great for a face product. it smells very similar to cinnamon but faintly. i used this for several weeks and did not notice any difference in my skin except for eye irritation after using this, and no i did not apply near my eye area. i also noticed that it leaves residue behind especially if you plan on applying makeup over this. this product is too expensive for what it is- save your money!",negative
love love love. i repurchase this every time i run out. sad they no longer have the oz version which lasted me almost months. my favorite part about this wash is that my skin literally squeaks after i use it-- a feeling i have not gotten with any other face wash and that i am now addicted to.,positive
i purchased this after running out of a different product. it is sticky and tacky. i can see a difference in my skin. i will go back to the previous product.,negative
"works all day in the heat! it is light and stays all day. never got a sunburned face, never broke out, and works well alone or under make up.",positive
"this stuff is amazing!! works great. i love everything i have tried from this line. it literally takes off the top layer of dead skin and makes your skin look soft, clear, supple and plump!",positive
"i will not be purchasing this product again, nor would i recommend a friend to buy it. it is fine- it is not terrible, it is not great. i have used many other facial oils in the past that offered way more. sure, it is moisturizing, but it does not soak into my skin fast enough to be able to use this in the morning before i apply make up. all in all, i do not hate it... i will not return it and i will finish the bottle, but will not be adding this to my permanent list of go-to products.",neutral
"it is a nice face mask, it is easy to apply and wash off. it feels nice on the skin. but ultimately, i did not see any difference in my skin and for the price, i do not think it is worth it.",neutral
"pros great color, long lastingcons spent the past hour scrubbing off extremely patchy and streaky areasdo not use if you are going somewhere special the next day and give yourself a day or two to be able to fix areas that may end up looking like a mixture of peanut butter and fluff.",neutral
great product but horrible packaging. the purple coat on it flakes off and ends up on my face and hands.,neutral
"as someone who has been using oxy pads for years and a separate glycolic acid toner for, these are a godsend. they replace the multiple steps while achieving the same result.",positive
this moisturizer takes a lot of work to rub in--otherwise it leaves a white layer that does not absorb. it also made me break out everywhere! i have gotten whiteheads and big breakouts that usually do not occur. i would not recommend this product.,negative
"i gave myself three weeks to love it. i have oily skin, but it is also very dehydrated. i thought this would help. i started getting little milia bumps all over my face.i also really like the clean dewy look when heading to bed, it would only stay dewy for about minutes.i recommend the plump plump cream by glow recipe instead for the oily skinned gals that want night time hydration but also get clogged pores really easily.",neutral
"sadly, no difference in skin and barely tingled. tried x. have had better home peels.",negative
i am not really sure if i noticed any difference when using this product. what i can say is that mixing this with some foundation makes your face look so dewy and healthy.,neutral
i have very sensitive skin that is acne prone and this was a cheap enough mask compared to the glamglow mud mask. this did not make me breakout of because any irritation but i did not really see any improvement in my skin after using it. it was a nice mask to throw on when i needed to treat myself but i am sure there are more effective masks on the market.,neutral
i am happy with this inkey retinol cream. i am satisfied with the results. i would buy this. i like feeling like i am slowing down the wrinkles from forming.,positive
very disappointing and sorry i gave them as gifts. eye bags got noticeably plumper to the point that i needed to ice them before going out.. fell for the rose gold hype. waste of time and money.,negative
definitely worth a try if you have the money. great ingredients and it is fragrance free but i would not purchase it consistently. first aid beauty had a water cream that had a similar texture at a great price.,neutral
"i received this serum in my fall vox box from influenster and i have been using it morning and night for the past two months and i really love how it makes my face feel and look. i have used various serums before and this has been my favorite this far. the formula is thin and rubs in well, wleaving my face feeling fresh with a noticeable glow.",positive
"i originally got this as part of a set when i needed a cleanser. silly me, i casually gave the small trial container of peter thomas roths hyaluronic cream to my boyfriend because he needed new moisturizer. whyyy did i not keep for this myself?! i later stole a bit and ooooh does it feel amazing my boyfriend now insists on continuing to use this, because it does wonderful things for his ultra dry skin while allowing him to continue with a minimalist regime. my selfishness aside, i am completely, amazingly happy with the product and will keep a constant supply in the house for him. but i do not promise to not filch more from my boyfriend when he is not looking.",positive
"this is an ok product with some big flaws that will prevent me from purchasing it again and i am glad i went with the smaller size. it definitely cancels out any skin redness, and it certainly does its job as an spf. however, it is not even slightly water-resistant. a single bead of sweat will melt it all off your face, leaving you with a greasy look and beige streaks. it is basically a glorified tinted moisturizer since it does not seem to have any ingredients with a long-term benefit.",negative
"my new favorite night cream! a little dab of this on your skin then rub in and pat- no absorption issues like others claim. i use face serums and oils under this cream and everything absorbs just fine. others might be using too much of the cream i just use a little and works perfect. my redness does not appear no pimples or other issues. skin texture is nice no dry spots. skin even looks brighter. helps make some wrinkles less noticeable maybe continue use will help dull the wrinkles a little. also a major plus is this cream has a ton of good vitamins in it. there was a slight smell when i first opened the jar but i have zero notice of it now when i open the jar and do not notice a smell when i use it. not sure what others were complaining about. plays nice with herbivore oils underneath it, sunday riley serums underneath it and works nicely using sleeping masks ontop of it.",positive
"this was not very moisturizering for my dry skin, kept having to reapply. i do not like the gel either, just not for me",neutral
i have rosacea and dry skin but it also breaks out. i also struggle with needing some anti-aging help. i was skeptical but this cream is amazing! i use it in combination with my paulas choice oil boost and i wake up with dewy beautiful skin. it does not aggravate my rosacea at all. super happy to finally find something my skin can tolerate. i would just rather it in a pump versus jar for sanitary reasons.,positive
def hydrates and brightens i like how it feels but the fragrance is there and i had some bumps on my cheecks after travelling with it i gave it to my bf and bought another one so i will try again and see if it causes break outs,neutral
"giving this three stars because although it totally works and dramatically reduces my under eye bags, it does tend to leave a white residue if i am not strategic in how i apply it. also i really cannot use it with makeup or eye cream below or on top of it, because makes the white residue more visible, and also becomes less effective.",neutral
"lightly scented, lathers nicely. bottle leaks a lot. leaves a new soapy puddle on the counter every day.",neutral
"even after using them multiple nights on the same spot, these really did not make a difference for me. everyone is skin is different, so they may work better for others, but i was disappointed.",negative
"i received this product for testing and i did not know how this was going to help my skin. i have combination skin with congested pores and some breakouts. i used this after my cleansing night time routine and wow i was surprised. it is a pleasant tropical smell, the scrub is not abrasive to were it leaves my skin red or burning, and it helped so much around my chin and nose where my congested pores are the most. i have used it up to two times a week and my skin is feeling smoother and softer.",positive
"first off i want to say that i am obsessed with this packaging. it is sooo cute and looks great on the bathroom vanity i am a sucker for packaging lol i also love the smell, i usually do not like using self tanner because it usually leaves such a strong smell but this lotion smells amazing and i do not mind it at all. i love the result that it gives me. it leaves my skin looking so nice and evens out my skin tone.",positive
"starting earlier this year, i started to get hormonal acne- cystic pimplesweek and had high hopes for this given the stellar reviews. unfortunately, after a month of using this every night i still have not seen any improvement. i guess i am one of the few people that this just did not work for.",negative
found this to be too irritating for my skin because of the citrus oils.,negative
"the ingredients are promising, all are great vitamin c alternatives for reducing hyperpigmentation. i only use this one the pm on nights i do not use my retinol serum. i have not seen much results yet, but i will give it up to weeks to see if i get better results.",neutral
"as a primer, this product did apply nicely, and my foundation went on top perfectly. i have oily combo skin and i did not find it to be drying or mattifying. i do not feel like it helped my makeup last, i was still quite oily after a few hours. i have not used it long enough to speak to it as a treatment, but i did notice a little blurring.",neutral
this product is ok! i think this did make my skin softer but there really was not anything that special about this. i guess for this price point it is good but there are definitely better products out there that are similar to this.,neutral
i use this as a first step for double cleansing. takes off most makeup but does not work very well on waterproof mascara. when i use with a second cleanser there is not any residue on my skin leftover but i find it leaves my eyes very blurry after like it is stuck inside my eyes. it does say do not use around eye area though lol.,neutral
wow this stuff is garbage. i was putting it on for a few days and i really started noticing more lines on my forehead. scary.,negative
"it is honestly just okay. i hated the smell, which is a big factor for me. i did not notice it being any more effective or cleansing than the face wash i normally use.",negative
i have oily skin and congested pores and this mask literally cleared out the bumps on my forehead and blackheads on my nose it is my favorite fenty skincare product,positive
great affordable sunscreen minimal white cast on my skin and would definitely repurchase if i needed an affordable sunscreen,positive
"best facial rehydrating mist for extremely dry, reactive and sensitive skin. i have the worst eczema on my whole face. this helps cool it down before i apply my moisturizers and oils. morning, noon or night-- i cannot live without it or say enough about it. it is saved my skin.",positive
"i am very torn over this sunscreen. on one hand, i like the tint and how it is lightweight. on the other hand, it is kind of tight on my dry skin. my skin feels so uncomfortable at the end of the night, kind of the way your face feels after wearing a full face of makeup.",neutral
"i am very disappointed in this creme. i was very hopeful that it would help my dry and red skin, but it feels like a cheap drugstore moisturizer. the formula dries really greasy, so it reminds me of the early s claires foundation. would not buy again, probably will not even finish this tub.",negative
"i wanted to like this product, but it did the opposite of what it was supposed to do. my skin felt more tightdry once i started to use this moisturizer. i love the inkey list! but this product was not for me.",neutral
"i have awful cystic acne. i have spend years and tons of money finding products that work for me, especially because my cystic acne is combined with oily skin. i saw the serum on the sephora instagram pace and decided to give it a shot niacinamide, vitamin c and salicylic acid are all great cystic acne busters! and i fell in love! my acne started cleaning up within a week. about a month ago i started using it with the cleanser and then with the moisturizer when it came out. i also stopped using toner... and let me tell you... my skin is the clearest it is been in about- years. any breakouts i get are small and only slightly painful. my skin tone is more even. breakouts are only here for a day or less before they start shrinking! this line is in fact, the holy grail. i recommend it to everyone!",positive
"not such a good result unfortunately, there is no difference between my past skin and current skin conditions!",negative
"it makes me feel sticky little bit after use. if you use gel cream on top of the serum, it should be find. however, the serum makes me have more white head pimple under the skin. it is easier to treat dehydrated skin than white head pimple. this product is ok.",neutral
"this does brighten my undereye, i truly cannot deny that. i also love that it leaves my skin glittery, it is very cute! it is a good cream to use in the morning for the birghtening effect, if that is what you are looking for.the downside is that it is not moisturizing at all... so, for what it is worth, i will not be re-buying this cream and will be looking for a more hydrating one!",neutral
"i have dry, sensitive skin. i chose to use yo glow twice a week at night. right away, my skin felt smoother but not dry and tight. that is a good sign. after about a week and a half, i noticed my makeup applying better. i often get dry spots around my nose but my lightweight foundation looked cleaner and more natural. i am impressed. the only thing i did not like was the fragrance, like perfume.",positive
"this is a nice, high quality serum but the turmeric smell really turns me off. it is a relatively mild scent- kind of spiced like curry and earthy- but i dislike it enough that i would not buy the serum. if you do not mind the scent, i like the light texture and think it is a good product.",neutral
"this product is unbelievable, just after the first use i felt my skin was so smooth! this product is not heavy at all and does not even have a smell to it which makes you feel confident that you are not using harmful chemicals on your face like many other serums! and dries within second after massaging it into skin.",positive
"i really thought i was going to love this- i am absolutely obsessed with unseen sunscreen and i use vitamin c daily, but i did not. the product is very shiny when applied, and it never stops being shiny. i thought i could get used to that glow look but i broke out after just a couple days of using it. if your skin is not oily or prone to break outs, then give it a try! it is got everything you need for an easy morning routine. but otherwise, i would steer clear.",neutral
"just starting using this. it does seem to be very moisturizing a little goes a long way and it is a little on the greasy side. but, i have noticed my eyes are stinging after awhile. no direct skin irritation but it may be more of a coincidence. will keep trying it but not sure for how long",neutral
"i have seen so much hype around this product lately so i was so excited to try it but it was very disappointing. i applied it the correct way by patting it in but it did not look good. it made me look pale and sickly, and clings to every spot of dry skin. it also has a strong fragrance and irritated my skin. i am returning.",negative
"i am genuinely confused by the glowing reviews and sad that i cannot have the same awesome experience as everyone else! i have normal skin- if anything, on the dry side, but my skin is very low maintenance generally. i have tried this product now or times to keep giving it another shot, but it really does not work for me. i have been using it as an overnight mask, and when i wake up, my skin feels tight and not as moisturized as using my regular moisturizer. reading everyone elses reviews seriously make me feel like i must have a faulty product. i will say, my skin looks dewy in the morning, but that is just because of the excess product left on my face. my cheeks feel dry after using it. so disappointed!",neutral
"unfortunately, this did not work for me. using this for a few days and once i apply it, starts pilling like crazy! the rose scent is a bit too overwhelming for me. it honestly was not all that hydrating even though it claims to be. not a fan.",negative
"i liked the way it made my face feel after i applied it to my acne. it made any itching or pain go away, but it did not help the acne go away.",negative
"i really enjoy this cleanser. it does a good job of removing dirt and makeup, has a nice texture. i also like that it has a gentle foam without leaving my skin feeling stripped afterwards.",positive
i received this product complimentary from influenster for review purposes. this is such a great everyday moisturizer. it hydrates my skin but does not make me greasy after few hours. the texture is somewhere between a gel and a cream. it absorbs really quickly too. it does not feel heavy and did not make me break out. the cream has a faint citrus candy smell which i quite enjoy. it is expensive for sure but worth it.,positive
"not as hydrating as i expected- in fact, the area around my eyes feels pretty taut and dry after applying this.",neutral
smells so gross. immediately washed off. and then... started to breakout. i do not have sensitive skin at all. worst stuff i have ever tried on here.,negative
"nothing special, works just as any drugstore hyaluronic acid. the texture is very weird, feels like a jelly and takes a wile to sink into the skin.",negative
ok i know this has good reviews but i am glad i got the sample. i have been looking for a vitamin c serum and for some reason most of them are sticky on the face. yea i do not like that feeling. i mean if it left my feeling looking and feeling amazing i would disregard the stickiness but nope not this product. when i put it on it felt like water almost.,negative

"i am, with rough, dry skin prone to breakouts if i use any product with silicones in it. so my options for moisturizers are limited. i also use prescription strength retinol every other night which makes my skin drier. i was hoping this serum would give my skin some moisture. but no. used it alone and under my josie maran argan oil and could not tell a difference either way. not even a slight improvement. stars because it was not expensive.",negative
i received it for free in my influenster package. honestly does not do anything for my fines lines. it does give a bit of hydration but that is about it. i still like their banana eye cream and that is way better than this one.,negative
i am super duper oily textured skin but at have to address aging concerns as well. this lightly fragranced formula is pleasant not only to the eye but smells and feels great. as a first time user i can guarantee i will be re-purchasing as a daily moisturizerspf product for the fallwinter.,neutral
"this product is something that i do not reach for due to the floral fragrance, heavy consistency that does not dry fast yet does not have enough hydration. plus the jar packaging turns me off because it is not the most hygienic and gets under your nails!",negative
"i am and this sits in every wrinkle and pore, aging me more. i think it would be great for younger skin. just not for me. i am on the search for a daily moisturizer again.",neutral
"i was really excited to use this for product after reading the great reviews it had. i put mine in the fridge and it gave a great cooling effect, however they are so think and slippery and difficult to put on. i was able to put on the right one fine but the left one got folded up and it was almost impossible to get it back to its shape. the smell is pleasant and smells a little like coffee.",neutral
"if you have oilky skin, this product is a big no no. it leaves my skin oily, kind of feels like you are applying lip balm to your face. does not feel like a cleanser. the balm is so thick that it does not come out of the tube. they definitly need to rework the package. it pains me to say this because i love the inkey list, but this product is not good at all.",negative
i have been taking care of my skin religiously for the past months and have seen it improve dramatically. got a deluxe sample of luna and decided to implement it in my routine. applied it at nighttime and immediately the next morning i had about a dozen whiteheads on my chin which never happens and a nice big hard pimple on my forehead. i am so upset! all of my hard work and patience reversed in day. never again sr!,negative
very nice feeling on skin but does not go a long way at all,neutral
this would be alright to buy as a top-up to get free shipping but i did not feel this did anything more than my hyaluronic acid serum does already.,neutral
"i like that this lightweight serum absorbs quickly into the skin, hydrates, and does not leave any stickiness. however, after using it for some time, i am somewhat disappointed that i do not notice any difference in the look of my skin. i do not see that glow which the product advertises. i have normal to dry, sensitive skin and this serum was gentle and did not because any problems for my skin. the packaging is beautiful!",neutral
i was expecting to see a big change but unfortunately i have not seen much of a change at all.,neutral
"be aware that sephora has this listed as ozml but the product delivered to me was.ozml. aside from that, it seems to be a good moisturizer but i have not seen any significant benefit or change from my previous eye cream. not worth the price tag for the half ounce received.",neutral
i received this product complimentary from goop. i tried it and was not impressed. it is not anything i would purchase in the near future. thank you for the opportunity that was given for me to try this product.,neutral
"i gave it a try for the whole summer and liked it at first. but then the heat got to me and i feel like i made my makeup melt. realistically, only protected you for like minutes. it also made me break out.",neutral
"there is an ingredient called polyethylene in this which is plastic!!!!! it most likely is harming the environment and is not good for ocean wildlife! however, this does do the job, but there are many other makeup cleansing balms without this ingredient that i would feel better using.",negative
"i really, really wanted to like this, but it just is not for me. its more shimmery than it is glowy, and a bit too dark for me. worst of all, it brings out all my texture. i mean, it blocks the sun and i can put makeup over it, but seeing how bad my skin looked when i first put it on was surprising. also it pills like crazy.",negative
i did notice that this was helping in reducing the size of my pores but halfway through the bottle the formula hardened and it is very difficult to squeeze it through and comes out super dry. i cannot use the rest of the product now because of this.,negative
"i am kind of a natural hippie gal when it comes to what i put on my skin, but lately i have ventured into the less natural products out of curiosity and shame from dermatologists and skin care gurus haha but i have had bad reactions to everything that is been recommended to me. this is the first product i have tried that i have not had a bad reaction to, and not only that, i am very pleased with how my skin feels and looks. yes this moisturizes but i now understand what hydration means when it comes to skin care. this creme is incredibly hydrating! my skin feels soft, luminous, bouncy and hydrated! and roses from bulgaria are the best, they are actually considered a herb with many amazing properties. the only disappointment for me is that it smells more like cucumber and i cannot smell the rose, which makes me sad because rose is my favourite scent, but it still smells very clean fresh and light. if you do not like scent in your skincare this one is so light i do not think it would bother you.",positive
i got a sample packet of this and i was very excited to try it. however...it has a very strong floral fragrance that took several minutes to fade and triggered my allergies. i cannot wear this again.,negative
"this product is amazing! being a nurse, i have been having to wear a mask to work and it is been driving my skin crazy. i was having the dullest, uneven tone and texture and redness. weeks into using this daily and my skin is brighter and more even. i am able to wear less and less make up to work which my skin loves also and i am getting constant compliments!",positive
"you would either like it or you will not. though it is oil free, it makes your skin look dewy throughout the day. as much as i do not like that i do not mind it because it makes me pores look pretty small and my skin plump.",positive
"so i have very dry and sensitive skin and i have been looking for a moisturizer for my dry skin.let me tell you, this is ah-mazing! it quenches your skin and gives your skin life! the scent is so so good. the fact that it is for sensitive skin is a plus, because my skin is highly sensitive and it can get irritated so quickly but this really works! i use this in the am and pm, and it is my go to. i finally found a holy grail moisturizer!",positive
"my skin is dry, flakey, rough and this has been the only moisturizer to quench my face. you get so much product in the oz container it is so worth it. it is rich without being oily or heavy but if you have really oily skin might not be for you. give it try! you can always return it.",positive
such a great product! perfect primer and it gives a nice glow to your skin plus the sun protection. will definitely purchase again. oh it does pill if i rub it in too aggressively so i recommend patting it in.,positive
perfect night time serum with visible improvements.i wish it was a tad thicker but i love it,positive
"i have been trying to find the right nd cleanse to double cleanse with and the previous ones i was using left my skin so tight and dry, but this moisturizer is light but also hydrating. does not have much of a scent either",positive
this does everything it says it does! my skin is so much softer and glowing after i put it on and it smells delicious too! i definitely notice a difference in my skin.,positive
"i liked this cleanser enough to purchase again. it does not leave my skin overly dry and removes my makeup well. it is perfect for my combo, sometimes oily skin. i would not recommend it for drier skins. i really like the container because it allows me to get every last drop of product out without wasting it. it does not have much of a scent which is good but also does not smell so amazing that it makes me look forward to washing my face with it. it foams nicely. the price point is amazing for the size. i would definitely recommend trying it.",positive
"product was okay, i would use in a pinch but not going out of my way too reorder.",negative
"disappointing product. pills, waxy texture and is hard to smear which causes you to tug on your eyelid. it also burns my eyelids for some reason. gave two stars due to the ingredients but i would not recommend and will not repurchase.",negative
"there is nothing special about this product. i guess, of course, facial sprays in themselves do not actually even do much. the spray it is just refreshing for about seconds until it kind of wears off, and honestly i feel like it makes my skin feel dry and tight and sticky after it dries. affordable but would not recommend. there is no purpose to it and i feel like it makes my skin worse than if i had not sprayed it.",negative
i was excited to receive this cream complimentary. i really likedappreciated that it came with a spatula i do not like having to dip my fingers into my skincare. the packaging is prettylooks nice on vanity or shelf. i applied this cream as part of my evening skincare routine. i noticed that it was a thick cream so i only used a small amount and applied to my orbital eye area. the next morning i noticed that my undereyes and lids looked very greasyshiny. i did not like that-i already struggle with shinyoily lids. i did however notice my skin a bit more moisturized. i think this should be worn at night and not during daytime or with makeup.,neutral
i have been using this a few times a week for several months and it does not do anything. i am really only using it to finish it at this point because it is not helping or hurting.,neutral
this de-puffing jade facial roller is not that great. you can get the same facial rollers at any other store. i have yet to see any results and the quality feels pretty faux.,negative
i love this! it works just like it says it does for my skin! just purchased my second bottle!,positive
"maybe it is just the package i got but these pads were not very hydrated in solution. they felt really dry and my skin did not react to whatever solution was in there very well. my skin felt tight and dry and formed little bumps. sadly, i just did not get the results i was hoping for. but everyone is skin is different! maybe it is great for someone else.",neutral
"please, please stop putting parfum in skincare. otherwise the ingredient deck would be perfect. clean skin care brands should realize that fragrance in any form is harmful to the skin.",negative
"i received this product to try out from influenster. i was so excited as i am very much into skin care and want to use the best products on my face. unfortunately, this product was not right for my skin at all. when i woke up the next morning my face was dry and dull looking which is unsual after using my regular night cream. i tried it again the following night and the next day i woke up i had fine bumps all over my face! i was appalled because of all the rave reviews about it and the expensive price. i will not be using this again.",negative
"been using this for year, my skin has become so dry that it flakes off. i cannot even wear make up anymore because of how much texture i have. and yes i exfoliate. it just dries out my skin like crazy.",negative
horrible product! does not work! left a white cast all over face. did no magic work no firming toning. nothing! waste of money!!!,negative
"most of these reviews are incentivized, but i can honestly say this serum is not worth the price tag at all. it is nice and moisturizing with the hyaluronic acid plumping the skin, however, the moisture does not last. i have tried different serums that are significantly cheaper and i saw better results than using this product. good molecule has really great peptide and ha serums. do not waste your money on overpriced products.",negative
made my skin dryer somehow. disappointed given all of the great reviews. glad i got the small. oz version so i did not waste too much money.,negative
"do not get me wrong, i love this stuff, but i really wish they still had the oz squeeze bottle. why did they get rid of it??",neutral
i got this in my allure box and it is pretty rad. the smell is a bit strong but it feels great on my skin.,neutral
okay product. a little runny. cannot tell it is doing anything but it is not hurting anything either. i probably would not buy again.,neutral
this stuff is magic. it makes my skin so soft and hydrated. i have rebought it probably three times at this point.,positive
i have very fair dry skin and i love this stuff! no patchy dry spots and i only added a couple drops to my face moisturizer at night for two nights and i have a nice golden glow now,positive
"my skin loves salicylic acid and, in turn, loves this product. reasonable price with a simpleminimally irritating formula.",positive
this products name is deceiving. i grabbed at the check out counter thinking it was a face mist did not realize it is for setting makeup.,negative
i mean it did help with dark spots but made my acne so much worse. it is very fragranced and i would not recommend using it on your face.,neutral
"this was my first opportunity to try a product from this line, so i cannot compare the old formulation. i have dark circles and deep set eyes, so i am always looking to brighten things up there. i have combination skin and my eye area can get oily, so any eye creams need to be moisturizing but not heavy.there are a few things i liked about this moisturizer. it is a light beige-yellow from ingredients like the gold and is designed to be more of a clean product. i like that it is fragrance-free and more natural. you only need a bit, so a little goes a long way, so the price includes a lot of applications. it is very hydrating even with just a light application. things do look a bit brighter post-application and it is good morning or night, depending when you need it. there is mica in it, so that may be principal or at least aids in the effect. i do not have anything i disliked in particular. i think it is a solid moisturizer, very hydrating, does offer a little brightness. my concealer is still my best friend for my undereye, but things are hydrated and the cream is not too rich for my combination-oily skin.",neutral
"i was absolutely in love with this product until i started breaking out. i went back and looked at the ingredients, and it contains shea butter. that is a no no for my ultra sensitive skin. i love the honeymoon glow, and wanted to love this as it is nicely moisturizing, but i just cannot.....i do not need acne at years old.",neutral
i do not love it. the glow recipe watermelon toner is so much better. this kind of stings when i use it.,negative
"loved the feeling and experience of using this mask, but if you are using any retinol products, please be aware that it may cause a reaction. i use retin-a and this mask, while initially leaving my face super soft, caused a large peeling scab on my face.",neutral
"i am absolutely stunned by this! i love how soft my skin is after using this!! super smooth, feels like a baby skin!! my face has been cleared of zits! makes my skin glowy and healthy looking! one of my favorite steps in my skin care routine!! must try!!",positive
i have acne prone skin but at the time that i bought this my skin was completely clear and slightly dry. the first week that i used this my face felt amazing but on week two my face broke out so badly that i had to go to a dermatologist who advised to never use it again.,negative
i love the consistency of this cream but a bit disappointed when i open and it is not full.,neutral
"my face was full of pimples and blackheads, i do not suffer from acne and this product caused me pimples every day, it is expensive and poor quality.",negative
love it! bought this after reading some reviews stating it helped with their dark circles and puffy eyes. due to genetics i have always had puffy eyes and dark circles so i bought this hoping it would help and it did! i also read some reviews saying it left a stickytacky feeling and felt like it did not soak into their skin but for me i did not experience that at all. i do not feel any sort of tacky or stickiness when i apply this product.,positive
i have used this toner twice and i have absolutely no acne but somehow i got two whiteheads under my lip after using this. also the toner foams which is weird to me. i have never had a toner that foams as i apply it to my face with a cotton ball. i find drug store toners to be better than big brands ie. biore pixis glow tonic are better and both my go toos. also the price is better.,negative
"dried my face out, made me breakout like crazy and the actual soap bar is too small and ineffective for the price. i will not repurchase.",negative
"i received this product free in exchange for my review, but i am not sure how i was chosen due to having more oily skin than dry. because of this, this product did not work perfectly for me. i am hopeful that during the winter time, it will work better with my skin. this skin drink feels very luxurious and the packaging is beautiful. it has a natural grape scent to it not that artificial purple stuff, which can come off a little strong if that is not your favorite. for oilier skin, i would recommend only using at night to seal in all your skincare products. using in the morning and with makeup just leaves you very slick and greasy by the end of the day. if you are going for a very natural look with no foundation, this has your skin looking very dewy and moisturized. keep in mind it is very fluid, so it will drip down your face quickly- either use in your hands and apply to your face, or drop in one area and apply right away. would recommend for those with dry skin!",neutral
i wanted to love this product but it just is not for me. it is terrible under makeup... i mean terrible. i would give it more of a chance if i used it at night but i have other products i use then. if you are someone who does not need to wear makeup then maybe this would work for you! it seems to just sit on top of the skin and not penetrate the top layer. need to wear,neutral
i was not a fan and not necessarily because of the smell but the amount of hydration it provides. i have combo skin with dull skin in the winter so my face is not like super dry. i anticipated better results from a moisturizer. my cerave cream gives me more moisture. i will go back to my fresh youth preserve moisturizer which is amazing!!! you will wake up glowing and still hydrated. with this one my face is not dry when i wake up but it is not glowing. it is not worth it.,negative
"i just finished using the entire bottle. this had no impact on my skin whatsoever. no impact on the appearances of pores, shine, black heads, any pimples i had, etc. it just had no effect. i have bought toner under from walmart that has worked better. i am disappointed i did not have the same experience as most of the reviewers here. i would not recommend.",negative
"did not see any result. it is a good moisturizer, but did not do anything to my sun spots",neutral
"works, but i had to use it in moderation. the first weeks i definitely noticed a difference in brightness. i had two bad scars from nose piercings the oldest scar cleared up a lot faster than the newer one. however after seeing how quickly it started to clear my scarring up i began to apply it all over my face and broke out. it is better to apply only on certain scars vs the entire face. not sure if i will purchase again but it definitely does work, it will also break you out.",neutral
i love this serum!!! my under eye bags are deceased!!! i look!!!,positive
"this is some amazing stuff! i have super-sensitive skin and this is one of the few lotions that do not irritate my face, and in fact heal and protect it. i love that you can use it elsewhere, too, and it is just as moisturizing and healing on elbows, etc. the smaller sizes are perfect for keeping at your desk as a hand cream, too. really love this and will continue to repurchase.",positive
"i purchased this mask from sephora in hopes that it would help with the pores on my nose, cheeks, and chin. i love the sensation when i put on the mask and using the cold water to rise it off, but otherwise, i do not notice any real changes in my pores. to me, the product seems a little gimmicky and not necessarily worth the near price tag. i have had better luck with freeman pore masks.",neutral
"the fragrance in this is nauseating. i tried it once and had to wash it off within mins due to the strong scent and it did not feel nice on my skin. if you have any issue with fragrance, do not purchase. i will be returning immediately.",negative
love this product! i use it every night as my night face wash.,positive
"i was so excited to receive a free sample of this from influenster and charlotte tilbury since i love her brand and never let myself splurge on it and was grateful to be selected to give my honest opinion. the very first thing i noticed was the very strong scent, which made me very nervous because i know my skin reacts to overly perfumed products. it took me a few uses to place what the scent is and finally realized it is very strong but pleasant rose botanical scent that i actually like it but am sure it would bother anyone who does not like roses or scented facial products. it has a very watery texture and i put a couple splashed in my hand then rub onto my clean face at night. it instantly makes your skin feel velvety- not necessarily moisturized but definitely a nice luxurious texture. i did try it in the morning prior to putting on makeup but did not like the way it reacted with my foundation so mostly used it at night. the issue i had with the toner is that it caused my skin to break out, both in the little red dots i get from irritation and several random blemishes that i almost never get. i took several days off from using it and tried it again and yup got another blemish almost instantly. i was so disappointed because i really wanted to love this and be able to use it daily but it is not worth the skin reaction for me. i do have sensitive skin and am betting it reacted to the fragrance but i cannot be sure. i am sure it would work great for anyone who does not have sensitive blemish prone skin and they would enjoy the way it leaves your face feeling soft and pampered but unfortunately it is not for me.",neutral
i love it but they need to make it bigger because this literally fits my hand and it cost.,negative
this left my face feeling super greasy. did not remove my makeup in the least and took forever to get it off.,negative
i never write reviews but this product is a life saver! i had a cystic breakout and i put the patch on and omg did it help. i can just imagine how it would work for smaller breakouts. if you are thinking about buying this product just get it and you will be so happy with the results.,positive
"good while it lasts, but considering the shelf life it is not worth it. turned orange less than months after purchasing.",negative
"love the ordinary! this is a pretty strong acid, so maybe not for beginners. i use it about once a week in the evening after cleansing.",positive
i absolutely love this product! it totally helped my skin and now i am glowing. you have to have this!,positive
"this product worked fine at first, however one day the mask was itching a bit more than usual, which i did not think was a big deal. but it gave me a chemical burn, causing my entire face to be bright red. i also find now that after using this product several times my skin has become very sensitive to certain products. my advice do not use products with an aha percentage above.",negative
"made me break out, but it felt great under my eyes. very moisturizing and love the cooling effect, it is just a little too greasy for my whole face.",neutral
i have been using for a few months now and it has only really done what it is supposed to about times. for the most part it just makes pimples last longer than they would on their own and makes new ones pop up in the same area. will not buy again,negative
"this little bottle is worth every penny, ladies say no to your morning coffees if your only reason for not getting this gem is its to expensive... because it is worth it! absolute must for me each winter and fall or anytime my skin is dry...or even irritated, it is magic",positive
"i really wanted to love this product because i have heard such great things. it has a weird smell, but does make my skin dewy, but did not a thing for the adult acne i have been struggling with. will not be purchasing again.",negative
used this every night for the past two months and have noticed no change whatsoever in my under eyes. they still look exhausted.,negative
great eye cream. not irritating and not greasy. plumped up the eye area nicely and not scented. this was a sample from topbox freeproduct to sample and review. i liked this eye cream and would use it regularly.,positive
very thin and watery but also leaves a slightly sticky film. do not see much of a change.,negative
sent complimentary from goop- a facial in a tub! that is what i have to say about this! seriously- my skin has never look smoother and brighter ever before! i know the price tag is quite something but you have to use such a tiny little bit that this will last you ages!! i was gifted this from the brand but would def repurchase on my own!,positive
i am not sure that this product makes my skin less red. the scent is so strong. it smells like a cheap lotion. it irritates my nose.i found this product very drying. it is very thinrunny but does not absorb into the skin well. it is mildly sticky. the pump does a good job at dispensing a good amount.,neutral
"not happy about this purchase. i am a huge fan of youth to the people, but i was not happy to receive one product with no sanitary label and one product that was half empty. when i messaged sephora, they said it was supposed to come without a sanitary label? i love the brand, but when you pay this much for skin care, you expect it to be packaged correctly and filled properly. i will say it is a nice product, just overall a disappointing experience. probably will not be purchasing from this brand again for a while.",negative
i actually really like the product. i am generally very picky about my eye creams-- from their consistency to what type of packaging they are in. this gel-cream does not irritate my eyes at all. it is pretty cooling. i usually pair this with the ole henriksen banana bright eye cream at night so i get the caffeine and vitamin c. i am excited to try more of the fenty skin products.,positive
"this is not a great product. not only did it not work well, it is messy, it gets clumpy, and it is not enjoyable to use.",negative
made my face breakout horribly i thought because of the gel texture it would be best for my acne prone skin well it made it worse,negative
"i was really excited for this, but it fell flat. it is a watery gel-cream. the second you start to spread it out, it feels like you are spreading water around. i guess i was just hoping for something that felt a little more...substantial on the face?? i would say it is medium hydrating. it does leave the skin looking very shiny, almost oily rather than glass skin. overall, not impressed and will not buy again.",neutral
i am really enjoying this product. it goes on smoothly and soaks in well not much residue. skin feels supple and soft in the morning! i also apply to the occasional dry patch on my face if i need an extra boost!,positive
"received complementary a-gloei and have been using it for a while now. i honestly do not notice much of a difference. i personally just do not like my products to be overly oily and this one is. it is a great introductory retinol but i probably will not purchase, just because of personal preference",neutral
i have been using this cleanser for about- weeks and it is very soft and feels nice but does not remove makeup. if you want a regular cleanser that does not remove makeup this is good!,neutral
"it is a bit oily on the skin but i would not mind if that was the only downside. it is not that bad if you have normal to dry skin. it is so much less oily than the blue shiseido spf that looks and feels like actual oil. i like the consistency and smell. packaging looks pretty but hard to tell when you are getting close to the end and i cannot squeeze to get out every last drop.my biggest gripe is that it stings my eyes even if i do not apply to skin around my eyes, or if i apply a thinner layer, or let it sit, or do not use eye cream first. no matter what, my eyes water and sting and i end up having to remove most from that area with micellar water. that is why after my rd bottle i just cannot anymore.",neutral
"i like it. i do not have any problems with this product, skin-wise. no breakouts, or any other issues as far as i am aware since using it. i have rebought this product twice, but i am searching for something else that is more effective in terms of makeup removal.. i am not sure how well it cleans my make-up off, since sometimes i do find a bit is left over, even when i do a double-cleanse. i have seen many other reviewers say that cliniques take the day off balm is much better, so i will try that next. overall, i like this product. it is very cost-effective, does not bother my skin, and it can also be used as an oat-mask or something, when left on for min. i use it before my showers at night, so i can clean off all the sunscreen, make-up, sweat and debris. i highly recommend this product, regardless. i think it is very beginner friendly for those who are new to a double cleanse method, or even just looking for something that will not break the bank. i will continue to buy this product though. super happy, for sure.",positive
this product is an integral part of my skincare routine. it softens any fine lines and leaves my skin glowing.,positive
"initially the first day, i absolutely loved everything about this cream! the texture was beautiful, the packaging was beautiful and it seemed to moisturize my skin beautifully! i have combination skin, which is very oily with very dry patches. i wanted to try something that was extra moisturizing for my dry flaking skin. i am in my late s and this seemed to fit the bill, especially after i read such amazing reviews! i also loved the ingredients list. at first, this seemed like the perfect product...after four days of using this cream, my skin was peeling and flaking especially around the mouth! so sad. i do not know what ingredient in this cream was drying out my skin, but it made my combination skin into a hot mess! i had clogged pores, acne and chunks of dry skin all around my mouth. i have never seen my face so dry, ever! this face cream is too much money for a face cream that does not moisturize at all and makes your skin peel after a few days. sadly, i returned it!",negative
will not be buying it again as the bottle hardly has any product. also no matter the amount i use still feels i only have water on on my face.no visible change.,neutral
the packaging is nice and has a pump to dispense the product. no strong fragrance from the moisturizer. i did notice it was a bit drying on the skin after an hour of application. i have combination skin.,neutral
"this product honestly disappointed me. it left my skin feeling really dry, almost like if it sucked out all the mousture. also the pump is really inconvenient since the product kept leaking everywhere. do not recommend for dry skin.",neutral
"after days of use, my face was an oil slick and so many breakouts i normally have no breakouts. if you are looking for super moisture in the form of oil, this lotion will do that. i am going to blame the mineral oil for the pimples, and the oily skin. upon reading the ingredients, there is really nothing listed that is beneficial to your skin. many other moisturizers out there that can give you ingredients that are good for your skin.",negative
"i really love this product. it does not have the strong watermelon scent that the moisturizer has, but more of a cactus-y scent like we have in arizona, so i do not mind it too much. the main things is that it has really made a huge difference in my skins hydration. it leaves my skin plump and glowing and has helped improve my skins texture. i highly recommend this product to anyone with oily combination skin. it does not dry out the dry parts of my skin and helps control the shine of my t-zone.",positive
great product. i received as a sample and i did not expect much but wow. been using this for- weeks and i noticed improvement in skin with some dark spots getting lighter. if your curious of this product i would definitely say to try it.,neutral
"if you are an experienced acid user, i am not sure you will find anything revolutionary about this product except the price. however, for people who have less experience with chemical exfoliation, this would be mindblowing. and regardless of whether or not you have exfoliated with acids before, this price point is literally unbeatable. it performs as well, if not better, than many other similar masks from other brands that are at least x more expensive. that being said, this mask is no frills- you are getting pure acid exfoliation with nothing else to really soften the blow. the experience of wearing this mask can take some adjusting- it tinglesitches slightly more than other hardcore peel masks i have used. to help with that, i usually follow this up with a hydratingcooling mask afterward ptr cucumber works great for this!. i do this combination approximately every two weeks and my skin is visibly more even, brighter and insanely smooth for days after. overall, this is a great addition to anyones skincare arsenal!",positive
"this serum dries my face and does not allow my skin to absorb moisturizer properly. it made my acne worse, and nor did it minimise my pores.",negative
"i bought this because someone recommended it to me they said it worked well with them,from the reviews i read on here and another site many said that it works right away and it makes you go to the bathroom well i have not and in fact i think it made me constipated.my husband is constipated also and actually felt dizzy after taking it the third time.i am not sure if i should continue to see if i will see results but so far i am not impressed.and also this says these products are vegan but looking up the ingredients it contains milk,i do not mind but for those who do follow a vegan diet should know the truth.",neutral
does this make my dark circles disappear? no. there is some brightness because it is shimmery no glitter. i like it only because it feels cooling and i enjoy putting it on in the morning. it has caffeine too. i think i just enjoy the feeling of the cooling more than anything. i do not have puffy under eyes but i think that would help people with such a problem as well.,neutral
"cleansed full glam makeup and waterproof mascara as well as my origins cleansing oil. does not lather, which is fine, and no fragrance. did not dry out my face. will definitely use it all and may purchase again if it continues to perform like the first couple of days i have been using it.",positive
i am almost and never really took care of my skin. i just started a routine about a month ago using all the ordinary products that was recommended by a deciem consultant. i am loving everything except the caffeine eye serum. i find it does nothing to help puffiness or dark circles and it makes under my eyes annoyingly sticky. this vitamin c serum is really nice and has a very subtle citrus scent. my skin has definitely improved over the last month and i am looking forward to more improvement as i continue to use this product. i was told it can take up to months to see results. i look forward to my am pm routines! it is about time i invested in my own self-care.,positive
"when i first put this on, my skin looked moisturized. i checked my makeup minutes later, my skin was dry again and cracking",negative
i do not know how to feel about this. it dosent apply very evenly among your skin.,neutral
it is never enough. perfectly matches with morning night time routine.,positive
"i love this cream! i have combination skin and it is the perfect amount of moisture for my oily t zone and my drier cheeks! it does not clog my pores either, which tends to happen when i change moisturizers. i switched from the tatcha water cream to this and not only is it more affordable, it works better. i am excited to see how it works in the drier cold months but so far, i am in love!",positive
"i read the reviews before using this and was a tad worried that this would break me out, like so many others. i do not have acne but my skin is very sensitive and will break out very easily with products. i used this twice, only on my forehead wrinkles, testing it in one area before i used it anywhere else. and sure enough, i broke out in tiny bumps all over my forehead. do not recommend if you have sensitive acne prone skin.",negative
i really enjoyed using this. unlike other acids my skin feels radiant after use. does not feel harsh but works well.,positive
"i really love everything by drunk elephant and own almost the entire line and use it exclusively, but this was the only product by them that i did not like. it leaves a slimy feeling film on my face after using it, and i ended up just using it as body soap which it is way too expensive for and i do not really like it for that either.",negative
i am giving this stars because it definitely hydrated my skin. but aside from that i unfortunately fell under the category of also breaking out from using this. i know it was the jet lag mask because that is all i have changed in my routine and once i removed it my skin cleared again. i so badly wanted to love this there is so many great reviews!!!! i think a lot of beauty gurus say it is amazing because they want to support another guru. just my opinion,negative
"feels like it just sits on my skin. it does actually work and is somewhat moisturizing but feels heavy and sticky for hours after applying. i would say it is similar to f.a.bs most popular moisturizer so if you like that one you may like this. my favorites are peter thomas roth water drench, skinfix barrier, and murad nutrient-charged water gel. so if you also like those, this biossance moisturizer may not be for you.",neutral
"i have very dry skin, which means my eye area is always dry as well and i have had wrinkles since i was in college. i need very moisturizing eye cream and this product is not enough for me. it is very light weight and my eyes are always dry next morning when i wake up. definitely not anti-aging for dry skin.",neutral
"thick consistency for the night time application. i do not see drastic changes months of use, but it moisturizes my eyes. had better products. very difficult to get out, always have to use a little spoon that the jar comes with. not the best design i guess.",neutral
i am a big fan of the ordinary but i did not like this product. my skin felt greasy and broke out.,negative

"okay so, my skin sucks. i have very acne prone skin that will look great one day and the next... well, you know. no joke, if i lay on my boyfriends chest and do not wash my face after, i will wake up with a pimple. anyways, i have used niacinamide in the past as its wonderful for so many skin issues acne, wrinkles, dullness, pih but this product is seriously one of the best i have bought for my unpredictable, freaky, rude skin. after about weeks of consistent use morning and night my skin looks the best it is ever looked. highly recommend!",positive
"i have tried dozens upon dozens of eye creams, and this kiehls eye treatment is hands-down one of the best! it instantly brightens my under eyes and when used at night, my skin still feels very moisturized the next morning. however, for me it also caused milia on my under eyes after consistent use. and i do not usually have sensitive skin. whenever i stop using this eye cream, the milia clears. i kept coming back to this product because it works so well, but would always end up ditching it- weeks later when the milia returned. eventually, i gave up on using it entirely.definitely recommend, it is a solid eye cream and worth a try! everyone is skin is different, and this formula might not because issues for others like it did for me.",neutral
"i will never stop using this moisturizer. extremely hydrating, gel like texture, that absorbs into the skin quickly. i love that it does not feel sticky or tacky when applied. gives the skin a nice smooth finish, so i rarely ever use a makeup primer. i have dry sensitive skin and have never had a negative reaction. this is my go to moisturizer during the winter months.",positive
"overally i am not unhappy with this product. very clean ingredient list. i gave it a week to try, i started getting uneven txtire on my forehead and around my eyes.",neutral
"i really did not see a difference in this on my acne prone skin. was nott worse or better. it smells and feels like heaven, but that was not enough to make me keep it. there was also a crack in the glass upon arrival and some mild leakage.",negative
"after a few nights of using this cleanser, i am really pleased by how nourishing the product is. and while i am often skeptical about whether you get substantial results from ingredients like soy and aloe in a wash-off form especially, this product offers a sufficiently thorough, gentle cleanse that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. i like this cleanser--quite a lot, in fact. but nearly for ml is easily more than double its worth. and i think fresh has attempted to justify this products high price point by advertising the cleanser as this-in- cleansing makeup remover with toning effects. it is a cleanser, and a really lovely one. but be wary of this makeup removing face wash advertising it is not as effective a makeup remover as a balm, cream, or oil, and so i find this product best used as the second part of a two-step cleansing routine. and as for its effects as a toner--i would assume that the products inclusion of rose and cucumber is for the sake of its divisive fragrance more any reliable outcomes in balanced skin. if this product were, then we would be talking but i will not be spending on a cleanser when i can find excellent alternatives for less than.",neutral
"i really wanted to like this product as i mostly like everything from ordinary. as a lot of reviews have already mentioned this, it has a weird texture and does not really gel up well in the skin. i stopped using this after four uses my skin got a little spotty here and there",negative
"i find it a little to harsh for my skin. even though i have combooily skin i prefer more gentle cleanser that will not strip your natural oils. after using this one my skin feels clean, but too squawky clean, feels too tight. would not repurchase it",neutral
"once it is on, it does not really look glowy, just oily. it also does not soak into the skin very well and makes my face feel oily for the entire day.",negative
"it does not come out of the bottle no matter how hard you squeeze, even took the cap off and still nothing. cannot believe it is so hyped.",negative
"love this!! my skin gets very oily in the summer time so this oil is truly for all skin types as it says. it gives my face a nice clean glow, also it does not weigh heavy on my skin. its a very light weight oil",positive
after reading good reviews i wanted to try this serum out. unfortunately this did nothing for my skin. after using it for months i have not noticed any chance. disappointed about wasting money on de. will not repurchase.,negative
this is really great stuff- understand it is not a quick fix though. it takes time to work- like most things do. i have a very fair complexion and when i get a breakout it leaves a red scar in its place. i have been using this for about a year- i usually only use it at night as the last step in my skincare routine. it does make your face peel slightly- it is a resurfacing treatment. i have found it about- weeks of use i see the acne marks fade. this also helps with current acne breakouts and blackheads i feel like. i will continue to use but i am deducting one star because of the pricequantity. it is expensive for the amount of product you get- but it works.,positive
"smells good, goes on nicely, but saw no difference. i even re-purchased just to try it for a longer period of time, but gave up.",negative
sorry but i did not see what all the fuss is about with this product. really wanted to love it. definitely not moisturizing for my dry skin.,negative
i absolutely love this! i use this as a spot treatment for areas that i have larger pores and have noticed a huge difference.,positive
"i have been using this product for over a month now, and there is no progress. this is after using it every day and always reapplying sunscreen. do not see myself recommending this to anyone.",negative
"i love the idea of a tinted sunscreen serum. the products ingredients are also amazing. while this did provide an even skin tone, the results were short-lived due to pilling. i believe the serum has the potential to be great product, the formula just needs a little tweaking. i did not notice much of a difference after weeks of use, likely because the product does not absorb properly into the skin. as an overall suggestion, i would not recommend this product. the formula should be improved to provide better results.",negative
"i have been searching for a new gel moisturizer since sunday riley tidal is out of stock everywhere, so i decided to give this a try. i was pleasantly surprised. it sinks right in, makes your skin feel moisturized and leaves you glowy. and i feel like a little goes a long way. a on the pretty packaging as well. would purchase again.",positive
broke me out so bad! i used it and got huge bumps all over my face. super sad because i was really looking forward to this since i heard so many great thing.,negative
"i got this product after hearing so many great reviews. i definitely noticed that after one use my skin had a healthy, bright glow, even other people were commenting on it. there is only a slight tingling sensation, does not feel too harsh. however, after that initial use my skin felt a lot more sensitive and i got tiny red bumps on my cheeks. i waited about a week before using the product again and again i got more red bumps and my skin overall felt a lot more irritated. so overall, promising product that delivers glow but try a patch test first to see how your skin reacts.",neutral
for less than this eye cream does more than some of my more expensive eye creams. it is super lightweight and i use it in the morning to help my undereyes depuff. i keep it in the fridge so it is cold in the morning but it is a great first step. highly recommend it! no stinging if i get overexcited and put too much on as well,positive
"i like this moisturizer. it soaks in quickly and does not dry tacky, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. the scent leaves something to be desired, it smells like pickles, but it does not bother me much. it is pricey, and i am sure there are better moisturizers for the price but overall i do not regret the purchase.",positive
"this may work for some, but not for me. i have aging, dry, sensitive skin. excited to try this especially with all the rave reviews. after washing my face in the evening, i applied this moisturizer. it felt thick, which was what i was looking for, and after applying had a weird smell and just sat on my skin. it never soaked in, weird. i woke up to very dry skin, emphasis on dry. this happened over several tries so this moisturizer is just not it. the smell was kind of like a burnt oil smell, offputting. i am disappointed to say the least, really wanted this to work, especially for the price point.",negative
"burnt my face. now my skin hurts, is overdry and anything i put on my face burns. not for sensitive skin. i do not know why some of these reviews where talking about using this in their hair. i seriously need to stop trying these samples of stuff.",negative
"i really liked to using this moisturizer, the texture is thick and rich but it smooth out nicely spread to my skin. after i used this product, my skin looks like fully glowing and healthy looking. i received this product complimentary to test from influenster. i really enjoyed to using it every day!",positive
this is my st review ever and is going to be a bad one unfortunately. when i first opened the bottle it smelled horrible but since it is natural i thought it is normal. the texture is nothing like what i see online and it has brown spots and a film of oil on top. that is when i realized the product might is defective and i immediately returned it.,negative
i love this oil! was recommended by a friend for my dry skin and it has solved the problem. no more dry patches on my face. i use it morning and night after my moisturizer. does not clog pores or because any breakouts. would recommend!,positive
it feels nice after applying it but i do not think it is worth the hype. i do not feel it did anything to my skin.,neutral
this smells just like a super artificially-scented laundry detergent. i did not realize this in the store but yikes am i going to have to return this. i am not a scent-sensitive person per se but this is too much. it lathers up nicely but that is it,neutral
meh. this product is overhyped. i too feel more dry after using it.,negative
ok so i have been using this dry oil for a few weeks. i have been applying it twice a day. in the morning after washing my face and at night before bed. i do not think it is the greatest dry oil out there but it is one of the nicer ones i have tried so far. i have been using this with a combination of mario badescu drying lotion on my active acne and it has been helping however i do not know which product is doing the legwork. i still get acne every now and then and this product is supposed to stop pimples from coming up. the fact that i still am breaking out tells me that it is not working as well as it claims. i want to keep using it to see if it will take away scars too as that is a bigger issue for me. i am and have oily skin. i will keep using it to see if it is any good and if i actually see a difference. i however hate the smell. i cannot with the smell. i tolerate it but its too strong. overall the product is worth the try i guess.,neutral
first and foremost thank you influenster for sending this shiseido cream over for free to review. i am a huge fan of shiseido skincare i lpve their facial cleanser its a staple in my skincare routine. it was a bonus to receive this day cream but i was hesitant to use it with the flammable label that was listed. none the less i put my fears aside and tried it. this product left my skin feeling nice but the overall texture was too thick for my liking.,neutral
i will have to agree with everyone on the poor sprayer. it definitely spits and applies uneven. i ended up pouring the formula into a continuous sprayer i got on amazon and now i have no issues. it smells and feels a little minty which is refreshing for sure. and as others have pointed out-it is a little oily which is nice for a subtle dewy glow but if you are not into that i would not recommend this for ya. i like it overall-i like the added spf even though i do apply spf before makeup it is nice to know i am able to reapply with this spray.,neutral
"i received this product as a gift. i have only been using it for a few days i like the texture-it leaves your skin feeling soft as if you have used a primer. i cannot speak on it is effectiveness-you need- weeks to see results, but i am excited to use it am pm to see clearer skin. the packag is typical murad, though i found the pump does not always pump out product.",neutral
"my skin barrier is damaged and i was looking for some products to repair it. this mask looked like a nice choice, but when i applied it on my face, my skin started to hurt and got a little bit red. it was definitely not an allergic reaction. when i woke up in the morning i could see that my skin barrier got more damaged than it was. i do not know how this mask works on skin with heathy skin barrier, but i would not recommend to use it if your skin barrier is damaged. it has also salicylic acid on the ingredients list. so it is a big no for me.",negative
"i was really looking forward to trying this product, but unfortunately it was not great, especially for the price. the texture is ok- a cross between gel and lotion, and the scent is slightly lavender but not strong enough to consider it a soothing smell. i have been wearing it for two weeks now and have not found my fine lines to be less visible. also, when i use a generous amount like it says to on the bottle it leaves a thin film on my skin in the morning that makes my skin feel dirty, and a couple of times my skin has had a slight burning sensation. i gave it two stars because it is moisturizing, but i would never recommend it. i am surprised by the number of glowing reviews it has- i wish i was not so disappointed!",negative
"i do not really like it. it leaves my face feeling sticky it has made me get little bumps. i have tried using it less days, but then i do not get to tone. it does pick up a lot of junk from my pores. it just makes my face look ugly with bumps sticky.",negative
yep! this visibly improve the look and texture of my pores. love it!,positive
"not worth the price, this is not a good moisturizer. it is decently packed but it is not worth more than a drugstore moisturizer. did nothing for me. returned after weeks. used while using vitamin a.",negative
"this mask says it will do everything, like a miracle will happen. unfortunately i did not feel that my skin was any better, or moisturized, clear, anything... it just felt like a normal moisturizer, that is it. i could not justify paying so much for just slight hydrating effect, returned...!",negative
"i was using the previous version of the water bank cream which was a silky and luxurious moisturizer that provided perfect hydration without making my oily skin feel like an oil slick. i decided to try this new gel version thinking it would somehow work the same for my oily skin. what a disappointment. it really does not do much of anything, and certainly does not provide enough hydration. i just do not understand why brands change their formulations so often, because in most cases the newer formulas pale in comparison to the better performing older formulas.",negative
sooo nourishing. great for my dry acneic skin. best affordable cleansing balm,positive
"so i really wanted to love this... but it does nothing for me. i have normal to combo skin depending on the season. i can get oily and i can get dry at times. i do have pores and blackhead and my skin can flake. this has not changed any of that. for reference i am a medical esthetician and do a lot of research on products prior to making a purchase. unfortunately i did not notice even a slight difference. i would not recommend this product, as the only thing it offered me was a little tingle",negative
this moisturizer is mediocre. the reason for the low ratings is because there is so little product in the container that i only used it for a couple of weeks before it was gone. this is a sample sized amount inside of a decent sized package. i am very disappointed.,negative
"i am on this. pros the product has a nice texture and absorbs quickly. no perfume smell which is super important to me. cons i have sensitive skin. this product does because a slight tingle, and after repeated use i did notice some dry eczema patches on my skin. would be great for someone else, just not me.",neutral
"i tried a bottle of this product a few months ago and i fell in love! so i repurchased it and was super disappointed. the formula has changed dramatically, so it did not do much for my skin. i also think it broke me out. i did some research and it turns out that the team at sunday riley have been formulating tirelessly, to develop a treatment that works without bending the rules. so, instead of the original formula- lactic acid at with a ph of- the new eu formula swaps the lactic for glycolic another member of the alpha-hydroxy family, at the same concentration, with lactic acid salt at and a ph of.. unfortunately the new formula does not work with my skin!",negative
i tried to make this work for about and a half months. i was looking to get rid of some hyperpigmentation but my skin was mostly clear of acne. this was really awful to my skin. i think it is a bit too harsh and pore clogging. my skin was so incredibly dry and just hated me for using this. but i tried to stick it out since i know with retinol it is worse before it gets better. i also wanted to give the produce it is fair shot to work. but this was a huge failure and i really wish i never bought it honestly. now i have to spend the next few months repairing the damage.,negative
"use with caution if you have sensitive skin prone to fungalyeast acne infections. there is a warning label that comes with the sk-ii essence stating this. i did think twice when reading the label, but given how excited and how long i would been waiting to try this highly raved about essence, i went ahead and risked it. regrets!!!previously i dealt with a few small fungal acne issues around my nose more than years ago, which was treated by a dermatologist with appropriate rx. since then my skin has been clear and free of any fungal acne flare ups... until using sk-ii. sad to say my skin does not love pitera yeast. not to mention the essence smells like dirty feet.i only used the essence twice, did not see any mind-blowing benefits to the appearance of my skin. given the price tag of the sk-ii, would expect this to give some sort of glow or toningclarifying benefits with a few uses, but nope... nothing but a fungal acne flare up. unfortunately, what is left in my small sample bottle is going in the trash.",negative
very thin consistency and just seems to sit on the skin! it does not feel very hydrating either. i have combo skin lily t zone and this did nothing for me. i actually cannot wait until i get through it,negative
i love this oil cleanser. it is perfect for removing makeup. it smells good and is so gentle on my face. i have combination skin and it makes it feel so good. it removes all of my makeup too.,positive
"this mask is literally so dumb lol. not for acne prone skin, not for people with active acne. the mask can be used in a variety of ways primer, mins, overnight. i tried using it for mins and while it was on, it was incredibly hydrating. however, the directions say to just wipe off the mask with a towel. you cannot do this if you have active acne because it will irritate your skin. i have active acne so i washed off the mask, and it immediately removed all hydration effects. it was like i had not used the mask at all. this mask might be good for people who only have dryness as a skin concern. not for people with any other concerns eczema, acne, flaking which would become worse from wiping.",negative
not the best if you have light skin. it is a little too glowy for me to the point it is a little over the top. it looked great on my friend with olive skin however. it is fine under makeup but i cannot pull it off without makeup unless i dilute it a bit with supergoops unseen sunscreen which i love,neutral
after a long day in new york city my skin is exposed to all sorts of pollution and stresses my skin and wrinkles. the night serum helped my skin reset and rejuvenates my skin. this also helps with the following day because it helps with uv-induced damage. i put this all over my face and neck! it is a great consistency and gets onto the skin quickly without feeling heavy.,positive
i received this in a sample pack. not sure if it was the old or new formulation but did not seem to do much for my skin. nice if you want an extra clean before moving on to other steps but otherwise not a must have for me.,neutral
"i bought this cleanser without realizing it was also a makeup remover. i generally dislike in products because they are usually not good at either thing they are intended to do. this product was no exception. it does not work as a makeup remover because it does not remove or dissolve mascara, just moves it around, and slightly tugs at your skin like another reviewer stated. i am skeptical about it fully cleaning my skin because i feel like it leaves a tiny film over my skin. if i do not do a second cleanse after using the product, my skin feels and looks congested. for me, this product could only be used at night, for a first cleanse, if i am wearing no makeup just mineral sunscreen- which is not often. therefore it does not fit into my skincare routine. i would reach for my farmacy beauty green clean each time, which does a superior job of dissolving all makeup.this product would work for someone who wears no makeup, and wants to use this as a first cleanse to remove sunscreen. or, this would be perfect as a one-and-done for someone who thinks their cleanser should remove makeup and is not going to use makeup remover or a double cleanse system. since i am not a one-and-done girl, this is not for me and there is no real place to fit it in. i wish it were a plain old cleanser and not a makeup remover- i love biossance esp their sunscreen and was really excited to try this elderberry cleanser. the color is beautiful and texture is pretty too- just wish it were not a in product- but guess i should have read the label more closely.",neutral
"i received this product complimentary from glow recipe for reviewing purposes, review is completely honest as the brand instructed to be completely honest and non biased. i have been using it for a few weeks and have been really enjoying it before my moisturizer in the am and pm. it layers really well with everything i have used before and after- a little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly into the skin leaving my face feeling very hydrated without feeling oily or greasy. could be used alone, it is light weight and easy to apply so really enjoy the texture. i like it more than i expected and will keep using and enjoying it.",positive
"i have been using this oil for over a year, so i do not understand all the hyped reviews. do not get me wrong, it is a lovely oil. i am very sensitive to fragrances and this does not irritate me. it has a lovely scent. the oil consistency is lightweight. once applied to the skin, it leaves a slightly oily feeling, which eventually gets absorbed to your skin. now, here is where i have an issue with this product. after months of using this every day, morning and night, i have not seen a difference in my skin complexion or texture. i have dry to normal skin, with a few minor hyperpigmentation spots. i have not seen an improvement in those spots using this vitamin c face oil alone. i would have to use a different serum to see better results. i do not see a difference in firming or having a smoother texture. again, i would have to use a different product to see better results. for this alone, i do not see the hype or why it costs so much money for this face oil. i will finish up what is left in my bottle but i will not be repurchasing.",neutral
first time ever my skin gets allergy and turns red because of makeup product. thanks for the experience!,negative
"first, the positives. it is nice that you only need to have it on for hours. the finish is perfect, even and not patchy at all, smoother than their classic tan. does not stain. it lasts a good few days. that said, i was pretty disappointed with this product. i am ghostly pale so i did not expect to get super dark, but after hours i was only slightly tanned. i have gotten darker with their classic tan. the thing i really dislike is that you do not actually get a deeper colour as time goes on, rather you become bronzier and more yellow-ish. it is not orange or anything, but it definitely is not the nice brown tone advertised, either. this is not an actual express tan the colour still takes hours to develop, even if you can wash it off in. also, i found that the smell lingered the entire time i wore the tan-- perfume and body lotion covered it, but it was there until i scrubbed it off but this is true of every tan i have tried.",neutral
"so far, so good with this product! i have used it for about a week now, which i know is a short period of time, but it is very refreshing on my skin. i like the mild smell and the coolness it provides, while also diminishing blemishes. also it goes really far! just two small pumps of liquid twice a day.",positive
"took off my makeup amazingly and felt so moisturizing, but i ended up with a bad allergic reaction. this entire line flared up my rosacea. so sad",negative
"really wanted this product to work, but sadly it did nothing. dried my skin out a lot, even with extra moisturizer. if you do not make sure every bit of it is off it will wreck makeup application.",negative
"man, i did not like anything i ordered this time so good thing i spent and they forgot my samples. but this lotion...i really do not like the smell, and i did not feel like it did enough for my dry prairie skin. it was not the miracle moisturizer so many claim it to be. honest to god oil of olay works just as well and does not smell like wasp bait.",neutral
i have been using both luna oil and good genes daily for the past weeks now and i love the way my skin looks overall other than my chin area. i have been getting big blind pimples on my chin which is unusual. wanted to love this oil but i think it is the culprit of my breakouts. will try cutting down to three times a week but if these pimples persist i will have to let it go.,negative
i did not like this product that much. it made my hair feel sticky even if i used it on damp or dry hair. i usually let my hair air dry so that may be the issue but the instructions say you can. i would not really recommend.,positive
i have not seen a change in my skin since using this but i would need to use it awhile longer to see a difference.,neutral
"it is not a bad product, but for the price i feel there are significantly better options. the texture of the product feels greasy on your fingertips but has a smooth application. it did not pair well with my regular products, and left a bit of a tacky residue. i only attempted to apply makeup over it once and everything balled up so much i washed my entire face and started all over again, applying the scant remains of my go to sunscreen. i regularly use glow recipe for skin care and a mix of urban decay, fenty, and benefit makeup for reference.",negative
i gave this a because it works really well for my husband but not for me. as a little background i have seborrheic dermatitis. i have found a collection of different vitamin c serums that i have been able to use without causing a reaction. this is not one. i had put it on in the morning and did not really feel any immediate burn or zing. put on my glasses as i do every day. then by the time it came for me to start washing my face for bed i realized that right in my t zone it was all aflame and red. it was like a burn. its the next day now and i am trying to treat my skin gently to help remedy the sore like redness. i am sure this product is awesome but maybe not for those with sensitive skin.,neutral
"with the constant hand washing and hand sanitizing, my hands have been wrecked! this has saved my cuticles from the constant hangnails i was getting. i recently saw a tip about putting a drop of argan oil where you intend to spray perfume to help the scent last longer, and it really works!",positive
def recommend getting the smaller one. try it out if it works buy this one. did not work for me... might work for you though.,neutral
"this product works well at reducing the appearance of fine lines. i have used it on my crows feet around the eyes and have noticed a smoother appearance. however, i do have dry skin and noticed that i need to make sure to moisturize in conjunction with this product. overall, i would recommend to erase all those years of tanning bed damage i caused to my skin without going for botox.",positive
"i ordered the. oz to try it in the meantime while waiting for tatcha to come back in stock. i was beyond impressed- this is a lightweight yet an effective, hydrating moisturizer! especially in winter, my cheeks and mouth area were getting dry i have combination skin. it is lightweight enough to go under makeup and does not interfere with primer. there is a light scent which i love. i am inclined to buy this full size next time. coworkers have commented my skin is glowing via vid chats!",positive
"i am allergy to this product. after i have been using for three day, i fell that my eyes were puffy and itchy under my eyes. so i have to returned it. i was looking foward to this product, unfortunately is not for me",negative
an excellent spot treatment. dries out large problem zits and takes down redness substantially. this is a go-to for me for angry whiteheads that pop up on back or bum as well.,positive
"i do like this product but i certainly do not find it to be the holy grail i have seen many others claiming it is. the smell does not bother me, it is fairly strong but it does not smell bad to me, and the scent goes away pretty quickly. i get everything from minor white heads to painful cystic breakouts, and while i do find this does help tone breakouts down, it pretty much stops there. i find it hard to believe anyone with serious acne was miraculously saved by this product. the only reason i do not feel like the price tag is ridiculous for the quality is because this lasts you forever. if i buy the standard size i can use it every day and still only have to purchase, maybe a year. over all, this is a helpful product for those who struggle with breakouts, but certainly not a miracle worker.",neutral
does not do much for my pores but it works almost like magic for my maskcne these days definitely worth the purchase and i would happily buy again,positive
"overall, i do like these drops! they give a pretty nice bronze glow. i use them in my night time skincare routine about xweek so as not to overdo it since the rest of my body is not quite as bronze, haha. i add about drops to my moisturizer before going to bed and i wake up with a nice bronze glow! be really careful about blending it around areas like your nose, eyebrows, and hairline, though- the color can build up in these areas and look a bit too darkshaded. it does seem to last for a while, too, and does not come off as too orangey or fake. i think it is a nice alternative for someone like me who is fairly new to self-tanners and was trying to save a couple bucks!",neutral
"love the heat! i have not noticed any significant changes since starting this, but unlike the other oil control products in this line, this did not increase breakouts- so there is a positive!",neutral
it definitely relieves my puffiness and dark circles!!! i have only used it every morning under my eye cream. for me it does not provide enough hydration alone. a little goes a long ways and less than a full pump is more than sufficient. the eye gel absorbs nicely creating smooth skin under the eye. my eyes looked rested and fresh!!!! goodbye puffy allergy dark circle eyes!!!,positive
"i love the alpyn eye cream so i was excited to try this- it has a lovely smell and feels nice. unfortunately my skin is too dry and sensitive and my dermatitis came back within a week of using this. if you have normal skin this might work well for you, but i will be using it as body lotion to finish it up.",neutral
i have been using this for a few weeks. i like it! i usually buy a vit c and oil separately but this came together.,positive
"i started this product with barely any acne probably breakouts on my chin, hormonal stuff and ended with spots on my outer cheekbones, forehead, and multiple spots on my chin and jaw. for a bit i shrugged it off as my skin purging but eventually gave up because i was weeks in and my skin was still freaking out. it was a really nice consistency and i genuinely liked the application and gentle honey scent, my skin just lost its ever-loving mind over it.",neutral
"i loveeeee how lightweight this moisturizer is and the smell of it is fresh and great. but i do not think it is very hydrating! i have combination skin with very little dryness, but even i need to use so much of this to feel any sort of moisturizing or hydrating effect at all. the lightweight feel is nice, but as a moisturizer i am going to have to try something else.",neutral
"i do not mind the product, no adverse effects. the smell is not great but i did not mind it although i do not understand added fragrances? plan to use it up but will not repurchase. i was intrigued by and wanted to try a retinol alternative as i do not quite need it yet, but would probably just buy a low dose retinol next.",neutral
this is the best moisturizer ever! i have tried every brand out there and this is great for my dry skin. i use it morning and night and my skin feels glowy and hydrated. highly recommend.,positive
"i have tried a lot of skin care products very few of them really impress me. i have not found many where i can actually see a difference but this product is amazing. i got the mini size to try and am already purchasing the full size. i have combination skin, dry on my nose and mouth and oily all over everywhere else. hydration has been key for me keeping hydrated skin overall using this at night has done that. i also love the slight lavender smell, it is not overpowering but just enough to be relaxing.",positive
warning your skin will purge the first few times you use this serum! that is not a bad thing it just means your skin is getting rid of all the bad that is stuck in it. after the purge period my skin looks amazing my pores are tighter i have no pimples on my face currently so i think if you want to give this a try just stick with it for a little while because you may think your skin is getting worse but it is not it is actually getting better. i do think that there should be some warning on the box about purging so that is why i am giving it four stars but overall i love this product.,positive
i did not care for this at all. i should have gotten a sample before purchasing. i found it to be greasy and strong with perfume fragrance. i returned it to the store. it just did not work for me.,negative
"not a fan. i am used to shiseido but decide something new. it is not bad but after shiseido feels like a downgrade. feels and smells like a regular shampoo. terrible dispenser, after couple weeks of using it gets hard to squeeze it out. have to use both hands and push hard to get anything out.",negative
"this product was gifted to me to review. i received innisfree daily uv defense sunscreen complementary from octoly. finding the perfect sunscreen that gives you the right amount of uv protection without clogging pores has been challenging for me. i have tried several sunscreens but after few days, my face starts breaking up. i have been using innisfree spf sunscreen for couple of days and i can honestly say that i am really happy with the results. this sunscreen is easy to apply and the texture is not too thick. absorbs quickly into the skin. i consider it to have a very light sunscreen scent, but goes away quickly. one thing that i really love about this sunscreen is that it does not leave a white cast residue and a greasy oily skin. i appreciate that it does not have harmful chemicals, just natural ingredients like green tee, cica and sunflower seed oil. great ingredients to avoid skin damage and wrinkles. i use it as a moisturizer as well because it is hydrating and soothing my skin. great to use with your regular make up or showing your natural look. overall, i am extremely happy with innisfree. i recommended this product to anybody with acne prone skin or just looking to improve their skin complexion while protecting form the sun.",positive
at first i do not like because of the texture.... the i just notice makes my face clear and it helps my oily skin. i am using tacha and drunk elephant before although they are good... for my asian oily skin this one is the best so far. on my second container and loving it each day.,positive
love this formula for my daily skincare. loveeeeee the packaging and glassy look of this product. will definitely buy again,positive
"i bought this looking for a high quality mask that would help with anti-aging and texture issues. honestly, it did not do as much as i was expecting for the price. it did not have any negative effects on my skin, but honestly i do not notice any difference and i have been using it exactly as intended, once a week every week for about six weeks now. no real difference at all.",neutral
"the product is nice, feels more like a toneressence than a serum though, its super light. i would not recommend this to people with dry skin, it suits my oily skin well. this is not the most hydrating out there, but it suits well to be used underneath makeup. there is something wrong with the packaging, mine was leaking everywhere even though i kept it standing on my counter. i rinsed the bottle once but the next days i saw that it has leaked again even though i kept it standing upwards.",neutral
to be honest i wish i did not give this product no stars but i had to choose one. i used as directed after the minutes i rinsed my face with warm water and when i looked in the mirror my face was so red! i am not sure why this happen but i will never use this product again. i am am very disappointed!,negative
works so well!!!!! smells a bit bad when in the bottle but does not smell much while on your face. lost a lot of redness and scars with this product.,positive
"wonderful eye catching cream! i have tried there face cream that almost looks the same, let me tell you- this is on a whole different level. the texture is so creamy and makes a huge difference with my old year old eye wrinkles. i apply in the am and the evening. i notice a huge difference in the puffiness in the am diminishing. i have some age spots freckles that also look like there fading! yttp is an incredible line! i have tried almost everything they have put out except that coffee scrub, that is next and i am always blown away and never disappointed. walter approves too!",positive
"first of all let me just say the price is amazing. i have been trying to reduce acne scars forever. when this hit the site in january i purchased just to try along with another expensive serum i could use with this in hopes of reducing years old acne scars. i figured the price was right and if i did not like it i would not take a hit. this product made me love skincare because it was the first time i truly saw a difference and the price was so right!! i apply it all over the face morning and night and may acne scars have significantly lightened. only months in and i see major results. consistency is key however with anything so use this consistency and you will see results. when i ran out of this bottle i continued to use my expensive serum and noticed my results were not progressing as fast as before. after this restocked and i started to use it again the lightening process has continued. the ha in this helps with texture and over all complexion. i find my skin to be much smoother and texture to be almost healed. under the fullest of full face makeup this does not disturb anything. i have read reviews complaining this feels tacky, but for me it does not bother me in the slightest. considering the price alone this is so worth it. such an amazing product, i cannot rave enough.",positive
love this product. it hydrates my eyes while brightening my dark circles!,positive
i wanted to love this product but after wearing it overnight it irritated my skin and caused dryitchy patches for over a week now. not worth it for the amount of,negative
"i love this serum. i received a deluxe sample and it not only leaves my skin supple and smooth, it smells great and it is lasting a long time. will definitely purchase in the future.",positive
"i would not call this a moisturizer by itself if using it for that purpose. this feels more like a primer and it does go on smoothly over skin. the only con for me was that this had a strong perfume-like fragrance even after application and that is what made me return this product. i expected more from dior but sadly, this was a disappointment.",negative
"the value size. oz is not actually a value. this product is only good for months, and after use this product for six months, i still have a lot of product left and i was my face-x a day. stick to the normal size if you want to get your moneys worth!",neutral
"tiny tube. i have used it a few times and i am not sure yet if it is worth the hefty price tag...honestly, just putting sweet almond oil directly on the areas as much as needed, often for me... works better so far.",neutral
i wanted to love this cream but it progressively made my skin somehow more dry as i kept using it. one extra star for the packaging.,negative
takes a while to see results but has slowly helped with hyperpigmentation. also i would recommend only using- drops otherwise you will be left with a soup residue that takes a while to soak into the skin.,positive
"i got it complimentary frominsfluenster i have used this product like everyday. and it works for the time being or or few hours of used. i saw a difference on my y skin but not to the point that it get rid of big pores, fine lines and white heads of my face. its absorbs nicely on the skin, not runny not thick it is balanced. it is not oily or anything it is a good product overall. will i recommend it? in my personal opinion,with its price, i expect it to be the best of the best but it is not. will i buy it personally? probably not, it is too pricey for what it offers and effectivenes! packaging is cute and luxurious but i prefer what is inside than what it looks!",neutral
i received this complimentary from topboxcircle for my honest review. i have been using this for a little over three weeks and i can honestly say that i see improvement in my skin. i had a full hysterectomy years ago and am not on hrt therefore my body is not producing any collagen. my skin looks and feels firmer as well as my skin tone looking a lot healthier. radiant! i love that the serum is natural as well as being vegan. the texture is light and silky and absorbs beautifully. i use it morning and night. it layers great under primers and makeup. price is steep but it is worth it!,positive
i received a sample of this and i really did not like it. the texture is very light almost watery and i do not feel like that it did anything on the moisture front. i would wake up the next morning just as dry- it also did not reduce my redness at all.,negative
"truly moisturizing without looking grease. this works like a wonder. every time my skin looks dull and dry throughout the day, applying this moisturizer just magically changes the game. my skin instantly looks plump and healthy.",positive
"it smellls sooooo good! but i honestly do not think it is worth. i would buy it for-, but the quality does not match the price.",neutral
"this product has saved my skin. i have combination, acne-prone skin and tried hundreds of products. this is on my top to prevent and get rid of acne, while protecting and restoring the skin barrier. it is gentle yet effective. it calms redness and acne and restores the skin. it is pricey, but worth every penny. i believe it is the combination of ceramides ceramide np, ns, ap, eop, eos and avocado oil. it is lightweight and non-greasy. you can use it everyday or as a rescue serum for acne breakouts or to soothe redness. i highly recommend. ig honestbeautyreviewcanada",positive
"this product softened my skin like no other i am such a fan!! it has a really light consistency and is easy to pat in, so it never felt heavy or sticky on my skin. it is also incredibly refreshing, and had a noticeably firming effect on my skin.",positive
had great reviews so i tried it- whatever tint they put in it does not blend in at all leaving caky residue all over my eyes even if i use a tiny amount. it also pills under other makeup. did not notice any results that would make it worth buying again.,negative
i really wanted to like this because i like other products by this brand but it burns my eyes!!!! cannot use it.,negative
"i was excited to try this when i received this in my vox box to test from influenster. this serum is slightly viscous and goes on smoothly. after a week of wearing i had no adverse reaction. at the same time i noticed minimal difference but to be fair this is formulated to be used daily. all in all, i would not repurchase at this hefty price tag as there are other effective and affordable chemical exfoliants on the market.",neutral
"i was so excited to try this. i got a sample in ipsy and have been using it for a few weeks but it does nothing for my skin. if anything i feel likes its drier than usual... it is also quite heavy, do not use it before your makeup.",negative
gave this to one of my friends and she loved it.,neutral
this lotion just was not for me. it does have a strong scent however that goes away. when i applied it to my skin it felt very hydrating and rich however it left my skin feeling dry and i am a combo skin type. given the price of this lotion i was expecting more.,neutral
"received from influencer for honest review. i honestly do not really care for this product. first of all it was pretty tacky and took a little while to no longer feel sticky, which i already dislike skincare that makes your skin feel tacky but it is worse when it is near your eyes. i also cannot really tell if it did anything, plus i did not really like how it made my skin feel.",neutral
this product literally does nothing for my skin. i used consistently for months and still have not noticed even a slight change in my dark spots. this was a total waste of money.,negative
this gel formula moisturizes my face but leaves it feeling very greasy and i feel like it might be causing more little bumps on my face than smoothing it out.,neutral
the cream itself is decent but i cannot get past the smell. it is so awful to me.,neutral
"i wish i could use it! i should have taken the skin type normal to oily more serious for this product, i have normal to dry skin and it dried me out like crazy. however, the color tint was suitable for a lot of skin types in my opinion and rubbed in very nicely. so if you have normal to oily skin, it would be the best sunscreen for you.",neutral
"i bought these strictly for the fun aspect. it is great for girls night but does not really hydrate as best as others, but super cute packaging and you get a decent amount of them for the price.",neutral
"this does not remove makeup, certainly not eye makeup. do not buy this. there are many other far less expensive cleansers try cerave that are gentle and still remove makeup.",negative
i switch from cetaphil to this cleanser because of its clean ingredients. i usually have non problematic skin with no breakouts but the entire time i used this i had acne on my chin and lower face. it took me some time to realize and as soon as i switched back to my old cleanser it cleared up. i would not recommend,negative
the spray is alright. i did not notice any noticeable changes after two weeks of use. also i loathe the scent. it smells funny. cannot describe it. lucky i wore it indoors. would not get caught wearing it outside.,neutral
not good for dry skin. not moisturizing at all. probably better for someone with oily skin. so light it just feels like you put water on your face and rubbed it around... makes me feel sweaty,negative
i have been using this product to protect my skin against the sun and it is been amazing!! i love that it not only protects my skin but gives it a beautiful shiny glow while doing it! i apply this to my skin after washing my face for easy protection. this is a completely honest review and are my genuine thoughts about the product! i want to purchase some for my mom as well!,positive
"i am just blown by this suspension! not gritty at all as some of the reviews state, a little bit oily but it quickly gets absorbed. i put it at pm after my retin-a and i wake up to a nice and smooth skin! never used a vit c creme before but did bot experience any stinging whatsoever. the price is just amazing! this is already a part of my skin routine for sure!",positive
"this product did not do anything for my skin but make it worse!!! i had hopes, but did not come true!",negative
"i like to take my time washing my face and although this formula is ok, it smells just like tatchas the deep cleanse, and there is something about that i just do not like. i would say if you tried that product and liked the scent, but have normal to drier skin this would be a good one to try. i say drier skin, because i do feel like it dried out my skin more than other cleansers i have used. i like tatchas rice polish, but will not repurchase this cleanser i did purchase it during the welcomeback promotion.",negative
"love the product, but disappointed that it is not as good as her what now seems to be discontinued version moisturizer that was in the bluegreen container just like this. that went on much easier, as to this new oil free product seems thick and does not cover my face in one pump the way the old one did. so i have to use more product... and it does not seem as hydrating either.",neutral
i have always been a super simple skin routine person. with that being said i was not previously using a toner. i ordered this one along with all the fenty skin line on a whim. i am glad i did! i did wait a few weeks before writing my review as i wanted to be sure i saw something. while i will not say my pores are smaller they do appear slightly less congested and i thankfully did not have any purging from this product! as with the whole fenty skin line the cherry scent and it is amazing! i had been with my previous skin routine for a long time and i am glad i took a chance to mix it up. definitely will reorder!,positive
good creamy feel. no scent. it was just ok with the fine lines.,neutral
"the best treatment i have used on my face. i struggled with acne scars all over my forehead for over a year but after using this consistently once a week, i hardly have any now. however, this product alone will most likely not be a miracle worker and i recommend finding a skin routine that works best to you and then incorporating this product. i started to see results a month after using this. these pictures are year apart using this product on and off.i do not recommend this for sensitive skin! i do not have sensitive skin and this has a little bit of a tinglingburning sensation on my face when i use it so i cannot imagine how this would work with someone who does have that skin type. also please use spf after using this!!",positive
"i purchased this during the sephora vib sale in august, and i have gone through about half of the oz bottle. overall i am not impressed. i do not feel like this did anything special to my skin. i do not feel like it faded acne scars. it is nice as part of a fancy skincare routine, but by itself, it caused me to break out. i had replaced this to use as a toner instead of my previous one, and it clogged my pores and caused me to break out in small bumps on my forehead. i added my other toner back into my routine, and the bumps cleared up. i will use the bottle up too expensive to throw away, and i have used too much to return, but i will definitely not repurchase. i will be glad to have one less step in my routine!!",negative
"i have been using la mer products since and i am very happy with it. my skin is very sensitive and in the winter it gets so dry because i live in nyc. la mer products are the only one that keeps my skin hydrated and brighter. i am so in love with the new treatment lotion by la mer i have been using it after i cleanse my face. i apply a few drops and gently press into my skin it absorbs super fast. it feels like a very thin serum, the scent is light, it is super hydration and it does not leave my skin sticky. i follow up with the concentrate for face by la mer, the eye concentrate by la mer and the moisturizing soft cream by la mer",positive
"thank you to the person who warned us about the scent. i went to the store to see this product in person instead of ordering it. this oil smells very strongly of fish by-product and it is disgusting. i rolled it on my hand and the consistency seemed nice but the smell of this was so awful i could not justify purchasing this. i take fish oil capsules every day but this is different. i cannot believe that they could not find a way to rework the scent of this oil. personally, it was too much for me to overlook. i cannot imagine rubbing this under my eyes and i highly suggest you test this before buying.",negative
it did not work for me and make my face breaking! has a nice smell and i would not recommend this.,negative
love a light and silky primer. i was really surprised to see peace out skincare with a primer because they have bomb skincare and i am glad they are expanding into the makeup industry. i really love how this primer holds my makeup!,positive
every skin type is different. when i read the reviews i got very exited that i found a good cleanser. it came in with a broken pump so i had to open and use directly from the bottle. smell of it nice and it feels good when i wash with it first. but then it dried my skin bad. i tried one more time next day but it gotten worse,negative
"this product did not really do much for me, tried it for about months",neutral
feels nice. cooling on the skin. no speedy results.,neutral
"from on the left to on the right. started as every other day for weeks, then daily for weeks. buy it, seriously. i even took these pictures at the exact same time so the lighting will not vary. i purchased this with my hard owned money and will keep buying it to use on other hyperpigmented parts of my body.",positive
worth it!!!!! kept me moisturized all winter. i have combo skin never did i feel more oily. now i have used a retinol and i keep using it on the nights when i use my retinol to keep me extra soft.,positive

"not the best. not to mention this argan oil has been deodorized to have no scent. no thanks. i will take the real deal. also, although true organic cold pressed argan oil should not be cheap, there is no reason for it to be this expensive... your paying for the brand... foxbrim makes a far superior argan oil.",negative
"i purchased this a couple of months ago.i am with great skin when it comes to elasticity, however, have begun to notice one single fine line under each of my eyes. the beginning of crepey skin. i have not noticed any significant changes with this product. it does seem to add some shimmer and moisturization.i also notice that when i wear a little concealer over it that it adds to the heavy creasing effect. i use urban decay and nars concealer for under eye. i also use it sparingly. with all that said, i prefer to use this without makeup, around the house, or makeup-free days. it does feel nice, but that is not enough for this price. i am happy to use the rest of the product, but i will not be purchasing it again.",negative
"i never write review of any products, but this was an absolute disaster. first, the back of the packaging is pretty vague stating use- drops. i decided to be conservative for my first time using it and only applied drops in with my moisturizer and allowed my tan to develop over night. i woke up with the patchiest orangepink toned tan i have ever seen. the orange tan grabbed to areas all around my mouth. i scrubbed my face times before work and the orange stain would not come off. i went to work with makeup on over top to try and disguise the hideous patches, but since i could not get the color to come off after i scrubbed, the tan developed even darker more orange in the patches throughout the day. i finally got home from work and looked literally as patchy as possible. not to mention, it clung to all texture. i highly do not recommend this product unless your skin is perfect.",negative
this product does not touch your acne. i read all the comments thinking it would work wonders and thought oh theirs so many good comments and so few bad it will be fine. do not buy this its not worth it!!!,negative
"i love a good balmoil cleanser, but this one really fell short for me. i was excited when i saw another affordable brand release a balm cleanser. i am a fan of tos squalana cleanser, but this one is even less expensive. the texture of this one is promising and felt as if it did not require much work to turn oily. however this does not rinse clean, it leaves a film on the skin and its not even that great at breaking down the dirt and makeup on the face. even though i was only using as a first cleanse, i do not expect my first cleanse to leave a film on my face. honestly just not my favorite product. the price is great but the product still fell very short for me. i will not repurchase.",neutral
"i have been using this for several weeks now and my initial and still reaction is, great moisturizer. at first application it feels amazing and my skin feels looks super hydrated. however, i like to work my product in a little gentle pats or gua sha which unfortunately causes some of the moisturizer to turn into tiny gel clumps. i stopped pattingany kind of extended massage. secondly, i have not had a good experience using this with makeup tinted moisturizer, foundation stick, concealers, powders etc. i have tried leaving it on a few minutes before application and it still turns into clumps that i would have to dust off, sometimes wash my entire face again. i want to love this but do not. i am considering returning itswitching to the water drench hyaluronic acid moisturizer.",neutral
"no clue how people think this removes makeup, it literally does nothing. just smears my makeup around my face and removes nothing. most cleansing oils feel very slippery and remove most of the makeup then i do a second cleanse with a gel cleanser always to remove everything left. this product feels thick and i prefer a more oily oil cleanser so it slips and does not tug at my skin especially the eye area. it literally just makes a big mess on my face. disappointed!",negative
"i have been using this product for a couple months now and finally reached a verdict. it is hard to say definitively this product reduced the appearance of my pores but it appears to keep them less clogged. i integrated this serum into my skincare routine without much trouble which is an achievement if it is own since i have highly reactive sensitive skin. on top of that the salicylic acid also helped keep my skin smooth and reduced, not eliminate, redness. i have an urge to want to buy this product again when it is finished as i am already halfway through the bottle but i am still a little undecided on whether the benefits i have seen are worth the price...",positive
"seeing that this enzyme scrub retails at., i really wanted to test this out multiple times before really making a judgement. any other opinion i may have gathered after only the first or second use, good or bad could be considered jumping the gun. i do think for the amount of product you get, considering the amount you actually need to achieve max possible results, the price is fair... if only it did...more? do i think it is gentle, yes. does it burn like some other similarly textured exfoliators? no. does it rinse clean? yes. does it make my skin softer? somewhat. does it provide my skin with a radiant glow? umm, no. that is the main problem here. the products claim to fame here is that it will reveal glowing skin, however it does not, not for me at least. the texture is not what i would imagined. to describe the texture, i would say to imagine yoiil",neutral
i really liked this product. i have acne prone skin and it did not irritate it at all. the scrub is nice too because it dissolves after you scrub for a little while- i usually stop once the scrub dissolves and let it sit for a bit on my face before i rinse. another plus is that the scent is nice and not strong.,positive
"great, thick moisturizer. i use more often on my neck than my face but it does not break my neck out like some other creams do. i really love the way it makes my skin feel.",positive
"paulas choise gifted me me with its serum c super booster. i liked that i received this serum to try. i liked that i received this serum to try. i can already say that this was one of the best serums with vitamin c that i have tested. my skin absorbed this serum well, it does not leave a sticky sensation on the skin. in the first application, i noticed my skin was brighter. my skin was wonderful using this serum. i am using it in my skin care routine in the morning. this serum leaves my skin with a very beautiful glow. i am really loving paulas choice products and this vitamin c a lot.",positive
"this is a great self tanner! i am very fair, and the color is light but noticeable after one application. the smell is very light probably the weakest scent out of any tanner i have tried, and it is not greasy. it dries quickly and i do not feel like it transfers onto clothes or sheets like others do right after application. the color is natural even on really fair skin, and it applies evenly and not streaky even when you are in a rush.",positive
"i absolutely love first aid beauty, i have tried majority of this line and never had a negative experience. this cream was recommended from a sephora employee as i mentioned i have combination skin i should have gone with the collagen cream instead this cream does not really do much as it is oil free so it can suck out the moisture which i need i would not buy it again but if you have heavy oily skin then this would work in your favor.",neutral
"reviewing the thirst quenching serum since there is not a link. i tend to stay away from serums because they are usually sticky and oily but decided to try this since my skin is so dry. so glad i did, no stickiness or oiliness at all! it makes my skin soft. very hydrating and is great in combination with their vinosource-hydra grape water gel cream moisturizer. the scent is fresh and slightly floral to me, not overpowering. good amount of product in the bottle. packaging is nice and weight of it feels high end. i now use this as a part of my day and night skincare routine. freeproduct",positive

"i really wanted to like it. i love the glowy look and thought a little pore minimizing would not hurt, but i felt like this made my skin feel dry, especially when taking it off. i guess i just need that little bit of oil that my skin provides and this keeps it from coming out which is kind of the purpose of the product ig. i do not think it is necessarily a bad product but i think my skin just does not do well with niacinamide. but my friend who is slightly oilier and acne prone loves it! would i personally recommend? meh, only if you have issues with oils and pores.",neutral
"i have had the product for about a month now. i would not use it every night because i am very lazy. but my laziness actually saved me. by day i had lil red bumps under one of my eyes. as soon as i noticed them i realized it was this because nothing else in my routine has changed. i really wished to like this product because this brand is amazing. maybe i should not use retinol. exchanged for a different eye cream, hope that one does not give me a rash under me eye.",negative
"i have combination skin that has been getting less oily as i age but this did not sit well with it. i feel after a month of use my t-zone is very oily again, it does not sink into my skin and makes me look very greasy, and i never feel moisturized after using it. i do like the smell though. i just do not think it is worth the money and it is the third fresh product i have tried that i do not like. probably will not try any others from this brand.",negative
"this product was an in-betweener for me. what i mean by that is, is that it did some amazing things to my skin. and the it did some not so amazing things for my skin. it cleared up those pesky white bumps on my temples and between my brows which amazed me because everything that i have ever used never makes those go away! but then this also made my chin breakout. it also gave me lone pimples on my under eyes which i never ever get. so i had to return it even though part of me loved it and part of me did not. if you have texture and uneven dull skin that can handle oils well, i highly recommend. but for girls like me with unpredictable problematic skin, i say give it a try but do not be too disappointed if it does not work out. it also takes a minute to sink into the skin as well, just a heads up. but it does not leave you oily so that is a great thing.",neutral
"i ordered this thinking it sounded like a great idea. the first one arrived and some of the liquid had leaked out into the packaging. contacted customer service they sent another...that one also leaked! sephora refunded me, which was great. i think there is an issue with the manufacturing, leakers in a row? yikes.",negative
does not work great. i like the consistency. it feels hydrating as your applying and does not migrate into your eyes as it says but overall i do not think it is made any difference at all in hydrating for more than a min,neutral

i was recommended this product by one of the sephora employees as being good for sensitive skin. it is not. i used it once and immediately noticed tiny bumps forming under my skin on my cheeks. it also caused my skin to burn a little. i wanted to give this a shot but it broke me out way more than i could have imagined.,negative
i received this as part of the birthday gift and must have received a product that was old. the serum was watery and sticky once applied to the skin. i did not like the way it felt and do not really want to continue using to find out if it does everything that is is supposed to do. i will look for something else that feels better on my skin.,negative

"a really great, very moisturizing eye cream that i have seen some improvement with! the downside this bottle is not the right shape for the cream. only a few weeks into it and i need to move the pump around or try to scoop some out barely possible because the pump stops sucking up the thick texture. reallyyyy unfortunate.",negative
as much as i love clinique this cream does not work for my dark cirles under my eyes. i do not have lines so maybe its for the lines but def not for the dark cirlces.,negative
i was not able to use this as directed because i have sensitive skin woke up with sad swollen eyes. use as a mask remove before sleeping if you have allergic responses to some products. i did not notice a difference in my skin using it only sporadically.,neutral

"does not remove eye makeup. will only work for your eyes if you apply directly with cotton- and the result? blurry eyes. green clean smells nice, and feels nice on the face, but it does not meltaway eye makeup. overpriced for what it is. much prefer my fresh soy cleanser that really does work on eyes, you can lather your whole face and rinse- unlike this product. would return if i could but have gone over return time limit.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from laneige. i liked the concept of the cream skin mist, but was not overall impressed. my skin felt soft and cool after misting my face, but it kind of felt like i had a layer of something is left behind. bottle was a little large so it would not be something i carried with me to use throughout the day. it was ok, but probably would not use it much.",negative
"the smell is like a mens cologne without the headache side effect. size is too small for the price. scent is very strong one spray is plenty in a well ventilated room, and lasts too long. i prefer products that are made with pure essential oils, not synthetic parfume. overall, i will use it carefully because it does smell good.",neutral
"i really wanted to love this product... but sadly i do believe this was the because of my breakouts! my boyfriend also tried it, and he started breaking out as well. i use their unseen sunscreen regularly and i love that stuff, no problems with breakouts! but this just did not work for my oilyacne prone skin. will be returning. definitely get a sample and try it out first!",negative

one of the worst makeup removers i have ever used. i do not know why this is so popular it does not take off my mascara and it is not water proof. i have to apply and rinse twice for my make up to come off and i have to scrub my face hard for it to even do anything. such a disappointment,negative
"i bought the cream for wrinkles and after a month, nothing. i am and this did not help with wrinkles, do not waste your money.",negative
it is a no for me. i like the idea. and i can see where their mind was but the cookies part of this mask do not dissolve easily. it takes quite a bit of pressure to burst them. and when smoothing it over your face the beads roll in between your fingers because again- they do not dissolve easily. the two stars are for the mask being gentle. i double cleansed then used this mask and it did not burn at all when i applied it. ultimately returning it.,negative
"i picked up the smallest jar available when it first came out, in hopes that it would work just as great as their green clean. unfortunately, like some other reviews have stated, it left that odd oily layer to my face no matter how much i rinsed off.i do love the packaging, but it was back to purchasing green clean.",positive
"i received plantgeniusr melt moisturizer with bakuchiol complimentary from alpyn beauty in exchange for my honest opinion. with that being said, i really do like this moisturizer. it is nourishing yet light or not too heavy. the scent is not my favorite but it is almost barely there. not overpowering like some other creams and dissipates quickly. i did not quite notice any lines disappearing immediately but that is not a make or break it for me. nice moisturizer that i am excited to continue to use.",positive
"i do believe in the benefits of an essence. the first one i ever tried was sk-iis and i love it but i was searching for an alternative because of the price point for. oz and this seemed comparable based off of reviews, plus you get double the product. i have combo skin but never visibly oily or even to the touch- this product changed that. i would apply day and night before any other product and noticed that my serums were not absorbing as well they seemed to just sit and i would pass on applying a night time moisturizer because of this. in the morning my face had a film to it and after a while my pores looked larger. i was not sure it was this but then one night i used this alone to see, applied nothing on my face but this water and the next morning my skin was oily. i had high hopes but we do not click- i would only recommend it based off of all the positive reviews, it is worth a shot, but pay attention to the absorbency. back to sk-ii for me!",neutral

"so let us start with i am a sucker for anything new. i have been on the hunt for a cleanser that can solve mask-acne. safe to say this may not be it. beautiful packaging and a decent product. if you are a semi to full face beat wearer this is not the cleanser for you. it is not very effective at removing makeup, not even as a second cleanse after makeup removal. however for a morning cleanserefresh it is great. very gentle and moisturizing. it does leaving a moisturizing feel on the skin. it is does not bother me. and did not disrupt my morning routine with other products or makeup app. so i will keep it for that. but for real cleansing of pores...this is not it.",neutral
i really did not like this product! it definitely dried up my dry skin,negative
"i initially really liked this product because it visibly made a big difference on my skin texture and dullnessi looked so fresh-faced and rested!. however, like into the bottle i stopped seeing major differences and my skin looked exactly like it had before. i do not think it is the product though and might just be my skin i am on my nd bottle and this one has not made such a big difference. i would still recommend this, but maybe perhaps a samplemini size first.",neutral
"i received this retinol in partnership with shani darden. this is my honest review after using it for days it feels much gentler than other retinols. i started with using retinol reform a few nights a week and by the end of the month i was using it every night with no dryness or irritation. so far, i have noticed some slight fading on the old acne scars on my cheek and fading on the fine lines under my eyes as well. i really have no complaints about this retinol and am happy with the results i am seeing so far!",positive
"i am big fan of glow recipes products and i got so excited when i have heard they were launching a sunscreen. this product has a delicate consistency and a very subtle scent that i enjoyed. it left my skin gooey and hydrated through the day without that white cast that i absolutely hate. another plus, it did not fight my makeup. it layered beautifully.",positive
"this moisturizer should not be seen as a clean product. it contains fragrance, a known irritant for skin and could be anything. it is tacky on my skin, does not absorb properly and just sits on top of my skin. absolutely terrible and a waste of money. not worth the hype you all.",negative
i received this today and i am loving it my face feels so smooth and hydrated,positive
it gets the job done but no serious change happened atleast in my skin. i would keep if it were not for the price...it does not work well enough for me for i think there is plenty of drugstore options that would do just as good of a job or not better,negative
"i am so impressed with this product! never in my life had i had such a fast acting product. the texture is a little deceiving because it is a little firm, but once you warm it up in your hands it really thins out and a little goes a long way!my skin is so much brighter and the texture has drastically improved, with my face definitely starting to lift. i do have a stubborn wrinkle across my forehead that has started to go away, but it is only been like weeks with this product and i have seen some improvement. i am giving this product a star because of the quick improvement, without breaking me out! got to love adult acne.",positive
results with this moisturizer are almost immediate! instant hydration and plumpness and better skin texture overnight. is a lot to spend but it would be stats otherwise,positive
"i do not think this is great for truly sensitive skin. most serums make my skin itchy, but i have been able to use a vitamin c from another brand and have had great, quick, and noticeable results. this one makes my skin itchy if i use it every day, so i try to use it every other day and only in the morning. i have not noticed an improvement in my skin using it this way. it makes my skin dewy upon application, and it does remain slightly tacky i have dry skin and feels sort of like a film. weirdly this feeling goes away only once i apply an spf over top of it. has a very faint fruity scent that dissipates quickly. the consistency reminds me of a gel-cream moisturizer. will not repurchase and will go back to the other vitamin c serum that has been working for me albeit it is twice the price of this one- why i wanted to love this one- wah wah.",neutral
"it is not thaaattt bad, but the high rating are crazy. this product is just glycerol. it cleansing powers are less than ideal........ if you have the most delicate, no product anything type skin this is for you. but if you have ever even looked at a glycolic, retionol or any sort of acid. this is not for you",negative
"i kind of like this. it does give you a dewy look but i feel it is over priced. my skin does not like niacinimide so i returned for that reason. i also notice that as soon as you put something else over it that the dewy finish goes away, even moisturizer or makeup",negative
this product is amazing!! it is pricey but i noticed how much brighter my skin looked! i recommend this product so much,positive

"so heavy and greasy feeling! i got a foil packet sample and it feels so suffocating. i live in hawaii so it is always humid and after minutes with this on i had to wipe it off. and this was in the morning with only something degree weather. could not even tough it out, just too oily.",negative
love this! i have combo skin and acne prone skin and it does not break me out or anything. evens everything out and gives a beautiful glow.,positive
"i have very sensitive, cystic acne prone skin from a lot of health issues and have struggled my entire adult life with my skin. once i got my acne under control, i was left with uneven texture and scaring. not to mention the pores from my oily skin. this product has changed my skin incredibly! my over oil production has diminished. my texture and large pores are smoother and smaller. my acne scaring has almost completely went away, and the glow and firmness makes me comfortable enough to go out without foundation! i use this once a week, for no more than- minutes. it does sting at first and if you leave it on too long, so may sure to set a timer. it is a chemical peel after all. the stinging subsides quickly. i follow with moisturizer and always use sunscreen with this product. everyone needs this. it is a game changer. not to mention the price!!",positive
"interesting idea for a product, but i kept trying to figure out how to use this stick. it just did not work with my routine. i was unclear how it would really benefit my skin besides a little moisture. i tried to use it under my eyes before makeup but it did not seem to allow my makeup to stay well. i also tried to use it over my makeup, but i use setting powder, so it kind of messed it up. i wanted to love it! the packaging is gorgeous and tatcha is a great brand. i think this would just be better for someone who uses liquid makeup and little to no powder.",neutral
"i have tried a lot of cleansers over the years, and this instantly became my new favorite! i got it as apart of a pack of caudalie products in mini sizes as i would already found success with their hand cream, and i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked everything in it. i have naturally very clear skin, but am prone to dryness, and start feeling it immediately after showering. using this cleanser regularly followed by their moisturizer soothed my skin and made it more pristine than ever before! one pump also goes a long way, and you have enough for your face and neck. finally, the scent is light but present, and feels clean without being overwhelming.!",positive
does not do much...have not noticed a chance in my under eye dullness.,negative
"hey guys, i was really excited to try this product out because of the great reviews, but i was surprised to find that it was really drying on my skin. i tried this about times to make sure it was not just a one time thing. pretty disappointed, though on the bright side the bottle is pretty so i can reuse it. hopefully this works better on you than it did on me!",negative
the product balls up a lot. not sure if my skin is absorbing the product. i have tried to keep moisture off my face as i am applying the cream but nothing seems to work.,neutral
"this gentle exfoliant works fine, it is just underwhelming to me. it is effective at washing away dead skin cells and smoothing out skin, but a bit too gentle for my needs. i think this is a good product for fresh and young s skin, or someone with sensitive skin, especially as there is no fragrance or scent either. but i am in my s so i do prefer a stronger peel that includes chemical exfoliants for better longer-lasting results. for that, i definitely choose ptrs pumpkin enzyme mask over this, and once weekly of that is enough for me. not to mention, i also love the pumpkin scent. the firmx peeling gel pills on contact, and by the way, that is not your skin rolling off, it is the cellulose ingredient doing that, which is helping to sweep away the dead skin cells. this one is very gentle, so even though directions say up to times a week, i think daily would be fine if needed. i can see this being a great quick mask to use before a night out for smoother application of your make-up too. in addition to the smoothness, the skin does feel soft and hydrated after use. but for that glow, again, i got to say i pick the pumpkin mask. or, i really enjoy ptrs cucumber mask if i am really needing extra hydration, and it still has the enzymes for light exfoliation to sweep away stubborn dead skin. so for me, this product does not have a place in my routine, but i can see it being great for some people. it is a little expensive, but it is not bad.",neutral
after using this my skin was very soft and dewy but it made my foundationconcealer pill up like crazy! i used my fingers to blend instead and after setting it looked really good just wish it did not pill,neutral
"i love this product. have bought it a bunch of times. it looks like nothing, but i have had friends say, you look airbrushed. i do not wear any kind of foundation because it looks terrible on me but this is just the perfect bare skin look- super light. great over moisturizer. i really got it as sunscreen but i will even use it at night in place of foundation for a slightly perfected look without looking like i have anything on. love it. it does not irritate my skin like other vit-c-containing stuff.",positive

"this serum is heavily scented! i tried the product in store and did not mind the scent maybe because the store is usually scented with so many cosmetics and perfumes. god this things smells awful and so strong! the smell lingers all day on your face and it makes me nauseous!! plus, it does not blend well with skincare products from other brands. especially does not work well with any of my sunscreen. i need to return this as soon as possible.",negative
"i actually really like this product. it smells so good. it is definitely hydrating and i use it throughout the day. however, i would not call it oil-controlling. my skin can great pretty oily throughout there day, and this helps a little bit, but it is not amazing. but it is better than everything else i have tried. i am knocking it down to three stars because it is s too expensive.",neutral
"this is the worst product i have tried from st tropez. they discontinued the old gradual tan firming lotion and replaced it with this one. it instantly sets and stains, there is nothing gradual about it. i used my hand first as this is the way i used to apply the old formula. it instantly turned my hand a greenish black seven after repeated washes. i used my mitt to apply the rest and i did not rub in one area of my leg fast enough and same problem instant blotchy streaks. after letting it dry for minutes i got dressed and it stained my clothes. worst tanner i have ever used! if i could give it zero stars i would.",negative
"i have dry skin and this stuff is so greasy, it never dries down and leaves you looking fully wet. even if you try to barely use any at all, it is just wet. and it slides all over the place and seeps into everything. no matter how hard i try i either get it in my eyes burns and then i have to go contact lens free for a day or two or on my lips and it tastes so bad it will gross you out all day, and you just cannot stop it from leaching into every single part of your face. forget putting makeup on top it will just slide all over the place and even with this stuff on, makeup will cling to dry patches but break up and float around other areas. i wanted to love this so much but it is the worst sunscreen i have ever used. ever. i would use a baby zinc paste that left me chalk white before i will put this stuff on again. and i have used it enough that most of it is gone because i really wanted to find a way to use it. it even makes my shoulders look too greasy, feel greasy and slippery and stick to my clothes etc. worthless. so disappointed i spent so much on this garbage.",negative
"very nice going on and wears well as a moisturizer under makeup because it does not shine through later. however, after one week of use, it made me break out with acne bumps on the temple and check area. i know it does not sound like a lot, but when are a victim of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation just by a bump surfacing, it is a big deal with my skin. i had to return it. i would still recommend because it is a great product. just did not work for me.",neutral
"i like that it did not feel heavy on my face. it felt like i was wearing nothing. no white cast, no weird smells. i have dark latte skin so i have never burned. i would not know how well it works as a sunscreen in that way. it also goes under makeup well. it does not feel layered and caked when you stack your normal makeup routine over it.what i do not like about it is it is not a flattering glow for me. i look sweaty or oily when i have done nothing. it really seems to point out my pores. i have always been told by facial specialists i have very tiny pores. but this product makes them look huge and i feel self conscious. i will not be repurchasing this specific product from supergoop.",neutral
this cream is probably more better suited for really dry skin. it is hella thick and hard to blend into the skin. does not feel light weight. i have to say it will moisturize you for sure but if you have the slightest oil it will accentuate it fold.,negative

not my fav at all. maybe i am using it wrong but it doesnt really lather and i do not feel like it even gets the top layer of my face clean let alone getting down in my pores.,negative

"i got the small size and am disappointed it did not come with a pump, making it a pain to pour it out every day. i wanted to try it first before committing to an expensive cleanser. it is refreshing and very soothing non irritable and good for sensitive skin. it does not feel like my face is completely clean and it does not foam up enough to my liking.",neutral

i have oilycombination skin and this made me times more oily. i also have used this for about two weeks and have not seen any results only my face being super oily. after reading the reviews i was so excited to use this product because it promised the same as my kheils re-texturizing gel right after my toner. it says for all skin types but it is not for oily skin. slick city on my face. will be returning to my khiels.,negative

"i received honey halo- ultra-hydrating ceramide moisturizer complimentary from farmacy beauty. i have dry acne-prone skin so i am very careful about trying new products. to my wonder, honey halo is paraben-free, cruelty-free, mineral oil-free, and synthetic fragrance-free. packed with the goodness of buckwheat honey, fig extract, shea butter, and plant-based ceramides. it comes in a nice thick glossy looking transparent glass jar with a wood grain finish lid. there is a cute little spatula that sticks magnetically to the lid. also on opening the lid, there is a white removable extra lid that helps to avoid exposure to air or moisture around. there is a slight smell of honey in it. the moisturizer inside looks like a dairy-rich cream butter. i am loving the metal spatula to take it out from the jar instead of using a plastic spatula or putting the fingers inside. the moisturizer is creamy and feels like butter on the skin without being heavy on the skin. and instantly i felt my skin was absorbing it, making me feel hydrated and plump. i am very happy with honey halo as it did not give me a breakout. i am applying it daily before bedtime and every morning after the bath. it keeps my skin hydrated and soft for hours.",positive
"this moisturizer has a nice gel texture that is not heavy, so great for more oily skin. but, i feel like it just sits on my skin and it caused small bumps on my forehead that went away as soon as i stopped using it. it works decent on my cheeks, but it is not super hydrating either. for the price, i do not like it and will not repurchase. but, i know many people who swear by this moisturizer so it is worth a shot.",neutral
