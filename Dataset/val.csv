"the scent is very pleasant, and the texture of the cream is really cool and refreshing. when i first started using it i thought it was a little too thick, but i have noticed that it absorbs really well into the skin. i will definitely repurchase.",positive
"i am completely obsessed with this product. it is perfect for my combo, texture prone skin!!! my face has looked so clear and moisturizer since using it!",positive
"this stuff changed my skin. i always had a few pimples here and there, bumpy skin all through my teens and twenties. since using this, my skin is clear!! i recommend to anyone struggling to clear their skin. i love waking up to fresh skin and i will keep using this product. i would like to add that my skin is on the sensitive side and this sometimes burns to put on, but i muscle through it because it keeps my skin clear.",positive
"i really wanted to like this product. it is a total miss for me. the cream is almost greasy and it does not absorb into your skin, therefore runs into your eyeballs and it burns so bad.",neutral
this is a really good night cream to moisturizer your skin but it does not have anything special that worth that price. i have used cheaper creams that work in the same way,positive
"i have been using this nightly for a week, and skin-transforming as the product claims on it is label is wholly incorrect in my experience. i love the packaging, it is glass and heavy. the cream itself is nice and thick with a lovely purple color and smell. it is just no better than a drugstore brand to me. in fact, this morning i woke up with my face feeling fairly dry. if you have dry skin like me, this will not be enough for you.",negative
"this product has witch hazel in it which is incredibly sensitizing and drying to my face. when i put this on it stinged so much. woke up to dry patches all over my t-zone where i applied it and not just over the blemish spots. if anything, it felt like i had pulled out all of the moisture from my healthy skin. if you have even remotely dry easily irritated skin as opposed to oily, you probably are not going to like this",negative
"i absolutely love this serum, i have super bad dry skin and i have only been using it for a few days and it is amazing! the only reason i did not give it stars is because it is so small and barely any product.",positive
"i received this product complimentary from facegym for review purposes. vitamin c is honestly such an underrated ingredient in skincare. this face serum is really effective and the texture is to die for. if you are looking to incorporate vitamin c into your skincare routine, i highly recommend you try this!",positive
"the pump is the worst. so, i do not like sunscreen. who does? i do not want my skin to be greasy or shiny. however, a mist is an easy way to apply. but, this pump is terrible. it is not really a mist, it is more like a spray. which does not apply evenly. i immediately poured the contents of this bottle into my urban decay setting spray and that was much better. it also kind of stings when applied, but switching the bottle helped. and it does kind of leaves a greasy glow and it feels greasy too. it is not that bad. i just wish they could improve the formula and the sprayer nozzle for sure is sub-par.",neutral
i found this products did not control oil or breakouts as well as another brand i tired. i also did not realize how small the product was. overall i thought it was just okay.,neutral
that is ok but is not amazing because it feels cool after used and clean and controls the oils a little bit but nothing that you cannot find an another mask more affordable but it is ok for a chill day,neutral
great product not so great for sensitive skin. i ended up returning this as after a week of use my skin began to get irritated immediately after applying it. i think it was the fragrance in this as all my other products are sephora clean.,neutral
"i love the ingredients and that it is unscented. the packaging is a beautiful blue with an easy to use pump system and has great weight to it. the cream itself hydrates well but does not provide the instant supple feel i enjoy from other creams. it reminds me a bit too much of nivea cream. by that i mean that it feels like it just sits on my skins surface, it is thick and almost sticky in consistency though eventually it does absorb into your skin. i personally would not choose to repurchase this product based on the consistency and i want to feel the hydration and the plumping effect immediately. i am received the product for free for testing purposes. those that are looking for a lightweight hydrating cream may enjoy this more.",neutral
"while this is perfectly fine, i did not like it enough to switch from my current nighttime hyaluronic acid. i think i just do not love runny stuff like this at night, and i do not want to do multiple steps.",neutral
i like that the bottle has three different creams in one which are supposed to work together the bottle looks very expensive and if good quality. i fell like i saw a difference in my skin right away but did not see any difference the rest of the time i was using it. one thing to note is that it does feel very think on your face so definitely not something for people with oily skin,neutral
"i was optimistic about this product because i have seen many youtubers advertise it. i tried it and it broke me out in the nd week of using it. absolutely horrible, and now i am trying to get my skin back to how it was before. it leaves you sticky and not anywhere near the clean feeling people rave about. i have oily prone skin, but surprisingly, not have dealt with pimples consistently until i used this product. it is been an ongoing battle since to repair the damage done. save your money and your skin from this atrocity of a skincare product.",negative
i love this product. i just bought another bottle and i have not even ran out of my first one. it really makes my skin look more alive. i like the smell and love the tingles because i know it is really doing something. for sure a keeper in my nighttime skin care routine.,positive
seems to work and feels like a primer which is nice because it is not oily and greasy.,positive
"i actually cannot comment much on the efficacy of this because between the consistency, the smell, and the fact that it causes a dull burn in my skin, i just do not like using it. other reviewers are singing its praises but i just never really want to reach for it.",neutral
"i was super excited to receive this product to test, but after using it for a little while i realized it is not my favorite. i have combination skin and my face felt oilier than normal throughout the day. the product feels light when you apply it but does not seem to absorb as well as other serums and sunscreens do. it also strangely started pilling after a couple weeks of use. i noticed some brightening and immediate light coverage of rednesspores which i appreciated. the photo i uploaded has slightly different lighting but i think this affect over time is apparent in it. if you are looking for a one stop shop product then i think this ones for you. however i probably would not purchase a bottle once the one i received for testing purposes runs out.",neutral
"omg i just tried this for the first time today and i am in love! it is an extremely gentle exfoliator that works so well! you know the videos you watch on ig that show someone do their skincare routine and then their face looks extremely smooth, clean, fresh, glasslike, etc? this product actually made my face look and feel that way. that is the best way i can describe it. i can already tell my foundation is going to on so much more smooth!!! my face does not feel tight either. i have tried hundreds of skincare products and honestly nothing has ever made my skin feel this nice, fresh, clean, and smooth!",positive
"bffr what does that spell? be freaking for real. smells good and looks great for about seconds, after that you notice no difference. gave me blackheads and broke me out on my forehead, do not waste your money.",negative
"did not like it since it caused me to break out. i have tried other similar products and they did not irritate my skin. had to return it. i really wanted this to work and help my sunspots. could not deal with the amount of breakouts to offset the possible benefits it supposedly promise. in exchange, i paid a little more for tatcha brighten serum. so far, so good. and no breakouts.",negative
"jai essaye ce tonique fois seulement. quand je me suis reveille le matin jai remarque que ma peau de mon visage etait tres luissant. moi jai une peau mixte et je lai essaye au mois de mars. je nai pas aime comment ca reste sur ma peau. them plus lete arrive a grand pas et ma peau a tendance a produire plus de sebum. donc jai fait un mauvais choix de choisir ce tonique. veuillez lire bien les ingredients avant votre achat. je recommande ce produit pour les peaux seches qui craquent, qui tiraillent. je dirais meme que ce produit est une essence et non un tonique. cest collant sur ma peau. donc cest pour ca que je le recommande pour les peaux seches. jaurais voulu aime tant ce produit car ca contient des aha.",neutral
this only lasted me days- and i did not use it absolutely everyday. so on average it is at one pump an application!!!! i did not see any difference in my skin. not worth the price sadly.,negative
waste of money. i could have used that money for food. smh,negative
"i received this product from yttp to test. i used it every morning for weeks using pump to cover my face. personally i will discontinue further usage and not purchase again because i do not like the finish on my skin. if you like snail products i think you would really like this one as an awesome vegan alternative! pros faded red marks, skin texture and quality looked good no negative changescons leaves a tacky finish on the skin and product causes pilling on face similar to snail products i have triedi do not wear foundation so i am not sure how it behaves with a layer of makeup on top. photo left is before my first usage, middle is after first usage of the product, right is weeks of usage. i am not wearing foundation or concealer in any of these photos.",neutral
"the best i can describe it is fermented rice smell hidden with fragrance- which also means it is not a clean beauty product by having added fragrance. the cream itself feels great, gel cushion that absorbs quickly and gives you a slight glow. great for natural skin days or with a setting powder laid on top. personally, i will not be buying it again given the smell is a turnoff and i am looking for clean products, but otherwise it is a great product!",neutral
"i am an experienced self-tanner and love iops drops and water but this oil is not doing it for me. tan came out splotchy but luckily was so light, despite being dark color, that you could barely tell. additionally i had to use the better part of a bottle to apply one coat, so definitely not cost effective either. i will stick with the drops and water.",negative
gets rid of blackheads and textured skin and scaring!!!,positive
"fav part of my skincare routine. smells amazing, leaves you looking like a glowing queen. looks incredible under makeup or without any at all. leaves you a healthy glow without looking greasy! a must try",positive
this definitely leaves your face red. i do not think it does much for shrinking pores or deep cleaning.,neutral
i was so excited to try a sample of this product only to never try it due to the smell! i thought i got perfume by mistake. if not a fan or sensitive skin do not recommend!!!,negative
"it is a good product overall, decent coverage and minimal irritation on sensitive skin.",positive
"i have used this product religiously for about weeks now and have not noticed even a tiny bit of difference. i even keep it in a beauty fridge so it is cool, and use it morning and night. cannot say it works in the slightest.",negative
i just got a new bottle with a skincare kit and now i realize that my original purchased bottle is not actually supposed to be a dark brown in the bottle..is it still safe to use?,neutral
"i have dry and oily skin. this did not work for me. if you have oily skin, but not really dry, it is best. this was not for me, but i think overall it is good.",neutral
this mask messed up my skin. it made my skin burn so mad and has left me with breakouts around my mouth and my forehead. not going to use again.,negative
it was an impulse buy. so i did nog expect much from it. however what i really did not expect was the glitter staying on the under eye area. i would not purchase them again. however they are a cute undereye treatment starter,neutral
"really drying. you can probably find a better cleanser. the only thing i really like about it is the amount of product in the tube, lasted me for at least months and i washed both at night and day.",neutral
"love this product, love the experience of applying it and it instantly feels soothing. one note- i guess i misread the directions because i had applied it around the eye, not just underneath, and i went cross-country skiing without sunglasses and i got burned on my brow bones on both eyes. so make sure to be extra careful with spf! as we should be anyways.",positive
"i really wanted to like this, and it really is not bad- but there is better. it is often hard to wash off, i end up with a greasy layer than i need to reach wash off with another cleanser, which i suppose is expected but it does leave a film over my eyes too. i am going to go back to the farmacy green clean- that one was amazing and i already purchased for when i finish this one. also it should come with a scooper- i do not want to keep putting my finger in there, so i repurposed the one i got from another cleansing balm.",negative
"needed multiple cleanses afterwards, did not do a great job.",negative
this in makeup remover does not remove mascara or eyeliner. i do not use waterproof eye makeup and i still have to use my clarins eye makeup remover. if you barely wear makeup and want a soft oil to remove it then this is the product. it is a complete waste for me since i always wear mascara. i have even tried using this twice followed by my ytp cleanser and i still have raccoon eyes,negative
"i did not hate it and did not love it. it smells great and it is fresh for the morning but i find my skin still needs a hint of moisture in the afternoon. i just think for the price, it should have been better. i am now using a boscia one from costco and works amazing with my combination skin.",neutral
"i like this product. this was the first retinol i had ever used in hindsight i probably should have starter slower. my skin purged horribly for about weeks... thank goodness it was during quarantine in the spring hehe! after the purging stage stopped, i started slow again and really enjoyed this product. i have used it for almost a year now and i do feel that it still causes the occasional dryness and redness on my skin but my acne has cleared up a lot and my skin feels great! i am still deciding if i want to repurchase this again or if i should try a different one and see if something is better!",positive
"while using the product, i saw very little differences to the under eye area. the pump stopped working and there is much product still inside. highly recommend to avoid this product!",negative
"really cute bottle design. the color is girly pink and it is like tasting forbidden fruit. great branding tactics. the serum itself is mediocre. it is smooth, moisturizing and absorbed really slow, when it absorbed? the skin felt dry. the serum did not last long. clinique moisture surge h auto-replenishing hydrator will do a better job without the adorable packaging.",negative
"this is a nice serum that does some effective moisturizing. i have been using it consistently since receiving it as a sample, and while it provides smooth hydration when and where applied, it has had only subtle impact on my fine lines and wrinkles. it did decrease them some, but that would be something to consider at its price point.",neutral
"took my a while to realize that this is what was giving me major blackheads between my brows. i have used oil cleansers forever without this issues. also since you wash it off, who would have thought that this would really make you break out? but after eliminating other products i realized this was the culprit. let me tell you i have never had such crazy congestion on my skin. so disappointed, sure, but really what a waste because now i will have to undo the damage done by a silly cleanser.",negative
i love this moisturizer! it reminds me of the tatcha water cream but a little bit heavier! this moisturizer sinks in so fast and does not make me oily at all. it keeps me hydrated throughout the day. i absolutely love this!!,positive
"i stumbled upon this company not too long ago and i love love all of their products, super affordable for really good ingredients. this product specifically did wonders on my skin. it cleared up so many dark spots i had and my face is so much smoother!",positive
"i had tried a small size of this before and loved it. a few other cleansing oilbalms later, i purchased the full size of this. i was super disappointed. it leaves a bit of a residue. when i tried to remove eye makeup, no matter how well i rinsed, a weird film would get into my eyes for a few minutes. for that reason alone, i will not repurchase this nor recommend it. on top of that, i felt like i was still finding traces of mascara or eyeliner. i found myself getting a cleaner result just using water on a makeup eraser, and ended up always having to essentially use my makeup eraser in the same way as if i had not even used this cleanser. double work? no thanks.",neutral
"it is not necessarily a drying cleanser, but my skin wants more hydration than this gives. it feels like it strips a little bit too much oil off the skin. i normally just use cetaphil or more gentle and hydrating cleansers that leave skin feeling nourished. this cleanser does not do that.",neutral
"sensitive skin in need of non drying, non oily, and non fragrant face wash for clear skin. look no further! pink cloud was everything i need and more. not only does it leave my skin feeling great, it is actually correcting what some previous washes did to my face. plus it is so joyous to use each day with it is color and packaging. highly reccomended.",positive
"love this product, the simplicity of this formula is what i enjoy the most. this cleanser really makes your face feel clean afterwards, i have sensitive skin and i have yet to break out from it. i also think that the price is a little expensive but honestly worth it once you try it. the only unpleasant aspect would be the smell but it is is not unbearable. totally able to handle it and the cleanser is just too good to not purchase!",positive
feeling like a glowing queen with this product. absolutely loveeee,positive
los resultados de este producto son inmediatos. hace ver la piel saludable.,positive
it leaves a slightly greasy feel but no fragrance which is good. it clogged my pores slightly. i love the dewy look it gave! i will use it up but i will probably not buy again,neutral
made my face flaky and dry.,negative
"honestly, i do not know if this is helping my skin. i am on week using the acne solutions system. i do like the feeling when i apply... it feels like its working somehow.",neutral
it is good that it does not leave a white cast but too greasy for my combination skin and it feels kind of heavy.,neutral
i love love love this exfoliant it is go gentle but very effective recommend!!,positive
"its okay. nothing special. smells good. has a very mild burn. but in all fairness, i just microdermed my face.",neutral
it is my first time using it and wow this feels amazing!!i saw some people saying it was sticky but i did not get that at all. it is super moisturizing and i have combination skin. and packaging is great just buy it and it lasts forever so that is is amazing it will not be used up in a month,positive
"i love this face wash. the frothiness makes a little go a long way. does not dry my skin out, but gets the job done. it lasts a long time too. one bottle lasts me over months and i use it twice a day!",positive
"i have been using this for a few weeks now and have not really noticed much of a difference. my undereyes remain dark and a little puffy. it does not irritate my dry and sensitive skin though, which is a plus!",neutral
"i have been using this toner for about years now, and i will not use any other toner. it is my holy grail toner. i have really sensitive skin and i find that most toners burn my skin, this one does not! it is very comforting like it states. i also actually really like the smell as well.",positive
"i noticed a softer appearance in my skin immediately immediately, however after about days of use and making no changes in my skincare, the results went away. since then i have used just so it is not wasted. i do experience with application of other products after applying this my skin tingles more than normal, but that is it. the packaging also broke on me after only weeks i realized after it broke the packaging is deceiving as the product is contained in a smaller container within the exterior packaging. i love tatcha so i am very disappointed this product has not changed anything after months of use, especially for such a steep price.",negative
"i got this product as a sample and have had it on my face for minutes. i do not know if it works, and to be honest i do not care if it works because it smells so bad! this could make me look again and i would still not purchase the full size. that is how bad it smells.",negative
"this cleanser smells weird, leaves a greasy cast on your skin, and barely removes my makeup. i bought this to use for double cleansing but was surprised by how disappointing it was. i did not enjoy the texture of the product and found it hard to squeeze a little bit out from the tube even from the very first use. i used this cleanser for about two weeks before giving up. i do not recommend it. there is better cleansers out there.",negative
"the scent on this is so strong that, within minutes, i had to wash it off because i could not fall asleep smelling the irritating scent. it is not a good scent- it is a strong rose smell that calls to mind octogenarians at dennys early bird hour. if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to avoid this.",negative
"i am in love with this product. i have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin. my face has a negative reaction to at least of products that i try but when i spray this on my skin, i can feel the moisture soaking in. it has an unreal cooling effect whenever i am experiencing inflammation, irritation or a flare up. i will definitely repurchase again. i will say though, the scent is a little off took a star off for this reason. might just be me, but i have started holding my breath whileafter spraying this. regardless, if you have sensitive skin which gets irritated over almost anything, this was made for you.",positive
"i really love this brand, but this product was just meh for me. the consistency of the product is great, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, perfect for am. i did not see any difference in firmness and i did not feel like my skin was super hydrated either. i actually think i have more visible fine lines after switching to this eye cream from the tatcha one. i just finished this and i have ordered the other yttp eye cream to try it out because i am still looking for a less expensive alternative to tatcha which i love but the price is a lot for me right now. if you are a skincare beginner or maybe someone in their teens or very early s i am and this is not enough then this might be a good option for you. the best word i can use to describe this product is basic.",neutral
"cleanser is alright, nothing special in my opinion. the smell is sooo overpowering, you can taste the the fragrance while washing your face, just awful. no reactions on my sensitive skin, but beware.",neutral
my favorite the ordinary product hands down! it leaves my skin moisturized and soft. i use it in the mornings after my toner and before a moisturizer with spf.,positive
i am so sad they discontinued the old formula. this new formula is so disappointing and cannot even be compared to what used to be. bring back the old formula!,negative
"the product applies easily and looks great at first. you just have to make sure not to put too much. throughout the day, it starts to get flaky on my face. this made me paranoid and i felt i had to check my face every few hours to make sure it did not look like a flaky mess. in my case, i am better off just not using it.",neutral
"loved this compared to the dewy purple bottle of this brand. i have really dry skin but this works for my day or night. it is supposed to be the one that can be used for less dry skin, again, when compared to their other big name moisturizer but for someone who has that super dry skin, this works great. it is lightweight but absorbs really really well into my skin- which sometimes, a lighter moisturizer that absorbs really well works better than a thickheavy moisturizer that just sits on your skin. i would buy this again. however, it is expensive there are equally as good moisturizers out there for less price just saying!",positive
"i started this about months ago when completely revamping my skincare routine with the ordinary products. consistency wise, it is an oil and the smell is unoffending at least to me. if you do not store it properly or you keep one bottle for months like i did, it might start to have a strong smell. at that point i would say get a new bottle. i have to say, as an oily lady i was very hesitant to try skin oil. every time i thought about slathering an oil on my face i had images of oil spills in the ocean, a greasy pole and oil dripping off of a pizza. i am happy to report that there was no such oil disaster after using this product. in fact, i will very reluctantly call this product a holy grail type. my skin did not suffer any breakouts from the added oil and it looks very supple and is so unbelievably soft. at first i attributed this to buffet, but even after my bottle of buffet finished and i continued on with my routine, my skin kept getting softer and more supple so i will give credit to this oil. at night this is my last step or second to last step if i choose to use a sleeping mask. for the price and effectiveness, you cannot go wrong.",positive
yep... i understand the hype around this product gifted by innbeauty project!! seriously. this is such a fun product and you cannot beat the packaging. it feels amazing on my skin. not sticky. and i have been using it daily with no skin irritation. definitely a fan!,positive
"tried this three times, followed the directions to a tee, and each time i used this mask, i woke up to pimples the following morning. i have dry, somewhat sensitive skin, so i was hoping this would hydrate and give me some radiance, but other than breaking me out, it did not do a thing. i looked up the ingredients, and there are several pore-clogging ingredients in this. be careful if you are prone to breakouts andor have sensitive skin.",negative
this is a fantastic product. i have been trouble with maskne because it has been so hot and humid while teaching in a mask all day. this is just the product i needed to unclog pores at the end of a day. it is gentle while packing a punch.,positive
"i was terribly sleep deprived after having my baby and hated the way my eyes looked, this product really did wonders for me and i am already going through my second bottle. you can also feel how it tightens all the eye area to prevent wrinkles. since i have very dry skin i like to use an eye cream as well on top of it.",positive
"bought this because my usual favourite cleanser was out of stock youth to the people, and i have enjoyed other herbivore products so gave it a try. super gentle, a little goes a long way and my skin is not dry or tight after using! i use as second cleanse in my double cleanse routine after oil cleansing. love the glass packaging, lockable pump and herbivores usual commitment to clean, quality ingredients. price is excellent especially since you need so little.",positive
my goal was to remove dark marks in the simplest way possible i would not recommend if you do not have time to use other products like sunscreen every day do not buy.,negative
"i received this product free for testing purposes only. i love how hydrating this product is. it does not feel oily on the skin! however, i did not notice any significant changes to firmness or youthfulness.",neutral
"super soothing, great consistency leaves skin nourished and glowing.",positive
"unfortunately, this did not make any noticeable difference in my uneven skin tone after using for several weeks.",negative
"it smells horrible!! it worked okay, but not great. i just could not get past the smell. i threw it out. do not waste your money!! if i could give it zero stars i would.",negative
i was skeptical using these at first but they really do work. i used them on my slightly noticeable forehead lines and they definitely looked less prominent in the morning. this is a product i would keep purchasing.,positive
i am just loving the results after using this product from past few weeks. it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day and definitely gives a glow. a must have in your routine,positive
"was looking for a really good reparative moisturizer and this was not a good fit. my skin is quite dry in winter, but with it being summer i was so surprised when i could not put liquid foundation on without my skin looking scaly underneath and peeling. i only used it twice a day for days and it is really done a number on my skin. my cheeks are still rough and i stopped using it days ago. very disappointed!",negative
does it work as sunscreen? yes. does it feel good applying and during wear? absolutely not. it feels so much like silicone i cannot help but hate it. it reminds me a bit too much of the pore filling primer texture. it leaves my skin feeling oily even though it is not.,negative
kind of upset that i spent so much on this product. such a small portion and it did absolutely nothing for my redness. even with my regular foundation over top. i was expecting a lot more based on such great reviews.,negative
"love this. i have been using this product for more than years! no fragrance, gentle and leaves your skin feeling so clean! non irritating. my year old daughter tried it and loves it as well. only drawback is its price, quite pricey but a small amount goes a long way.",positive
worked for me. but i stopped noticing results after sometime,neutral
i got a sample of this product and i am not a fan this moisturizer feels really thick and i still had dry patches around my nose,negative
i received this product for free from influenster for review but this opinion is that of my own. i was so excited to try this serum but unfortunately it breaks me out really badly. i have tried and tried to make it work but again and again it covers my face with tiny white heads. i believe this product is meant to compete with good genes by sunday riley which does not break me out. if you do not have super acne prone skin this might be a great product for you but unfortunately i will not continue to use it and will not repurchase it.,neutral
this formula was too harsh for my skin. i added- pumps like the bottle said as part of my normal skincare. i used sunscreen. it left my skin red and raw.,negative
refreshing but basic. super watery but good for those hot months.,neutral
"i was a little disappointed in this. the claim is that this is good for people with acne prone and oily skin. my skin is very oily and i have blackheads. i get occasional jawline hormonal acne but it is usually one or two blemishes a month. no big deal. i have been doing a step regimine for months now and wanted to try this. i was using the benton aloe propolis gel as a moisturizer. now, the watermelon moisturizer feels wonderful and gives a very nice dewy look. the ingredients list is wonderful...or so i think. but a week after using it, i have small pimples and closed comodones all over my forehead. i have not had a pimple on my forehead in over a decade, since my teenage acne began. i have read about your skin purging, but i have never had something like this happen before. i exfoliate physically twice a week and once i do a gentle enzyme exfoliation. i have no idea why else this could be happening other than this moisturizer as nothing else in my routine has changed.",neutral
"i loved this serum. i got it as part of the set and i really wanted to buy the full size of most products. this one i decided it was too much, i have other serums that are more affordable, and work just as well. that being said, the scent might not be everyone is cup of tea, but i loveeee it. the moisturizer smell very similar and i did buy the full size of that, so i can go to sleep with that scent on me!",positive
"used this product once, and made my forehead breakout with small red bumps!!! have not had acne on my forehead since early high school, so it is incredibly stressful to see this in my twenties! would not recommend!",negative
i do not know what the hype is about. did not do anything for my skin,negative
it really did nothing for me. it is extremely light weight. i did not like it on very hot days in the summer where i just needed a little moisturizer but i definitely will not buy it again.,negative
"i bought this product after hearing some excellent things about it. after using it for nights i started noticing new breakouts in areas of my face. i thought it was just the product purging my skin, except these breakouts were located in areas of my face where i have never broken out before. the breakouts resolved on their own after i stopped using the product. wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it was not for me.",negative
"this is not a good toner. ingredients are not good at all even if its a clean product. one of the first is alcohol denat wich is very drying and bad for sensitive and acne prone skin. the perfuming of this is intense and again not good for acne or sensitive skin alot of essentials oils wich is natural but as bad as perfume. on top of that, there is allergen limonene,citronellol e.c.t that can cause bad skin reaction and should be in no skincare. there is better options in sephora right now...",negative
received complimentary by murad! i am loving this stuff! i am going on and am deff noticing the difference in my skin lately! i wanted to try a retinol for everyday without it being to harsh and this does just that! also seems to calmdown any hormonal acne!,positive
does not because sensitivity that is good. however not really seeing much change in brightness or whiteness in my teeth.,neutral
"this cleanser is really strange. i received it as my birthday gift. it is very thick and once you mix it with water and apply it and rinse it off, it leaves some kind of film on your skin. i do not wear makeup so the only thing this product had to go though was my daily moisturizer no other serums or anything. my face did not feel clean even after massaging the product thoroughly for two minutes or so. however the fragrance in this product is horrible. i do not understand why there has to be a fragrance added to skin care hello irritation! in the first place and let alone a product that washes off your face. the smell is very syntheticartificial and very strong. how is this product labeled clean at sephora when the ingredients are clearly not clean?!",negative
"great product in terms of the even tan. really wanted this to work on my face but unfortunately it broke me out so bad. if you are even mildly sensitive to breakouts, stay away from this on your face. i will continue to use on my legs.",neutral
"gifted by farmacy. omg this overnight mask is amazing!!! it is about time farmacy came out with this!! been waiting for this mask from them. it is so hydrating. my skin wakes up and instantly feels firm, hydrated and looks more plump!",neutral
"i recieved the inkey list pha gentle exfoliating toner as a free sample. i have only tried it once, but when i did, my skin felt dry and irritated. i see a lot of good reviews, but this one is not for me.",neutral

the first beauty product i have ever used where i noticed an immediate difference in pore size. leaves my face a little sticky so i only use it at night,positive
"my skin is brown and i can guarantee you that this does not leave a white cast. it is super moisturizing and smells lovely. however, this product claims to have an environmentally friendly packaging, but it feels quite heavy on the plastic part. it is refillable, but the recharge contains just as much plastic as a brand new lotion container. i probably will not repurchase. but do give it a shot if you want to try it! and, bonus, it is coral reef friendly.",neutral
"got this in a ml size using my beauty insider points and just finished the tube. the product is pleasant to use with a pleasant smell and an interesting texture that is gel-like and also a little greasy, but not necessarily in a negative way. i found myself using this on a weekly-ish basis just to add something different and fun to my morning routine, but probably would not reach for this on a daily. it is rather expensive for what it is and does, and does not really justify the price. did not see any benefits using this, so probably would not purchase it for myself, but it could make a nice pick-me-up spa-like gift for someone else.",neutral
i have been using this product for a about two weeks and have been really enjoying it so far!! i needed something with lactic acid and this has been the perfect fit in my routine!! it has really helped with the texture i have in the winter months.,positive
i love fresh products but this one not so much. i have used it twice and both times my face felt super dry after. i have combination skin and very sensitive. this cleanser was very irritating i would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.,negative
"this is a nice moisturizer with a good texture. i bought to use as a daily spf for under my make up and it. it unfortunately is quite shiny and made me break out quite a bit, especially under my mask which had not been a big problem before. it also has a much stronger smell than i anticipated. could be a a good fit for someone, just not for me.",neutral
love the price point but it left a film over my skin and eyes and i just did not enjoy the experience. the fulvic acid face wash is way better and i just use that twice at night now!,negative
"bought the mini size to use on a flight to help keep my skin moisturized. first, the product does not smell good, not sure if i got a bad batch or if that is just how it smells. my skin did not seem to absorb the product and my forehead honestly seemed drier. i have drier skin so i would not recommend if you do as well.",neutral
"i hate the smell of this product, smells like a mans perfume or mens aftershave. disappointed that they changed the product and did so for the worse. i really, really liked the previous version of the cream it was not cell energy. i am barely using this one as i find the smell overwhelming, long lasting and offensive, which is quite frustrating given its price.",negative
i use this morning and night. i love the mild exfoliation it provides. it is extremely gentle. i have been using this with the water cream for a year and i adore it. it gives a very nice glow.,positive
"after using this product once a week for weeks, i can definitely say that it is immensely hydrating! i use prescription acne creams x-x a week and it can tends to leave my skin feeling incredibly dry and tight. this mask really helped fixing that. also, does not because breakouts in my case.",positive
this product gave me chemical burns extremely damaged my skin on my eyes after only uses.,negative
"well i have done it, i think i found my favorite skin care item. i cannot imagine being without this. i bought it during the spring sale and use it twice a day i do not find the need to use a moisturizer on top of it. this provides the moisture my face needs in the springsummer in the pnw. it does feel oily at first, but it absorbs. the smell is like other fresh rose products. i love it!",positive
absolutely love this serum!! my skin is a bit dry and also very sensitive and this has been amazing for it! it is a very lightweight serum and it makes my skin feel immediately more hydrated. my skin feels so smooth afterwards and it makes my makeup go on super easily and look great! the top is a pump which i love so much more than dropper tops because it makes it much easier to apply. it has such a light scent so if you do not like heavily scented skincare products then this is perfect for you! overall i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a serum that makes your skin feel almost instantly more hydrated!! i did receive this product as a free sample and this is my honest opinion from using it!,positive
at first i thought this product was helping me but it really did not.it did not do anything.none of my acne scars faded even after using this how they recommend for months.not worth your money.but every skin type is different so maybe start with the mini size just to see if it helps.use that for a month and if it works buy the full size one.off with the mini just to see if it works h,neutral
"i had such a crazy reaction to this product. it gave me literal chemical burns and made my entire face break out like crazy!! i have never struggled with acne before using this product, and after only uses my skin is wrecked. very upset.!",negative
i absolutely loved the original formal for this moisturizer and was honestly so bummed when i found out they changed the formula. it took me a long time to build up the courage to try the new formula and it kind of hated it. the smell is really weird and it is not as hydrating as the old formula. i contributed this moisturizer to also helping keep my skin from breaking out but i feel like this new formula maybe contributing to my breakouts now. please go back to the old formula!!,negative
there is not a single hint of rose to this. it smells straight up like pickle juice. it does make my skin feel nice but i bought it expecting rose so prob will not repurchase.,neutral
"spread nicely and feels very moisturizing without being greasy. however the smell is awful, like rancid oils. love drunk elephants but cannot get over this smell",negative
"i like the dewy look, but this cream has a matte finish. nice consistency but very drying!!",neutral
"i have tried most of the products in this line and have loved them all. this product works well for covering redness. however the capdropper for the packaging is not done well. it constantly leaks, even if left alone and upright. i have lost more than of the product because it is leaking out of the cap. i attached photos to give you an idea of what it looks like. i cleaned off the cap less than hours prior and it has been sitting upright in my beauty organizer it has not been tilted over or anything. it is constant. i will not be repurchasing this product until the packaging is addressed because i feel like i am just wasting money watching the product drip down the sides. i would recommend the other tiger grass that comes in a jar to help redness until this is addressed.",neutral
"i unfortunately received this product late and am unable to do a full week use review, but i did use this product consistently for one week. although it is small, i did definitely notice a difference in the darkness of my under eyes. i am using this product at a point where i am really busy and not getting as much sleep, so i was able to notice the difference a lot more! i also do think i experienced a little more hydration under my eyes. the product itself is a nice consistency, applies smoothly, does not have any sort of weird feeling after application. i think this is overall a good product and i am excited to see how things look in another week!",positive
"this was awful! it. i heard the texture was a bit weird, but that did not really bother me. i did not like this because it was so hard to get out of the bottle, and it barely removed anything!",negative
do not use if you have acne prone skin!! made me breakout within only a few hours of use.,negative
"i absolutely love this masque. it really helps with my acne, acne scars and oiliness. i use it every- days with the blemish formula and it does wonders",positive
"not only did this not really change my skin enough to justify the high price point, but i really hated working with it. the consistency is very watery, so when squirting it out of the bottle it would not land nicely on my face. it would squirt everywhere but my face and product would be wasted. so then i tried squirting on my fingers. just as bad because the consistency was so thin, it would seep into the cracks between my fingers and become pretty messy. i finally resulted to applying it to my palms, but this made it difficult to apply then to my face, in addition to all the wasted product because after rubbing my palms together, most stayed on my palms instead of transferring to my face. overall an application nightmare lol. i also did not like how sticky my face felt afterward... i would have to wait several minutes before applying my moisturizer on top, and even after that my face still felt sticky. just really not worth the high price tag for me!",negative
"i have received this for testing purposes and that will not change my opinion. i loved the idea of this product but unfortunately it did not work for me. i have combination and sensitive skin at the same time, my skin broke out after every use. i used it according to the instructions but unfortunately it did not work for me. i guess it could have been too strong for my skin type. i had such high hopes for this product.",neutral
overrated. it is more like a light sheen liquid and no it is not worth it.. do not always believe those gurus because they are getting paid to sell you the products that does not even live it to the hype. save your coins.,neutral
best moisturizer feels very light weight works great for all day.,positive
i bought the ml size. the scent is pleasant. i have been using to drops depending on how much hydration my skin needs. i would repurchase this toner.,positive
did they add something different to it?? i used to use this oil about a year ago n it worked great. just recently bought it again it broke me out! clogged up my pores and caused so much texture! n not to mention my face was so itchy after the second day? probably from my pores getting irritated n clogging up.,negative
great results! definitely will recommend this skin product.,positive
"i like this product a lot. i would not say i love it, but i like it enough to possibly purchase more in the future. the smell is very botanical, which i do not mind, and i like that is does not have a greasy feel on your skin.",positive
did not like this. it did nothing. and was difficult to blend. do not recommend!,negative
"i went with this serum after reading the raving reviews, expecting it to live up to the hype and the cost. i used it religiously morning and night for almost two months and i have not noticed the promised results. in fact, i have noticed almost no results, merely the area more hydrated and slightly brighter for a few hours after using. not a lasting effect.the worst part, though, is that i ran out of it very quickly and from one day to the next. the packaging is very misleading because it does not contain as much product as it looks. it is not like almost every other product that you can tell you are about to run out of, it just did not pump anymore one day and when i opened it, there was in fact nothing left.for the price of this cream and the very disappointing result i got, i do not think i will be buying it again.",negative

my favorite product from the ordinary. this has helped even out my skin tone and get rid of dull skin. my pores are less visible and less clogged.,positive
"i went from using a spray tan booth, to coola spray tan. coola is quite expensive so i wanted to try this one. it was okay, i am fairly light skin tone and i did not find it did much for me. i did not find it that sticky, nor did i mind the smell. but i do prefer the results with the coola spray over this one. that said, i also did not return this one. i will keep it as a back up as it does work a bit.",neutral
"i like that these are affordable and seem to be working on my sensitive skin. they have a scent that i do not particularly enjoy, but it fades quickly.",positive

"i just received this product today and used it for the first time after my shower. i was skeptical at first, but it absorbed into my skin super nicely and made me feel really soft. it smells nice and am excited to continue to use it!",positive
"this was a lifesaver for me. as a makeup novice, there are so many different products out there that i often find myself becoming overwhelmed and not knowing what to buy for what purposes that also cover xyz, and ect...you get it. it cosmetics your skin but better cc cream oil-free matte with spf was the answer to my confusion. i received this free sample from it cosmetics and after using it for the first time, i noticed that my skin still looked good several hours after. not only did this make my skin looks flawless who has pores? not this girl d buuuut...my combination skin did not even make an appearance! no more shiny forehead for me! and another thing, i am still not used to wearing makeup for a long time because i can usually feel the heaviness from all the other products i put on, except for this one. it is so lightweight yet so powerful! the only thing i did not really see a difference in was the spf protection. i usually wear sunscreen anyways so this did not make much of a difference for me. it sure is nice to have the extra protection though! my biggest surprise was just how much a little did for me! two pumps and you are done- so you will be able to use this for a while.overall, if you are going to invest in a good, quality foundation, it cosmetics your skin but better cc cream oil-free matte with spf is the answer. like my mother says, those who buy for quality once, do not buy again or at least, not for a loooong time. once my sample is up, i know what foundation i am coming back for.",positive

i received it as a campaign from topbox. i love this brand and i use a lot of products from this brand. i am glad i have the opportunity to do it. this night cream does help to brighten and smooth my skin. the texture is creamy but not too much for summer. the smell is so good. freeproducts,positive
it is okay. i do not get the hype. glamglow works way better to clean my pores. i would not repurchase.,negative
"this is not made for oily skin. it is a great reapplication for sunscreen but by the end of the day, your face feels so oily and heavy",negative
i really wanted to like this product but it pills up on your face and you have white clumps everywhere. it is better to use before bed so you can wash it off in the morning but you cannot wear it out of the house or under makeup unless you want clumps everywhere.,neutral

"i never had a problem with breakouts, but the reason i purchased this is because i heard how good salicylic acid is for your skin and i wanted to tame my oily skin. this product has made me break out more than i ever have and the consistency is really tacky and weird. i would not recommend this at all and i am going to stop using it.",negative
amazing for shrinking pores and mask acne!! does not leave a residue and skin does not feel tight after like other toners! would recommend if you have acne and oily skin! cannot say enough good things!,positive
"for cad, acne should be gone the next day. it still takes multiple uses and days for it to go. you are honestly better off trying a salicylic acid from the drug store that too at half the price. plus, it burns a lot and the bottle is awfully tiny. i would not recommend this, but especially for someone with sensitive skin.",neutral
smells nice- very small particles for exfoliating so felt gentle- warming sensations- however that is when the good stuff ends. tastes really bad if it gets in your mouth and made me break out very shortly after using it.,negative

i was expecting to be blow away by this serum given the price tag. been using for weeks now and i am underwhelmed by the results or lack thereof. it adds moisture and brightens your skin but nothing dramatic.,negative
i wanted to love this as it is expensive. it leaves a sticky residue on my face all day and caused my forehead to break out with itchy red bumps. i stopped using it for a week and gave it another try. i had the same reaction immediately. i will be returning.,negative

i got this in hopes to help lighten and even my skin tones. i used it for months before i gave up. i saw no difference using this product. did not work for me at all.,negative
"i started using this product because i just started a retinol and needed a little something extra than the water cream which i love. unfortunately, this is not it. while it feels luxurious and smells great, once applied it just sits on the top of your skin. i can never get it to fully absorb, even when i am not layering products. would not recommend.",negative
"expensive for a small bottle. no irritation, no stripping but nothing special",neutral
"if you are wondering why this is making your skin dry or peel, it is because you miiight be using too much product. i literally have only been applying exactly a pea-sized amount and only apply on my t-zonemiddle of the forehead and area around my nose where most of my pores are visible and then follow it up with b-hyra serum. you do not need to apply this to your entire face or to areas you do not have problems with at all. i put this on once everyday at nighttime after a good shower and have not had any problems. you want to be able to wear it daily to make the product work faster. this is definitely a holy grail for me! no pores, less redness, no breakouts!!",positive
"i have normal skin and this did not moisturize my face enough. unlike other moisturizers i have used, my face soaks up this one completely even when i use a generous amount, and i feel like i did not put anything on my face at all. it literally feels like i patted my face dry.but i will give credit where it is due. it is illuminatingradiant and it does give some sort of smoothing effect. i do not think this worked as a hydrator for me though. maybe it would work better on someone else.",neutral
i thought this was a pretty good serum. it is a good texture for me and keeps me moisturized without being too shiny for me. i also really like the smell.,neutral

i cannot say too much about this i have only used it once but i have to say it has a very strong smell of thyme which is a bit off putting but i used a little and could not really smell it while it was on my face. i will give it more time but i do appreciate the cleaner and vegan ingredients,neutral
"i was really looking forward to trying this cleanser. i like a few products from this brand and reviews for this cleanser were good. this product is very fragranced, my skin is sensitive to fragrance and with this face wash i got a bit of an irritation. really wanted to love this, but heavily fragrancedirritating. when i looked at the ingredients list i was surprised to find fragrance in the middle of the list as typically it is last or one of the last items on most skin care items.",negative
i have gotten reintroduced to this line and also to the habit of using a toner with my skin care routine after a few years recently. i never thought it was important to use a toner because i thought it was a waste of time and money but i honestly think this is all well worth both. i have spent a lot on products especially dr. dennis gross aha facial pads which i felt did not do much for me but i can say within a few weeks of using this my skin has been clear and glowing. i usually have a few break outs every once in awhile but this has kept it at bay. i have also cut down on other products i have used before which has saved me some money and we all know we get carried away at sephora when it comes to a new product we think will bring us a miracle. a little goes a long way i will definitely keep this in my routine as a staple for a long time!,positive
"i got this in a sample... the day after i used it, i noticed a little peeling around my chin, and it eventually worked its way all around my face and neck wherever i had put the product. this is normal, i have heard, but unless you plan on not seeing anyone for a week or using moisturizer every hrs to mask the dry, dead, peeling skin all over your face and neck, i would not reccommend this. on the up side, after the peeling was done, my face looked bright and glowy. even so, i would not spend my money on buying this.",neutral
"amazing mask, it has changed my skin. my skin is now so smooth and i am having less breakouts and have barely need foundation anymore. i am not sure why all the complaints about the smell, it works, so i am not sure how the smell is such an issue? buy it do not think twice. now buying a second jar and looking into the lapis oil as well. so happy i found this brand.",positive
the clarins double eye serum went on pretty smooth and i did not feel super oily afterwards.,neutral
this product dried the heck out of my face probably after washes. i have combo skin and this was not good for my face. also the smell is very fake.,negative
"nope. i have used a fair bit of sunless tanner over the years and this is worse than drugstore tanners as far as orange tone and blotchiness. not to mention that, as you try to rub it in, the gold shimmer what, why? in it clumps up on your skin. that seems to be a part of the blotchiness for me, so a bit irritating since this seems to be such a popular brand! that said, thinned out with regular lotion might make it work.",negative
this is the best cleansing balm i have tried. i got the sample and i am going back to buy the full size today. so good you honestly do not need to double cleanse. i am a master esthetician and it is better than what i carry professionally.,positive

taken for two months and notice zero difference. they taste fine. will not be buying again,neutral
i bought this in a kit to try out and i love how it feels very vey nice on the face but it does pill with makeup on. the only way this will work is just this product by it self on your skin for that just stars because i wear makeup almost everyday so i will rarely use it. but if you are not a makeup wearer you might love it.,negative
really wanted to like this product after reading such great reviews and spending so much on it. i am at that age where i still have acne but starting to see signs of aging. started to use this and after a couple days my face broke out. stopped using for a while and focused on clearing up my acne. once that got a little better i tried this moisturizer again and the next night i noticed blackheads started to show up. i have given it a fair try. now i just use it on my neck since i cannot break out there. now i am still on the hunt for a good night moisturizer that is good for my acne prone skin.,negative
it did not work! made me break out and it smells awful.,negative
"this serum is the only thing that has worked for my breakouts and makes my skin feel less oily under makeup, it is pricey but it is worth it!! i am still on the same bottle i purchased few months back, and i mainly use it as spot treatment. make sure you use sunscreen though as it contains ingredients that will make your skin sensitive to the sun",positive
this stuff is amazing!! it does smell a bit like ganja but that fades right away. i live in michigan where it was just- out for a week. my skin was dry and breaking out like crazy. then this magic potion came and within a couple of days my skin is a smooth as a babys bottom,positive
"i am obsessed with this stuff!!! it smells soooooo good...ever since the first time i used this moisturizer it was love at st smell lol for real though, on days that i am not wearing any makeup, i will put this stuff on multiple times throughout the day just to smell it some more. another thing, besides the yummy smell, it spreads so easily, a little goes a long way and it dries to a powder finish which i love because i will put a little of this stuff on over my murad skin perfecting lotion to get a little more of a matte look and reduce some shine and it works great and makes my skin look really nice...i highly suggest this stuff!!! be careful though you could become addicted like me ha ha",positive
"so this product definitely gives you a glow especially once you top it off with your moisturizer but is it worth? ehh maybe more like. if i am paying for a serum i better see results in a week lol. it did help fade some dark marks along with another product i was using. also your skin may purge when first starting this,i was using this product and then went about a month of not using it so once i started it back up i had three big pimples on my face that eventually went away",neutral
a very sticky formula! left my face looking sweaty or greasy. will not be using this product.,neutral

"definitely not for dark skin. it looked as if i put grease on my face. it accentuates every single pores and gave me terrible white heads and a slight rash all over my face. someone else wrote the same where the moisturizer does not go into your skin. it just lays on top and makes your skin excessively oily, well only until the rash develops",negative

i do notice quite the difference in my skin after a week with my pores being smaller and my skin just seeming smoother. however i am doing this for the long run so the real results will be in a few years. also i scooped out an imbedded hair like fiber from the cream and it grossed me out i do not think it was a hair because it stretched a little bit but i have no idea because it was in the moisturizer for a while i am guessing. i tried to take a picture of it but it was thin on the end of my finger.,positive

"i think aesthetically this is the cutest cleanser i have purchased, nothing wrong with the pump so far, love the heaviness of the glass packaging and the scent itself is quite mild in comparison to some other cleansers. however, i notice that the only difference between this cleanser and the brand vanicreams gentle cleanser is the price, packaging and pigment of the cleanser, other than that the formula is exactly the same. vanicream is i believe at any drug store and is such an effective cleanser with minimal packaging and no fragrance that it has beat out my- cleansers over the past few months. i do not mention vanicream to deter from herbivore, just noting the formulas are nearly identical, and that i prefer other cleansers to herbivores purely based on cheaper price and effective cleansing abilities. if you are looking to splurge on cleansers, have a pink minimalist aesthetic or try something new this is a great choice- just not one i would repurchase. best of luck.",neutral
"i was excited to try this after all the positive reviews. however, i have tried this product on and off and everytime i break out horribly. i usually do not react badly to new products and would not consider my skin thaaat sensitive. i have read comments that it made others break out so i know i am not alone. disappointing this was not hg for me.",negative
the first time i used this product i broke out with the biggest most painful zit ever on my upper lip. then more zits appeared the next day. i immediately stopped using- i have not had zits in years... this was a nightmare product for me. tried again a few weeks later as i did not want to waste this stuff it is expensive and i broke out yet again. i am done. that i have,negative

"love this eye cream! i had never been impressed with an eye cream before trying this one...i kind of thought they were scams to be honest? i had never used one that felt like anything other than an extra-thick moisturizer. but this one has changed my opinion completely!when yttp sent this to me, i laughed when i opened the box--it is tiny! but like most of their products, a little goes a long way. i noticed a difference in puffiness the very first night after using this, and it just got better every night after. i finally looked refreshed, you all!the thing that i run into with yttp products is that they are almost too good? what ends up happening is that i hit diminishing returns really quickly. after a week and a half of using this eye cream every night, i found that using it every night started making my eye area almost too hydrated is that even possible? basically where it felt like i did not need the cream because my skin was already good. i have never experienced skin congestion with any of their products, but i was a bit paranoid that i would end up with buildup if i kept using it every single night. so i now use it every- nights for maintenance. i feel like this is a terrible business model for yttp, but awesome for me because the product lasts a long time, despite the comically tiny container!anyway, i am impressed. i will reorder this forever, unless this jar does truly last forever as it seems to be doing at the moment...",positive
jury is still out. this is a unique product and the concept is great. i used it two days in a row and the actual application was amazing. it was really refreshing and absorbed well. my skin felt hydrated and it did not feel sticky or feel heavy on the skin. on the third day though i had the most horrendous dry skin and a few new acne marks. this was the only thing i changed in my routine. so i am sorry this probably is not very helpful but i think it is worth trying for yourself.,neutral
"i got this as a sample and was really excited to use it, but like some of the other reviewers mentioned, this leaves an uncomfortable film on your skin. it goes on smooth and creamy, but that is where the good ends. i immediately washed it off with another cleanser. it felt squeakynails on chalkboard uncomfortableness.",negative
"yes, sometimes a dot or two does not workstick properly but these are the best acne dots on the market. the mighty patch ones are trash in comparison",positive
i cannot give a true review which is sad. it feels amazing and can see that it will give a smoother appearance under makeup but the scent is so strong i have had to wash my face twice and still have a migraine from wearing it my face did feel wonderful after but i cannot review the long term benefits. if you are sensitive to smell stay away but if you are fine with scents i believe it would be worth it.,neutral
an average cleanser. however for the price i could have not gotten a better option.,neutral
"veryyyy greasy finish. i have combination skin and it would take about a minute or to fully absorb into the dry parts of skin, and would take about minutes to absorb into the oily parts of my skin and still leave me looking greasy. it also pills if you use anything under it even a lightweight serum or a toner.",negative
really like this on my skin! hydrating and good for dry skin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
feels dated. strong floral scent. oily and thick application. i felt like i was using my grandmothers face lotion. after using for a week i had clogged pores and scattered whiteheads. definitely not impressed and would not buy for the price. much better products are out there in this price point.,negative
"like the mask, i really wanted to like this product- the smell is amazing! however, it is not hydrating. in fact, shortly after spraying my face with it, my face somehow felt dry after it settled. and i do not even have dry skin- i am combo with some dehydration issues, but not full-on dry! had to return it, i did not even have it for a full day.",negative
"decent toner for people with oilyacne prone skin, but it does smell like actual dog pee. not like jasmine or green tea. maybe it is the witch hazel? it is pretty meh compared to what i was expecting.",neutral
"i have used a few other sunscreens since i have tried this one and i have yet to find one that fits my routine as well. it is wonderful under makeup has the same texture as the smashbox photo finish primer or by itself. as long as i give it a few minutes to absorb i do not have issues with pilling when i put something on top of it. as a redhead with fair skin, i have tried so many sunscreens in my life and this one is absolutely the stand out when it comes to facial sunscreen.",positive
i think this is great. i have normaldry skin so i find this works best for me more like a spot treatment or put on certain areas of my face rather than all over because it can be slightly drying. if i put this on a blemish it helps heal it so fast! i had cystic acne like bumps and this helped it clear up in a day or two. it is very nice!,positive
the snell is unbearable. i do not even want to use it after first use. most of my product are unscented so this was way too strong-i do not mind pleasant scented product-this one is not one of those! what a waste of money.,negative
"sometimes this product works, sometimes it does not. if it is a small blemish, it will work but not for the big nasty ones. i think the most it does for the big ones is make it a bit smaller. but i do not know, like i said hit or miss. i would reccommend the product because if you are on the go, it will be better than nothing!",neutral
"i received this hydrating gel moisturizer complementary from influenster and community sixty-six in exchange for my honest review. first, i like the name of the brand and find it meaningful seconds and days is all it takes to form a habit. the packaging has a minimalist color-way, and portrays a green message and i like the qr coding on the package, which was convenient to get more info on the product. it claims to be vegan and has no animal testing. in terms of value i thought the price was a little high for the small amount in the container. i like that the dispenser is a pump-type dispenser, which allowed for better volume control. the direction says to use a pea-size amount but i found it hard to easily glide over the entire face for full coverage, hence i needed more product than recommended. i also did not feel the product was gel-like and while initially the application was tackysticky like a heavy cream, it was not too hydrating as my face was dry again not too long afterwards. the product is fragrance-free, which means you will be smelling the natural scent of the product, but that did not bother me at all. overall i thought the price is too high for the amount in the container, especially when i had to use more than the recommended amount. i also did not think it was hydrating at all, so i will not be purchasing after finishing this product.",neutral
"i loved this paulas choice skincare c super booster! i am and have dry, aging skin, plus, on top of that i like spending time on the sun and deal with sun damage spots and uneven skin tone. this vitamin c serum has water like consistency, stays little sticky on the skin, but with moisturizer you will not feel it after some time. it made a noticeable difference in my skin tone. my skin looks brighter and my sun spots look brighter",positive
"i bought this mascara thinking it would be the perfect solution for my dry flaky skin. it definitely feels nice and does its job, and i have not used this for long, but it does not seem any different than any other moisturizer, except it is more money for less quality. it is a nice moisturizer, but it is way overpriced and definitely not better than my cetaphil night moisturizer for extra dry skin. it certainly makes you feel luxurious with the fancy bottle and the cute little unnecessary spoon at the top. if that is what you like and you do not mind spending the extra money, go for it. if you are looking for a good moisturizer, go get yourself some cetaphil or any other moisturizer that is better for super dry skin.",neutral
had weird black goo in it. i shook the bottle before opening and when i squeezed the dropper black gunk came out and has stuff inside of cap. i am returning this!,negative
"i got this as a sample from sephora, after two applications my skin became orange brown dull, will never buy",negative
"this balm is extremely thick not in the way you want it to be. i cannot massage it into the skin and i am left feeling stripped after washing. to clarify, i used the cerave acne cleanser which is not stripping or drying, so it is definitely not the cleanser. it does not feel right on my face and leaves behind a residue!! i do not care for the smell, and it burned my eyes. i feel like there is so many better options like clean it zero that are in the price range and effectively remove makeup. do not buy it because it is cheap!! no from me.",negative
so this product was a miss for me. it sat on top of my face and just did not appreciate the texture it provided,neutral
"i love the experience of this mask. the balm-like consistency does require at least pumps to spread it it comes out in tiny squirts, though. the sweet-herbal scent of blue tansy is so calming and certainly prevents any redness or sensitivity during and after the mask.i love that it feels cooling as you wash it off, and my skin does not feel stretched or pulled tight like after most peels.will likely buy it again, even with that crazy price.",positive
"i used this product x per day for a month and saw very little to no result in lightening my acne scars. i will not buy again. this product made my skin very soft, but that is it.",negative
"i have literally never had such a bad reaction to a product in my life. i do not have sensitive skin. i have used many vitamin c serums, retinols, etc. after one day of using this my face and neck started itching. i did not think it was from this so i used it again the next day. on the second day of using this my husband asked if i was ok because my face was so red. again, i did not think it was from this serum. on the third day i put on my makeup and realized i had a zillion pimples under my skin. literally everywhere. and i still could not stop itching my face and neck. then i finally put two and two together. i wondered if i should keep using it- maybe my face was purging?- but the itching and redness is insane! i have to stop using it.",negative
"i added this to my morning skincare after reading about the benefits of antioxidants against free radicals. is this effective in that capacity? no idea! but it feels nice on the skin and is a great price point, so i will keep using it.",positive
"i began using a deluxe sample...its like juice pulp comes out onto the cotton pad with the toner. the pulp bits look nasty so l do not think l am interested in using this toner, too strange for me to deal with.",negative
"generally i wear light weight moisturizers, like gels. however with winter here, my skin was getting dryer and peeling, so i had to find something a little more deeply moisturizing. this did the trick. i gave it some time after purchase to see if i would break out, as most heavy creams do to me, and i did not. it works well with other products tretinoin, toners, serums, etc and it even goes just fine under makeup. i do not need a lot of it either, just a singular scoop on the end of my index finger, so a little goes a long way. if you are super dry, you may need something heavier, but if you are a little dry, normal, or a little oily, i recommend giving it a go. stellar ingredients and feels luxurious without the froo froo.",positive
yes it applies very smooth and looks flawless upon application but there is no staying power it transfers like crazy even when i was blotting the product was coming off and secondly it is not matte i was very oily however if you use the powder that really helps all that said i really like it it is full coverage covers my acne very well and it is healthy for my skin..so yes i took off two stars because it needs to really be matte and it needs to stay on,neutral
"used very consistently twice a day, did not seem to make any difference",negative
"this smells great in the box but scent does not transfer to skin, lathers well and lasted for over weeks of showers. leaves my skin soft but still need to moisturize after. it was worth a try but i will not repurchase.",neutral
"smells amazing when you first spray, and then i do not really know what it does.i had high hopes for this one, it smells great and makes me feel amazing once i put it on. a few minutes later the original sweet watermelon scent is gone and i stop feeling so fresh. if anything, it makes me want to wash my face. the design of the bottle is super cute, and misting your face is super satisfying. i just wish the actual product made me feel more fresh or actually made me glow. it just makes me feel cute for a few minutes and then i want to wash my face.",neutral
i am not super impressed with this. you have to make sure your face has been properly exfoliated and moisturized before using these drops otherwise they will cling to your dry spots and look soooo bad. they look glowy and natural everywhere except my nose and around my eyebrows because they get so orange and dark around there. i put it all around my mouth too and there is still a white circle around my mouth where the tan did not absorb. not super happy with these especially since they are not cheap,neutral
this product works for some people. i bought thinking it was going to work and do miracles but it did nothing to my face. it might of not worked on me but others saying it work so i guess its for some people,negative
i added this serum to my skincare routine and it has helped my very dry skin tremendously!,positive
because me to break out in tiny pimples everytime i use it. i suffer from cystic acne which this seem to make worse whenever i use it.,negative
"i have been using this for a couple months now. it was sent to me from influenster. i like the face cream, it was moisturizing and feels good on my skin. it does not make me feel oily or heavy, but it does moisturize well. i do not know if it is worth the price though. i have not seen any anti-aging results yet that i have noticed. i would say it is a good face cream i just do not know if i would spend that much money on it. i have used better for way cheaper.",neutral

"i want to love it, but i just do not! i sincerely do not see a bit of difference using this.. i have purchased it many times and tried to stick with it.. it does nothing for me. it has a nice silky texture, easy to apply so i have a few stars for that but i just cannot get into it",neutral
"i used this cream as a trial for about a month, just in the night. i really liked too much. it absorbs quickly and i notice the difference in my dark circles that looks lighter and brighter. i have used a lot of brands and this is one of my favorites. i will buy a full size.",positive
i have been using this product for about a week. i was surprised with how thick the texture felt but it went on my face very smoothly. i was excited to try it because my face it very dry. i woke up with a nice glow and no irritation. i would highly recommend adding this to your skincare routine.,positive
i have really given this stuff a shot and after getting my rd zit on my upper cheek i give up. i am not acne prone so i know it is this eye cream.it is greasy and does not absorb which plays havoc with any kind of makeup you try to put on over it. concealer or foundation looks blotchy and streaky. you might as well use bacon grease instead of this stuff.,negative
this product made me break out like crazy. definitely returning it.,negative

this product does not remove eye makeup even after two applications.,negative
"i was very skeptical buying this especially because most of the reviews are fake or paid, but i gave it a shot anyway hoping i would see results. unfortunately this is one of the worst purchased i ever made, i really gave it a shot using it for months but it seems to have only increased my dark spot and acne. if you have clear skin and need a simple hydrating serum, this might be good for you... otherwise, seriously do not waste your money and do your research on more effective vitamin c forms.",negative
"i thought i will give this a try during the vib sale because there were such great reviews. i used it the first time and the texture seems nice gel like but once i put it on my face, the smell was just too disgusting-- cannot really describe it but reminds me of really bad plastic smell made me gag a bit actually. unfortunately, i will not be able to see whether this works or not. now looking for an alternative.",neutral
"i have extremely dry, sensitive skin this made me peel for days. it was terrible. they say aha is better for those with dry skin, but i have seen mixed reviews on that one as well, including breakouts which i am prone to... i have been using another product for years with no issues, skin medica. the cream somehow feels moisturizing actually works. i will be sticking with that.",negative

"bought this as an intro to using sunscreen on my face since i was starting to get into skincare. pros-very light nostalgic smell-no white cast-does what it says it does-price is not bad compared to other supergoop products-does not pill with makeup-bottle shape is neatcute-i can use it on face when going to the pool-long spfcons-if you have combooily skin bruh you are going to feel this on your face. if paired with a heavy moisturizer made my face feel super greasysticky and made it look mega shiny. i stopped using the moisterizer i was using to see if it got any better but not really.-hair would stick to my face because it would not absorb at all. so i had to keep my hair tied up.-if you live anywhere humid it will just sit on your face-better for dry skin types probably-you may not like the slight sunscreen smell-if you wear glasses, it might get on your glasses-if you touch your face then your phone it get on your phone.i will not be purchasing again. i personally stopped using it after about weeks. since i have combooily skin i ended up going with their mineral matte sunscreen for makeup and unseen sunscreen for nominimal makeup. i like a weightlesslight matte feel throughout the day so i am not sure why this was reccomended to me in store. however, it is a good sunscreen, just not for my skintype. i have some scars and a bf with dry skin so i will use this on that instead. will probably use it if i plan to go swimming for its water resistance and long spf.",neutral
"i love this product. it is a great beginners retinol. based off my experience with it, i did not peel, i did not purge a ton. i just got a few small pimples but they went away fairly quickly. i noticed that my skin was brighter just a week after using this product. i am only about weeks in, my skin has cleared up tremendously, it looks brighter and more plump.",positive
"i wanted to love this, but unfortunately it fell short. i love my coola spf mister but this one has an extremely strong smell that definitely lingers on your skin- about an hour after applying my partner told me they could smell it! it also burned the skin around my eyes, and as someone with oily skin, this left me feeling really greasy for hours after application. i bet this would work better for someone with dry, not overly sensitive skin.",neutral
"i was a little skeptical of this oil since its ingredients are pretty common, but i was lured by the beautiful packaging and the cleanliness of the product. i have been using this in conjunction with my jade roller, and i can definitely see a difference in the tightness and luminosity of the skin! i have been using this pretty consistently for about a month and will most likely repurchase.",positive
"nice smell and consistency, but i started realizing it caused build up and little flecks whenever i used it. i guess the combo of this product with my other routine products did not go well together and it looked like i had dry skin flecks all over my face when i was done. i had been using all other products for some time and did not have the problem until adding this serum to the routine. used for over a month and did not see any difference in brightness.",negative
"i agree with other users that this product can be hit or miss- i have had better and more consistent results with products like digest gold purchased from health food stores or amazon for about the same cost sometimes costing less!. the results with flatter me seem to be best when the enzymes are taken in the middle of a meal, but when i eat out, this does not do me much good unless i remember to throw them in my purse. taking them too late after a meal causes an upset stomach, as well as too soon before eating- but this would be the case with most products of a similar type. however, i have combined these with other supplements without issue. it is like anything else- just figure out what works best for you! not everyone needs digestive enzymes- sometimes you just need probiotics, or a combination of probiotics and enzymes for the best results. and eating clean always helps!",neutral

"i love this product. it foams up nicely, i like the gel consistency, and it does not smell bad. it deep cleans no black heads and large pores. the reason for only a-star review is because it is very moisture and oil zapping. it has not left my skin dry and flaky which is good, but i feel i am doubling up on moisturizer after wash and waking up with needing more moisturizer in mornings. it is almost on the lines as a exfoliate product. clean but leaving my skin thirsty",neutral

i have been using this for a week or so in place of the plain squalane oil from the ordinary and it is been nice! the one big thing i have noticed is how quickly it absorbs into the skin. the smell is a bit... weird? but i do not find it offputting and in my experience it goes away quickly enough!,positive

this product is all that i need. the packaging is simple and i like it. i love that sweet blueberry smell of it! this belongs to my all-time favorites cleansers now. it made my skin soft and smooth after two weeks of use. i will definitely get one again and hopefully there will more variant of this product.,positive

"i do not know why this has so many stars and i have no idea why it has an allure award. they did nothing. nothing for deep acne along my jaw line, nothing for the quick pimple i get with my period on my forehead or cheeks, nothing for white heads. it does not even have the little sting that i like with a spot a spot treatment i feel like there is no product on them. the origins spot treatment is x better. i bought them at the same time, i used a dot five nights in a row on the same pimple it did nothing it did not help with redness, sensitivity on the pimples that can be a little painful, or size. i threw them away. the origins did not make anything disappear over night but definitely improvement each night. yeah the origins bottle is small but for a tiny amount of something that works or for little bs dots is not a hard decision for me. never again. seriously.. try anything else.. i would rather put toothpaste on my pimple.",negative

"first time use.do not use this on your hands feet or face.. use sticky pads on your feet or wash the bottom of them with soap after spraying. trust me haha.. i used gloves as some other comments said they had to use so much product. i barely used that much, and it evenly rubbed in. basically spray in sections upper body rub rub rub- then arms- rub rub rub etc.. this is not drying so far. i left it on over night. rinsed in the am do not use soap first wash just rinse and use an ultra hydrating moisturizer while damp. i actually do not feel dry or have that burning feeling after as i do with some.. when done, use a damp wash cloth to hit your elbows wrists ankles and knees to prevent deeper color.. i did use this on my feet and hands. i did moisturize them prior too. it looks bad. very splotchy and uneven. i normally use a blending brush with a color guard light tanner on my hands and feet for this reason. so skip your hands feet and face so you do not have to go through the dreaded scrub off with dove for days.. i will add the scent is horrible. it does not stick after rinsing. so today, it is actually probably one of the least smelling tans that i have used, but while wet it absolutely smells horrible. the good news is that is does not stick and has almost no smell after rinsing.",neutral
"my go-to since. i have rosacea and this is very soothing on my skin, does not increase acne in fact i feel it has helped clear my skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft. a little goes a long way it foams up very well. i love it.",positive

"i have never wished i bought the mini size of something more than i do with this product! i love the smell unlike a lot of reviewers and that is why i am giving two stars rather than one. i saw no benefits from this, and it actually broke me out. i would not say i have overly sensitive skin either and never have an issue with breakouts until i used this. i love the fresh vitamin c line i will stick to that.",negative
"this is a fantastic cream. the rose scent is so dreamy, natural and not at all overpowering. i also really love the extra firm texture of the product in the jar.it spreads out and absorbs into my combination skin very well, as long as it is not applied too thickly. my skin truly stays moisturized from morning until evening, and i enjoy putting it on again at night!",positive

"i would have given this moisturizer stars if the price was not so high. with high prices come high expectations and this moisturizer just did not meet those expectations. moisturizing....yes. but any other benefit was not noticed within the time it took to use this up. i feel like the packaging got me...which is silly because i use a scoop with all of my tub moisturizers. overall, if you love drunk elephant and want a brand routine, this might be lovely for you. but for my normal skin i got bored with it quickly.",negative
"this was my first eye cream, okay enough for me to use the entire jar but i would not buy it again. some other reviewers mentioned the formulations biggest fault applied on freshly washed and dried skin, it does not rub into the skin, but rather slides off of it. there must be an agent missing in the formula that allows the oil to mix well with water. this is an important shortcoming because face products are absorbed the best before the surface of the skin completely dries.",negative
"pros good for sensitive skin, has spf, and felt plenty hydrating. cons this just does not work for oily skin! i saw a few other positive reviews, so i tried it out and was feeling hopeful, but it left me greasy all day no matter how many blotting sheets i used. overall probably a good bet if your skin is dry or normal, and certainly fine for sensitive skin.",neutral
sadly i am not a fan of this cleanser. i am a big fan of dr. dennis gross skincare so i was surprised when i did not like this. it does seem to work well at removing makeup but my face does not feel clean. it feels like it leaves a layer of something on my skin. i also felt like it was clogging my pores since i broke out all times i used this.,negative

seems to help not as much as the roll on.the smell of nair makes it lose a star.,neutral
love this cleanser. i have slightly sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all. i love that it foams up but does not make my skin feel tight afterwards. my skin feels clean and has a glow after i use it. highly recommend and will definitely buy again!,positive
this cream is very thick and does leave your skin smooth but it also leaves it slightly greasy and i am not a big fan of the smell. the greasy feeling does go away after a bit so that is not to bad and it does leave your skin feeling smooth. my main dislike is the scent it is like a heavy lotion smell if that makes sense. the scent is my main reason for the stars.,neutral
it is okay but i think it burns the skin a bit because of the zinc. i prefer the inkey list one. it is less sticky and does not irritate at all.,neutral

it is my own fault--i bought this before scrutinizing the ingredients and only after purchasing realized the formulation was all chemical instead of mineral actives. i returned this product and opted for a more environmentally friendly non-nanoparticle zinc oxide spf.psa reef safe and reef friendly are not terms regulated by the fda. read up on your product ingredients!,negative

i have always had stomach issues growing up. mainly stemming from nausea and discomfort. i have thought about trying probiotics in the past but never wanted to invest in them so i would just eat yogurt and other things of the sort. i have been taking these for almost weeks now and i would say that they have had a positive impact. while they have not totally cured my issues they seem to be slightly less frequent. one side effect that i have noticed is that i am more gassy than normal and burping a lot. not a negative effect but something that may bother some people. i received this product for free for testing purposes,negative
"this toner smells soooo good. left my skin feeling very smooth after just one use. except i am going to have to put stars because this is not a daily toner even though it was advertised as one. after a week of using it everyday, my skin was red and starting getting more acne than before. i think it was way too strong for my skin. i would recommend anyone else who has sensitive skin to use this maximum times a week. good product to try.",neutral

"i received this as a tester in a playbox i purchased and fell in love. after less than a week, it solved every eye problem i have ever had. my entire adult life, i have had an issue putting on eyeliner onto my right eye because of unevenness of the skin. now i can put eyeliner on almost too smoothly! i also have an issue with dry eyes so they water even with tear drops and eye primer. i have looked up plenty of solutions and nothing worked. wearing this a true story, i can go to a renaissance festival in degree weather with constant dust in my eyes, and my eyes do not water at all! my makeup has never looked better. after testing the sample and having all of these miracles, i tried a higher rated eye cream to see if it would work better. after two days of use, my eyes started watering again. returned it and bought the full size of this product. highly recommend.",positive

i normally love all yttp products but this is underwhelming. it only has. bha which is not a lot especially since they are promoting it as a niacinamide bha mask. it really does nothing for my skin and it is not a super big jar. and the more you use the more hard and awkward it is to get out of the jar. i regret buying this to be honest.,neutral

"gave this a try twice, broke me out both times. i really wanted to love it since it is oil free and seems to have oil controlling properties but it gave me whiteheads within a week. also, if you have combination skin, this is not for you. not moisturizing enough for your dry areas on the face. i recommend this for people that have really really oily skin!! disappointed",negative
best ever! have been using for years! please never discontinue!,positive
pills right off your face. i bought this once a few years ago and had the same experience and was hoping the formula had changed but nope. right into the garbage. had to redo my makeup as it instantly started flaking off.,negative
there is a trick to this that i just cannot seem to master. it has to be activated but that process does not always happen in the same way. the cream is like glue until it is warmed up. i did like it when the process went right but not enough to buy again.,negative
so far so good. it does not have a harsh smell and is gentle on my skin. it is better to use at night.,positive

"i have been using this for years. i loved it until they changed the formula. the new formula is really thick, so it feels like you need a lot of it to get an even application. this formula is not as mattifying as the original one i still get pretty oily during the day forehead especially. i have noticed lately as i apply it that it pills a little bit? i do not know how to describe it. it is like as i rub it in, it is somehow rubbing off... other stuff? like oil, dirt, dry skin, i am not sure. it is pretty weird. that being said, it is rich as a moisturizer and it does not make me break out the way other moisturizers do, so i like that. when i run out of this bottle, i will probably switch to the skin perfecting lotion as my daily moisturizer instead of this one or find a totally new one.",neutral
"i recently purchased a couple yttp products and this was one of them. i have oilycombo and acne prone skin. this moisturizer has a light texture and a slight spinach scent, like the cleanser. i apply this after the vitamin c superfood serum to slightly damp skin. this does not provide the amount of hydration i want but it does not make me shinygreasy which is great. i simply add a couple drops of the superberry oil and i feel that helps. i wish this was a bit stronger in terms of moisturizing skin, because i cannot handle the ashwaganda cream yet in the summer months. but it is not a bad moisturizer and i will use it up. i have been using this very sparingly so i think i need to use more for each application. happy to support such an ethical brand",positive
"i really wanted to like this product, but in the end i hated the smell so much that it did not make my nighttime routine enjoyable and relaxing, so i gifted it to someone else. the consistency of the product was a bit runnier than i expected and every once in a while it required a stir, as the product appeared to separate. it went smoothly onto my face and lathered nicely. it felt like it rinsed completely off the skin without trying. if i did not hate the papaya smell so much i would have continued to use it.",positive
"the product itself is alright. is it the best exfoliator i have tried? absolutely not. is there a huge difference? no yet, but it also did not breakouthurtdestroy my currently ridiculously sensitive skin. for an exfoliator? i count that as a win.in addition, i found the smell to not be overwhelming extremely important for me with skincare, and a little goes a long way...because it has no choice in the case of the mini. let me explain the mini, whew...this is not worth. the amount of product is, honestly, what i would expect from one of the bazaar rewards maybe like a pointer in a kit. you need to use a little because if you do not, you would absolutely be wasting your money. i would say wait for a sale, or get a sample in store if possible before committing. it is definitely not a hg for me personally. i would say if you can commit to the larger size during a sale, go for it. it is good for sensitive skin, the smell is not overwhelming at all and just because it is not my hg does not mean it will not be yours. for these reasons, i still recommend it. just not at the mini size just not enough product to get the full picture for results, in my opinion. i personally will continue to only use it once a week though the packaging does say twice is acceptable. i included the mini size next to a pen for size",neutral

"this one feels just okay! i think in your early s when you are just starting out, this could be great.. but it is just not doing much for me. no difference in the hydration or brightness of my under eyes, and the puffiness is not affected by this one either. with that said, it does not contain collagen or peptides, so for the price, i would rather have an eye cream that at least has the possibility of preventing further signs of aging. it is light, the texture is a bit hard to absorb, but zero skin irritation! if this sounds like it is still good for you, definitely try it-- just did not work out for me.",neutral
"amazing!!! i started using their nighttime smoothie which is the framboos, marula and protini mixed. weeks in and my skin was so smooth, soft and my acne scars were almost gone. i decided to give this a try since i loved the other products so much and i was not disappointed!!! the first week i did min followed by the free marula that it comes with and noticed just a slight tingle and some slight redness but no other issues so i went the whole next time. my skin felt amazing but it was not till week that i seen a huge improvement. no black heads, no large pores, acne scars gone, smooth skin, no bumps and the best part....i no longer needed any makeup!!! now i have added in the bronzer mixed with protini or marula in the morning for just a slight glow. i do not need anything else on my face since making the switch. i am seriously hooked on all of these products! my advice....buy all the kits! you get a ton of product for a fraction of the cost and then you can see for yourself how amazing these are!",positive

"got one from my roommate. the brightening effect is gone with a wash of your face. check the ingredients list-- that is because there are mica actually a quite decent amount of it and titanium dioxide in the product, and they paint your face brighter. if you have some cegep level chemistry knowledge, you probably know that, mica is what they add to your eyeshadows to creat the peralecent look while titanium oxide is the solid white paint that gives your physical suncereen the dull white look on your face. i will say that is kind of cheating as a skincare product-- most of the ingredients does not work on your cells at all, and the brightening effect is easily washed off. but it does its job as a moisturizer, and can be used as an not-so-bad primer which is the only reason i am not giving a star.",negative

"i like using the origins ginzing vitamin c eye cream underneath my makeup. it reduces the appearance of my dark circles and it is hydrating. the dark circles are not completely covered but it is lessened. it blends into my skin quickly. i like the use of vitamin c and niacinamide in the product. compared to other eye creams i have used, this is better at reducing the appearance of my dark circles while wearing the product. i would like to see the long-term effects though to see if it reduces dark circles over time. i would consider re-purchasing. i would recommend it to my friends.",positive
"after days of use this cleanser dried out my skin, and gave me a major breakout. i have used a non-waterproof mascara that normally comes off very easily, yet this cleanser did not manage to remove the mascara.",negative

"this is my first review despite the fact that i order from sephora constantly. omg, this stuff is amazing. i tend to use really high quality skin care stuff skin medica, rx tretinoids, skinbetter, etc. this stuff is amazing. it has taken years off my skin in just a few days. i am but i have the skin of a year old. i have no visible pores, my skin is smooth, dewy and glowy. it is crazy. it says to only use it a few times a week and not with retinols. however i have pretty thick and non sensitive skin so i have been using it morning and night and with retinols with no ill effects. this is worth the price, definitely!",positive
"thanks to influenster, i have actually tried belief products before and i love them! when using the aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream, this cream actually repaired my skin when it was suffering from some dryness from my current skin routine. i used this a few times and the dry patch went away. i really do love belief products, they do wonders for your skin. as a bonus, i have been using aqua bomb hydrating body moisturizer on my elbows and have really soften them.",positive
"i have been using this as a replacement for vitamin c, per labeautyologists on twitter observation that vitamin c does not work very well on dark skin in her opinion. after trying this out, i think she is right! even though my skin has always reacted well to vitamin c, i do feel like this worked faster to fade my hyperpigmentation. since this product is also forumulated with hyaluronic acid, i like that i can save money because i do not have to buy the ordinarys ha separately! my skin looks better than ever. i have been through two bottles of these already and i am getting some backups soon.",positive
i cannot believe how inexpensive yet effective this toner is! it removes all excess makeup after washing my face and you do not need much. i used previous toners that were and this is up there with them!,positive
"i got the mini size of this face wash and fell in love with it! i waited a few months and decided to buy the full size because the mini was so good. i do not know if they changed their formula or what but the full size dosent feel the same. it does not lather as well, and honestly my face dosent feel very clean after using it. its stinks but i will not be repurchasing once i am finished with this product.",neutral
i am on my second bottle but i have not noticed any difference in my sun spots or discoloration. i am a bit surprised considering the good reviews i saw. i am not sure which reviews are even real anymore based on who are influencers etc,negative
"love these! was very skeptical at first, but used as directed left them on for about hours while i was at home one day and it really worked. minimized both the size and redness of the area. you could barely see that there used to be a pimple. definitely use as directed, use on clean face and do not moisturize the area! i made that mistake one night and of course the disc would not stick.",positive
the mini daily milkfolient that was gifted to me by dermalogica is truly amazing! it has benefited my skin so much and leaves my skin feeling smooth! it is so easy to use! it has a nice texture a lot of skincare has sticky or weird feeling! very much recommend!,positive
"this eye cream works as a repair wrinkle corrector but even if you do not have much eye wrinkles, i feel like it works well for preventative care. it is whipped creamy texture glides around the eyes smoothly and gives the skin a subtle glow. it is thick enough to last around the eyes all night. after using it for awhile, i noticed i rarely get puffy eyes and dark circles. i also like that it does not have any fragrance smell to it. the only thing i struggled with was the jar itself. in order for you to not get it in your nails when putting your finger in it, you will need an applicator to get the product.",positive
"smells amazing, feels good when using, but did not notice much of a difference in my skin.",neutral
"this serum is so amazing! i had a little white bump on my nose for months that i could not get rid of no matter how hard i tried- after using this serum for a couple weeks, the bump completely disappeared! i have also noticed that the serum helps lighten any dark areas on my face after a few uses.",positive
i love thus cleanser. i use it daily and it is the only thing that has helped with my adult acne. kind of mad the company discontinued their medibac line but this is the same thing. definitely does not have the same effect but it is still really good. i always recommend dermalogica cleansers to people as they have been the only brand to help with my acne! after using this i only have my occasional breakout from hormones. as you see in the picture i have no makeup on except mascara and it cleared my skin. i have combination sensitive skin and this helped a ton!,positive
"this face wash made my skin feel nourished and not stripped. i definitely saw a decrease in my acne and hidden acne on my face. i struggle with deep pimples and they were definitely combated with this wash, which most acne washes do not. the combination of salicylic and azelaic worked really well for my skin. usually, i used just a salicylic acid wash, and this helped combat more of my acne issues. this is a holy grail for me and i have seen such an improvement in my acne. i highly recommend!",positive
"so i have been using this for quite a few months now. i have left which means that this lasts you quite a while. i use drops on a cotton pad and swipe it over my face. smells nice, a bit sticky to be honest, and feels a bit hydrating. i do not really know if it does much for my skin. my pores are more visible towards my nose and they are still just as visible. i am just using it because it is still quite expensive for something that is not that effective. for how much you get, the price is worth it, but for effectiveness i would not repurchase. very cute bottle though.",neutral
"decided to splurge and get this product with my christmas gift cards. it makes my skin so glowy and beautiful, it is a huge confidence booster. the packaging is also super luxurious, will definitely purchase again",positive
really wanted to like this since i love the unseen one but this one just did not work for me. for reference i have pretty dry skin but a solid skincare routine that leaves my skin very moisturized. when i tried applying this as the last step it pilled all over my face like crazy!! i tried so many methods of just patting slowly and in small areas which definitely worked better but just took forever and did not make sense to try and do every morning when rushing to work. i gave it a nd star because the glow it gives is seriously beautiful but the laborious process and pilling just did not do it for me.,negative
"i generally agree with the reviews here in that it removes makeup, but it is not particularly astounding at it. the description also says that you do not need to use water afterwards, but you definitely do...it leaves a greasy film and residue behind that definitely needs to be washed off. even if you have dry skin, it feels way too slick and oily to be leaving on your skin you should always be doing an actual washing of your face even after you use makeup remover anyways. i find most drunk elephant highly effective and straight-to-the-point, but this one is mediocre. i would pass on this.",neutral
"i did not like the texture and smell. but moreover, i felt no effect. i did not even feel any moisturizing post effect from that mask. absolute waste of money in my opinion.",negative
"if this would let me put stars i would. i did not like this product at all. i bought it because i have acne prone skin and very sensitive skin, i thought this would be good but overall i did not like it. the texture was so thick and oily. it was hard to wash off the remaining residue, has like a vaseline like texture.",neutral
"i have fairly dry skin and so i buy eye cream specifically to hydrate my eye area as my face moisturizer is too thick for the skin around my eyes. this just does not hydrate enough, especially now heading into colder months. it is just not doing enough for my skin and i notice the skin around my eyes ends up feeling tight hours after applying which it does not do with different eye creams. if you have dry skin, this is not for you.",negative
i rated this product because i do love the concept of what jlo has created for womens skin. but this spf is horrible! it is stinks! it is smells like that white glue from pre school. it peels off within a few minutes if i rub my face. and i can not wear under makeup or wear with the eye cream and serum.,negative
this product does nothing!!!! i have tried and tried and tried it over and over. it does nothing except make me look like shrek.,negative
"i have acne-prone, oily skin, but lately, my skin has been really dehydrated. i got this moisturizer to fix the dehydration, expecting that it might make my skin slightly more oily than usual. but i had heard so many rave reviews about this moisturizer helping dehydration that i thought it was worth it. sadly, this really disappointed. when you first put it on, it feels very thick and moisturizing, but not oily. the problem is that i never felt like it penetrated the surface of the skin. after an hour or so, my face would feel really yucky and oily, but still dehydrated. it did absolutely nothing to help my dehydrated skin. i gave it a because i like the packaging. there is a push dispenser, which is more hygienic than a typical jar of moisturizer. it does not have a fragrance, which i like. other skin types might find this hydrating, but it did not work for me.",neutral
"i was so excited to try this product but i just do not get the hype. maybe it is because i only received a deluxe sample and it just did not have enough time to work it magic. i found it difficult to apply. the directions say to splash in your hands and pat on which i tried but i felt like that wasted product by running too easily. if using a cotton ball, too much absorbs and then even more product is wasted. it made my skin feel dry and tight which is ironic since it is supposed to be hydrating. in the end i saw no difference in my skin at all after using it.",negative
this product destroyed my skin. i had finally cleared my forehead acne using the ordinarys squalene oil. added this as a moisturizer. have been using it for weeks and my acne is back with a vengeance!! do not recommend,negative
"had high hopes for this product because a friend with similar skin issues had been using this recommended. that just goes to show that everyone is skin is truly different! unfortunately, this product made the rednessunevenness of my face get worse. feels a little on the stickier side to me also when rubbing on my face. night serumsmasks have never done anything for me, so i should have went with my gut on this one.",negative
"this saved my skin, i have had clogged pores and textured skin tiny bumps all over my forehead since i was pimples here and there! i have tried every single product on the market nothing has worked but i took a shot with this product it is the only thing i have changed in my skin care and my face is completely clear i have used it for days!!! there is a drastic difference in my skin! can not recommend this enough!!! also first review i have ever written here had to let everyone know! says a lot!! buy this!",positive
"i bought this product hoping for a sunscreen that would provide a nice glow for the summer months. applying enough product to provide any kind of spf protection creates an unnatural shimmeryoily look. from what i have seen on social media, the people that rave about glow screen are using just a tiny amount of product, definitely not enough to provide any kind of sun protection.",negative
"i happen to have dry, acne prone skin--not oily. the formula feels like a silicone mattifying primer so not great for dry skin. i did not want to waste the product so i ended up mixing it with another face cream and it was fine. would not rebuy only because of the formulatexture.",neutral
i really like this product. it is very effective in helping to relieve my redness.,positive
i rarely had cystic and continuous acne until i started using this moisturizer. i know that many people live by this moisturizer but i wanted to point out it is not for everyone. keep in mind i have sensitive oily skin.,negative
"worked well at first like it did not sting my eyes as i expected, but then tiny bumps started showing up all over my face. not good for those prone to fungal acne or sensitive to essential oils.",negative
it helps to reduce the pimple but not worth it for the price.,neutral
there are not enough heart emojis to describe how much i love this. every time i use this my skin looks brand new and when i wake up i am still glowing. if you use this after a deep clean or an exfoliator there will be a mild sting. i use this two time a week and my skin loves it!,positive
"i love this product. i have really bad acne and my face is super sensitive, i also have dehydrated and oily skin. i am very picky with products and when i saw this i was intrigued. the only downside is that the bottle is supperrr smalll and i wish it came in a bigger size.",positive
"for all the hype these patches get, i expected to at least see something! glad i only went with the patch pack because i have tried it all kinds of acne. white heads, under the skin, those little tiny maskne bumps, even the giants pimple that are actually filled with pus. saw absolutely zero improvement. for such a price tag for so little material you would expect to see at least a little improvement with the first placement",negative
"this a convenient way to apply eye balm without getting my fingers dirty. i do wish this product is a little more balmy because if its not warmed up, then it can drag around my eyes, and having to warm it up kind of defeats the point of keeping hands clean.gifted by peace out skincare",neutral
this clay mask is amazing. you can see a difference after using it just once. i definitely recommend it.,positive
"at first when i bought this i loved it, but then i started to notice it would make my makeup pill during application.now three months later i went for it and saw that it had shrunk and dried up.",negative
"this mask was good not great. after only one use i am not able to tell if it did much. it does make your skin feel minty and cool while it is on. after my face felt tighter, but my skin was not drastically different. the pricepoint is fair. i am not sure if i would continue to use this product as i have sensitive skin.",neutral
"i purchased this product a long time ago, and at first i used to love it. if you use only two or three drops it looks nicegives you a slightly tan look. but when i used or drops, it turned out uneven and orange.",neutral
"i have been using this for a few weeks every night under my nightly moisturizer. the product pumps out easy into my hand which for some reason i find way more convenient then sticking my finger into a bottle and scooping out some- i can even do it with my eyes closed. i apply it all over my face and neck, and it goes on easy. there is no stinging at all, and a little goes a long way. no new wrinkles so far!",positive
"after using this for about two weeks, i realized my under eyes were pretty burned. i use a daily retinol, so i think the combo of both the under eye cream and my day retinol was just too strong for that sensitive area. but, i loved how lightweight and fragrance free it was! i immediately saw that my circles were lighter and the area was much more moisturized. i unfortunately had to stop using, but i am hoping i can try it again!",neutral
i thought allthe reviews were people being rough on the product. nope. mine broke literally as i was taking the wrapper off. dispenser will not advance product now. the packaging is awful.,negative
i have been using this during the day and murads vitamin c serum at night. together they have noticeably lessened the hormonal and acne scar related hyperpigmentation on my forehead and cheeks by about in a month. nothing is a miracle worker but not a decent product.,neutral
it did not work sadly i got more acne i had to throw it out but i gave it many chances even on my body but nope,negative
it did help to reduce redness on my skin but it also made me break out. i do not have an acne prone skin and got these hard and red pimples on my chin. stopped using it for a few days but i broke out as soon as i started using the product.,negative
"this product was provided free to me by influenster in exchange for my honest review. unfortunately this product is not for me. i love the sweet smell and that it glides on easily. however, i experience a burning sensation that makes me eyes water when i use it. it also felt tacky and took quite some time to dry. i did not feel it blurred fine lines for me. i want to say i love it, but i just cannot.",neutral
"while the concept is unique and intriguing, this product essentially is doing nothing to better your skin as a whole. in addition to its non-effectiveness, it does not necessarily cool your skin unless it is placed in a fridge. the concept is nice in theory, but the rubbing of the stick directly on your skin over and over makes the product unsanitary.",negative
i have dry sensitive skin so this was irritating. but i was trying to lighten some sun spots it did help. i used on my neck because i had a big sun spot it helped make go away. i do not use it on my face though.,negative
it is okay. not my favorite. it has a faint smell that does not smell the best but i can get past it. my garnier sulfate free cleanser from the drugstore is just as good,neutral
"i like to put it on only at night because it is thick. it did not reduce the redness around my nose due to seborrheic dermatitis. it is been only a week, i like it but i will not buy it again.",neutral

pros balm smells amazing i saw someone compare it to jolly ranchers and it definitely has that fruity smell to it cons balm does not remove all your makeup and leaves a greasy film of course balms are not meant to be used alone but i have never used a balm that makes me want to wash my face so fast,neutral
"i think this works just fine. it does cleanse my skin and remove my make-up. this is something you can use in the shower as a first cleansing step without issue, however, i have another cleansing balm i prefer to use and i find this does not live up. i have acne prone skin, and do find that this adds a little bit of oil to myskin chemistry after use. i prefer to use this as a face mask before showering and it has a really nice feel it does not affect my skin chemistry if i use it as a mask. i think it is more effective as a mask overall. plus, the price point is fantastic. i will definitely be trying more from the inky list.",neutral
it is very moisturizing but to remove makeup it takes a double cleanse.,neutral
been using this at night along with the ordinary toning solution. i can see a difference with my skin tone. it is gentle and slowly fades away my acne scars,positive
"ok i have been using ivory dish soap as my face wash for about years! it is scent free and easy on my skin so i have never changed but recently i decided to try out an actual facial cleanser and i am beyond happy with my choice! this cleanser feels so incredibly nice after i wash my face, it feels genuinely clean and bright afterwards, i have really good skin to begin with but i feel like this has made it even better after using it for a few weeks. also the smell is absolutely amazing, i love blueberry scent and they nailed it with this one for sure!",positive
"i fell for the hype. this just did not work for me. in fact, it caused my skin to become irritated, dry, red, flaky, and dehydrated- regardless of the other products i used with it. i wanted to love it, but this is not for sensitive skin, despite the claims.",negative
"first of all, i bought this with my own money and i feel like a lot of the good reviews are coming from pr. this oil has a super thick consistency, literally like honey. my fave is not even sensitive and i do not really get deep pimples, but man oh man, this gave me the worst breakouts i have ever had in my life. at first i was not sure if it was this that was causing it or something else so i did a process of elimination and this was definitely the culprit. each time i used this, i woke up the next morning with deep, painful pimples on my chin and forehead. this has coconut oil in it and coconut oil is known to clog your pores. i did not want the oil to go to waste so i put it on my arms and legs until it was empty. please buy a different oil!",negative

"i really did not see much of a difference after using this product for like two weeks. it did leave my face feeling extremely sticky and uncomfortable, especially when i used it alone",negative
"when i first purchased this product i would have given it a higher review than now. honestly, it is very good, but not worth.. many less expensive glycolic exfoliaters can give comparable results. it does not last very long, and the packaging is deceiving. i do not like it when i cannot tell when my product is almost out. it is a good mask, just not worth the price in my estimation.",neutral
this is by far my favorite moisturizer. i can feel my skin absorb it and it is very gentle which is great for my extremely sensitive skin. worth the price tag.,positive
"i love how inexpensive this is, especially for how long it lasts. and i love the cardboard packaging and lack of plastic. very travel friendly no leaking. that being said, i used this cleanser for about a full year. i had great skin, got rid of breakouts, etc. however, i think it slowly stripped my skin overtime, because my skin changed to so extremely dry and nothing i tried fixed it...until i switched back to my old cleanser. within days all of my dry patches cleared up. i wish it worked for me, but my skin was peeling from my nose to my chin, i had red rashes from how raw it was, i could not wear makeup to cover it up, and i spent too much money trying to find moisturizers and masks that would fix it, just to find out it was as easy as switching cleansers.",negative
"i am torn about how i feel about this product. when i first applied the cream, i found it was hard to thoroughly rub into my skin and looked a bit chalky and i have fair skin. i also felt like it was difficult to completely remove at the end of the day. after using it a few more times, the texture has grown on me and it has not caused any break outs. i would give this a higher rating but i am not a huge fan of the ingredients. it has parabens and other chemicals that i try to avoid in skin care. the bottle also has a warning that says it is highly flammable and to avoid using it around flames or even while you are smoking!!!. that is super concerning. all in all, the product is ok but i probably would not buy it in the future, purely based on the ingredients.",neutral
"vitamin c is one of my favorite facial products. i have used drunk elephant and skinceuticals and wanted to try a slightly cheaper brand, but unfortunately this product did absolutely nothing for me. no change in sunspots. i give it two stars because it did not break me out or because any skin sensitivities.",negative
"seemed to help with pore size, but left started to dry my skin out at the same time. had to stop using it. maybe better for those with oilier skin? i say not recommend, but just for my skin type.",neutral
"as much as i love this product, they raised the price on it and i can ot justify using this daily for. it did leave my face very soft and fresh and was a great mix between a stronger cleanser and an exfoliator, but i am mad about the price hike.",neutral
"while this cleaner is on the more gentle side for sensitive skin, it is super expensive and there are others on the market that are just as gentle and much cheaper. this cleanser is not anything special and should not be priced so high.",neutral
"one of my favorite things about this product is the graphic packaging. i i love having an aesthetic home, and this adds to it. however, i have dry skin, and this product lose my skin even more dry. i would probably recommend this to people with oily skin, but not people with dry skin.",neutral
"i heard about this product through instagram and was excited to try it. i have oily and acne-prone skin but was really trying to focus on repairing my moisture barrier. i thought this would be the perfect product! however, it broke me out constantly. i tried it for a week but had to stop due to the breakouts of small, skin colored acne with no head on my chin area which was so hard to get rid of!. i tried again a couple of weeks later and the acne returned. i really wanted to love this product but it just was not for my skin type.",negative
"i received this product complimentary from glow recipe. to start, this has the classic glow recipe watermelon scent which i absolutely love. it glides right onto your skin and you can instantly notice the glow effect. my favorite way to use this is to use it as the last step in my skincare routine, though it works great as a makeup primer as well. i highly recommend this!",positive
i have always had dark circles under my eyes so i was happy when i found this product. unfortunately i do not see huge results from using it. it does help a bit but nothing too noticeable.,neutral
"let me start by stating that. i have very dry skin that flakes and feels on my face.. i live in minnesota and the temp has been about-f for the last week. my skin is in agony right now and my makeup looks like crap all the time because of it. i just got this moisturizer and i am pretty happy with it. most face creams i need to use about a quarter-sized amount for my face alone insanely dry skin, remember? but this stuff is the first one i have tried that claims to be ultra hydrating and actually is. it also claims to be light weight which it definitely is not. this cream is thick and heavy when applying. however, its going to give you more moisture than other face cream you have. also, it is full of great ingredients without an overwhelming scent of perfume which i am super thankful for. although this cream is thick, and takes a bit of extra time to soak into the skin, it does soak in and make your face feel soft and supple, but not greasy. good value? i mean, if you are cool with spending on a moisturizer than this falls right in line with other quality creams. i have not tried it under makeup yet, but this is definitely my new go-to winter moisturizer.",positive
after the first few days i saw no improvement and my entire eye area looked dark brown. i used it for a few more days and my eyelashes started falling out. about in a day. also my eyes were watering like crazy.,negative
"amaaaaazing! i like to pat a few drops on my skin after i moisturize. especially soothing after using an ahaother chemical peels. love, love, love, and i do not mind the smell of herb either.",positive
i only gave stars because it hard to take off and really does not do much. i found more success using straight up tea tree oil and water than this but maybe it is just me. hope this helps.,neutral
"this soaked into my skin nicely and did not feel sticky when applied. however, it did not leave me matte for very long, nor did it absorb my natural oils. my face started getting oily within an hour or two. worse, though, it made my face crazy tomato red. had to return.",neutral
"absolutely amazing, bought this because i ran out of my usual and read a lot of good reviews. this cleared my skin and really added a whole new glow to it. recommend it is just too good price wise and product wise",positive
at first i thought it was just a normal cleanser that did not do much but after a while i noticed my blemishes reducing and it leaves my skin so soft. i have combination skin and prone to breakouts but as long as you use it everyday you should see results!! i am running out and will buy a new one.,positive
"on one hand, i like the formula and the cooling tip of the applicator. on other hand, i find that unless i clean it out with a q tip every time it leaves product in the dispenser and get sort of gross. not sure if others have this issue. not sure i can recommend",neutral
my skin feels clean after but that is about it. i dint notice any difference in my pores which is a shame since that is what i bought the product for. been using twicethree times a week for a month and see no difference,neutral
"this is awful. smells terrible, does not feel nice on the skin and broke me out tremendously. felt like a darn teenager again with acne. thankfully i did not spend money on this directly. it came in a subscription box. do not buy this if you are acne prone or have sensitive skin.",negative
"this cleanser was just ok. i do not mind spending big bucks on skincare if it works, but this did not do anything special and even two pumps felt like it was not enough. also i noticed it gave me some white heads that i have never gotten before. when i stopped using this, they went away! there is better medical grade foam cleansers that work better and last longer this one only lasted. months... and the price was kind of ridiculous.",negative
"i really like this mist. it smells great and makes my skin feel hydrated. it is not sticky at all. the spray is a nice, fine mist. remember to shake well. i like to wear it under my makeup as an initial step in my skincare.",positive
i really wanted to like this and by itself it seems like a good product but it does not sit well under anything i put on top of it. any moisturizer or makeup i put on top pills and i have tried using it with different things but the result is always the same.,neutral
i have tried a lot of tanners before but this one is certainly the best! the formula is perfect and the color-correcting helps get a clean even tan that looks natural. leaves you looking golden and glowing. recommend to everyone!,positive
"gentle, foaming, yet powerful cleanser. this is great for your morning routine because of the gentle formula- can work in the evening as well but you will definitely have to double cleanse to break through sunscreen and makeup. i will mention that this smells great and is comparable to the fresh soy cleanser.",positive
"this was just okay for me. it did not feel moisturizing and felt more like i was putting regular lotion on my face. the ingredients sounded like amazing stuff, but i am not feeling the effects of it. luckily, i got to try this as a birthday sample sized gift.",negative
amazing for dry skin as well as combination skin. my skin is usually on the combo to oily side however i have spent a lot of time fireside during the holidays and my kin was not happy about it! this oil feels like life being reapplied to my face,positive
"this is a good product, but you are paying a lot of packaging, you cannot recycle without taking everything apart, and a lot of product gets wasted, which is just irresponsible. plus all of a sudden the dispenser just stops working, even though there is still a lot of product left inside. i will buy again if the packaging gets changed.",neutral
i was quite disappointed. my face has never been so dry after using a face cleanser and it was irritated. i used to use the nuture me cleanser and loved it and thought this might be similar but it was not.,negative
"super pretty sunscreen, and it works well too. i have fitzgerald ii skin and used it on a caribbean vacation. unfortunately, i also got a photo allergic contact dermatitis. so be wary if you have sensitive skin or have had a reaction before.",neutral
"i love this mask in the winter and anytime my skin is looking dull, dry, or flaky. sometimes my skin is so sensitive that even putting moisturizer on hurts- when that happens i reach for this stuff. so good!",positive
"obsessed with this oil, added it to my beauty routine and really feel like it made a difference. love this brand!",positive
"i like the product and the fact that is it is refillable, unfortunately i probably will not be repurchasing as the product is so thick it is more like a balm, and it is caused my under eye to break out a bit. if there were a light weight option i would try it. consider",neutral
this did absolutely nothing for me. first it did not lather up very well and when washing this off it left a film on my skin and i did not feel clean at all. plus the smell is very strong! i did not mind it but if you are sensitive to fragrance this is not for you. i got halfway through this and had to use a different cleanser and that is when i realized how bad this was doing for my skin!,negative
eh. did not see any major changes even after using the whole bottle. try other ones with more potent formulas that can still be clean like drunk elephant.,negative

"this is by far the best scrub that i have ever used. i am not one to typically go for products that you can use on face and body but for me, this product is worth making an exception. i recently purchased and have only used a few times but wow can i see a difference. i have combination skin but am sensitive at the same time and this did not irritate me in any way. i also suffer from eczema and many products can irritate me but this did not- neither on my face or body. i really saw and felt the difference in my skin almost immediately. i cannot believe it is so gentle but so deep cleaning at the same time. highly recommended!",positive
"i hate this cream, i bought it for the hype that was on instagram about this to help with my dry skin, but honestly it went so greasy on me, and break me out badly. i bought de fab ultra repair cream and that work really well, give me moisture for all day and did not broke me out.",negative
i recieved this item with my play box and used it everynight by itself for about a week and it worked great!i paired it with my neutrogena gel cream and the combination irritated my skin and raised a little rash! it went away once i washed my face but just be careful! luckily my husband noticed it and i washed my face right away.,positive
"i like the formula of this so much. it is light enough that i can layer it in the serum stage of my routine yes it is an oil but i have found it absorbs quickly, and it sits well under makeup to keep my dry skin happy. for night time, i will use it as a final serum and then finish with an occlusive moisturizing cream. it is not something everyone needs but i find myself using it at least once a day if not twice.",positive
"i tried this with nothing on my face and still had pilling. i always use fingers of sunscreen and maybe it is due to putting too much at once and you may have to work in sections but personally i do not want to have to spend more time slowly blending in my sunscreen when there are so many other better and more affordable options. also, this burns if you get it in your eyes so be careful if you put it around thay area. for something similar, i love the bellflower watermelon fresh sunscreen and there is a fragrance free option. overall i do not recommend this",negative
"i really the light weight consistency of it and the fact that packaging has a pump. i found pump to be enough to cover my neck and chest. as for results, it is hard to say as i only use it a few times a week. i think this is a product i will gravitate towards more when i can use the extra moisture in my routine.",neutral
was disappointed nice bottle vinoperfect does better job,negative
i received this complimentary product in my influenster voxbox. i have been using it for a week now and my skin feels smoother already. cannot wait to see the results in a few weeks!,positive
great price for a vitamin c serum. i liked it at first but it caused my skin to be a little irritated. it just oxidized only after a month and a half. there is more than half still left. a little disappointed i will not be able to finish it.,neutral
"i was hesitant at first, because the idea of it sounded like a grease ball of my face waiting to happen. but! boy was i wrong. it leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple and most importantly...clean. i do not think my skin has looked this good in a long time. purchased the small container but i have a feeling i will be buying the larger one next time.",positive
it ok. i could not do an entire review but it does strip your face not very moisturizing. it does not remove makeup,neutral
overall this is a pretty good serum. it is light but does feel hydrating on my skin. it has not caused any breakouts but i do not see any major improvements either. one thing i dislike very much is the shape of the container. it is a tube that is rounded at the bottom so it is difficult and awkward to store.,neutral
"this is a very gentle product that removes even the most stubborn makeup from my skin, preparing it for washing with a gentle wash. this wash does not irritate my sensitive skin, leaving it soft and hydrated. my highest recommendation!!! this is the holy grail of precleanse washes!!",positive
"i love this cleanser! i started using this a few years ago after realizing that i was over-drying my skin with acne products. this cleanser helped restore the moisture to my skin and reduced my oil production. it truly does not clog your pores like other oils such as coconut oil. i stopped using it and started using a different soap that was cheaper, and was wondering why my skin was breaking out so much more. i really think it was because i stopped using this soap! i restarted it a few weeks ago and my skin is getting clearer. do not worry about the price- it is worth it to have clear skin!",positive
i wanted to try this brand so i bought several of the mini sized products and this one was a miss. i felt like i had to use a lot of cleanser to feel like it was cleansing my face at all. the smell was not horrible but it was not that great either. in the end i washed my face again with a trusted cleanser and gave the rest to a friend. it is gentle to the point of not feeling effective. it did not hurt my skin or anything but it did not get the job done either. i am going to pass on this product. the spray toner is amazing however!,negative
"after a week of using, i have noticed a difference not a huge one but i am not getting breakouts as often my and skin is soft!",positive
"i got this in a holiday gift set so i figured eh it does not irritate my skin so i will give it a shot. this is by far my new fave moisturizer! the first pic is my face at work you can see my eczema is screaming at me. it was super irritated and awful. the second was after one use of this stuff no itchiness and so much relief all at once. i do not even have to use that much of the product! trust me, if you are going to invest in a moisturizer and you have dry skin and eczema, this is by far one of the best.",positive
"this product was my first foray into the world of serums and i have sensitive skin so it may have just been too much for my face. i found this product to be irritating, especially in the chin and cheek area and it did not go away or subside over time even though i was very gentle in the application patting one pumps worth all over my face with my palms. it does smell nice though it does feel sticky. i will try the truth serum as well as that may be a better fit for vitamin c beginners.",negative
"i purchased this because it advertised as if you liked cottonseed cleanser you will like this one. nah... it is different... i did not like this one,it also has a strong smell. so sad the cottonseed is gone.",negative
"has a combination of salicylic acid, azelaic acid, and niacinamide- really attacking the pimple from getting worse and helping repair the skin to prevent acne scars. definitely be careful with the tube, alot does come out if you press too hard but there is alot of product for the price which is nice. love the brand is cruelty free and uses recycled packaging too!",positive

"i received this product complimentary from innbeauty project. i would like to note that the texture is very soft and smooth, which makes it easy to blend the product. this product is especially suitable for dry skin, as a product for spring and summer, and also before applying foundation to get the effect of the morning glow of the skin.",positive
"i am a huge fan of the inkey list products. i personally had been waiting for this specific product. i absolutely love this moisturizer. i wish i could dip my whole body in a jacuzzi sized jar of this wonderful, lightly whipped moisturizer. it is not too light or to heavy in terms of texture. it is great for all skin types if you are ultra sensitive, i always suggest trying a sample first. you can feel a light firming sensation upon the first application. this moisturizer is full of good ingredients for your complexion peptides which booster your collagen elastin, hydrators, etc. your skin will thank you.",positive
"sorry, i do not get it. this is like wet baby powder. i cannot see or feel any exfoliating. it produced no noticeable exfoliation. glad i only bought the mini because it is a waste of money. save your money.",negative
got it as a sample from sephora play box. i used it for days straight. in the evening on second day i noticed my skin started to break out. i did not use any makeup on top. i have combination to oily skin. do not recommend it.,negative

"i bought the large holiday sk-ii and it was a waste of money. it did nothing for my skin. not refreshing, not brightening, nothing. i give it stars. if it was more inexpensive i may have given it one star. i used it up because i did not want to waste my spent on this product... although it was a waste. save your money people.",negative
not sure if product works well sample to small to determine,negative
"such a huge disappointment. it was awful. it made my hair dry and frizzy, with a greasy dullness. i used it for weeks, because i really wanted to give it a chance to work, since i had purchased the giant size. but in the end, it made my hair into such a lifeless blob, that i have to question whether this stuff is really pure argan oil. sidebar note i am a longtime avid fan of moroccanoil pure argan oil. my hair is thick, course, curly, and color-treated and it does really well with liberal amounts of argan oil applied to wet hair. i am over. but my curls look rich and healthy, with a nice separation. never frizzy, heavy, or greasy. so when the morrocan argan oil was out of stock, i bought a giant size of the josie stuff, thinking all argan oils are the same. word to the wise- they are not!",negative
"i am a little dissappointed with this product because i feel like it actually did not work or do too much for my face. i loveee the way it smells litterally like strawberries and once you start rubbing on your face the product get warm which melts the sugar almost immediately. because of this, i felt like it did not really exfloliate, it just kind of cleansed my skin and i still would feel like dirt or dead skin on my face.",neutral
i am not a huge fan of this serum for a couple reasons but i can see why some people like it. for me it is way too much like a makeup primer rather than a skincare product. it makes your skin look instantly better because of its silicone texture and pearlescent coloring. to me it is more of a makeup product rather than a skincare step. i understand it has other good for your skin ingredients but they are pretty far down the list. i would much rather use skincare that is going to be good for me long term rather than an instant temporary fix. i will probably use what i have left on my neck because i do not like the silicone smoothing feel on my face as a skincare step.,neutral
"ok, so this scrub is unlike any other scrub. it requires a bit of a learning curve but bare with me. at first, when i started using this mask i did not really like it, it was really harsh and i felt that my face with burning up. however, when i started doing a technique of rubbing it in my hands first and then applying it to my face it was a game changer! it did not feel as harsh, and it actually really satisfying! i bought the whole kit cleanser, exfoliator, mask, and toner and out of all four this was the must-have product!",positive
"first of all, i am not even sure how i can trust ratings anymore on sephora because i wrote a review for this already and sephora took it down. sephora, stop taking down peoples reviews! anyway, i do not like this product because it smelt weird, irritated my skin, did not do anything for my skin and it is way overpriced for how much it actually costs tatcha to make this. it was overall a disappointment and a waste of money, i do not recommend.",negative
"this stuff is amazing! i mean truly amazing! i have combo skin and it hydrates while not making me oily! i use this daily with their vitamin c solution and i have noticed a huge difference in my skin tone, fine lines, and dark circles! a little of this goes a long way! the big bottle will last you a year!",positive
"i received this item complimentary for my honest review. honestly, this is not my first de product and once again i am less than impressed. i found the marula oil to be heavy and pore clogging. i like the idea of the product but i do prefer a higher percentage retinol product that i can combine with a good evening moisturizer instead of an oil like this one.",negative
"amazing product with a really cool viscous consistency but still somehow very thin. i have combo skin and i love using this when my skin is feeling dry as an essence before moisturizer, and when i am feeling oily i use it alone in layers. it has enough hydration while still refining my texture and pores. really versatile product! will repurchase.",positive
i received this serum complimentary from glow recipe. this serum made my skin feel really hydrated and plump. i am going to incorporate this product into my skin-care routine because it feels really great on my skin. the texture is really nice and lightweight. my skin looks hydrated! it layers really well with other skincare products.,positive
i love drunk elephant skin care however this is a fail! it smells terrible and the formula is super sticky!,negative
i am dry- normal combination. i used this product as a mask moisturizer as suggested. i did not feel like this hydrated my face. i would have to reapply another moisturizer within a few hours of applying this one. the texture of it was pleasant which is why i gave it two stars.,negative
"got as my birthday gift and was super disappointed. i have combo skin and my skin felt extremely tight and stripped after using it. on top of that, it caused a ton of acne. the fragrance is also way too strong.",negative
"loved all the ingredients and was excited to try it out but unfortunately it did not work out. once i patted it on my face, it stung! i really wanted to love this product but nope.",negative
smells horrible and also i do not see big difference with my pimples honestly,negative
i bought this product in the min size because i wanted to try it. i was able to get three pumps from the ml size. i had to pry the top off to get to the other third of the bottle. i contacted sunday riley as i do not feel that it is sephoras problem. will not buy sunday riley again. very poor customer service. product is good if you can get to it.,negative
could never get my non waterproof mascara off with this balm,negative
"first impression i liked it. it is a lightweight cream with a very subtle scent that absorbs into the skin smoothly and quickly. it made my face feel refreshed and not like it was clogging my pores. it left a light glow to my skin which i loved.fast forward to a month after use and i would say the product is not for me. although it says it is for safe for sensitive skin, about a week after use i started noticing breakouts on my face along my lower chin area which i never experienced before. overall i would say that i am not a fan, simply because i did not see the results due to my skin having a negative reaction to the product. after a month i did not see a minimizing of pores and i still had the breakouts along my chin. i would not recommend this product for people who have combooily skin or are prone to sensitivity from using new products. however if you do not suffer from skin sensitivity i would definite say give it a try. it is lightweight, airy, has a subtle scent and absorbed into the skin very well without leaving the feeling of heaviness or residue.",neutral
"i love this mask! i get a lot of white heads and i felt this really cleared my skin without drying it out, which was the most important thing to me. i tried the aha tata harper mask and it had dried out my skin so much and left it so red, i hated it. this clears my skin and leaves it beautiful, which is a definitely plus. i recommend for dry skin!",positive
"this line is for the global elite. if you do not earn top wages, move on. let me explain why. i see reviews in which people state they only use the serum around areas with fine lines, or they only use a few drops, so a little goes a long way. the problem, and this is completely evidence based, is that sturm has chosen dropped packaging. which means that the product must be used within days, or it will oxidize and lose potency. please research the process of oxidation in skincare. all skincare should be in air tight containers to prevent oxidation. the best brands are. i have personally reached out to brands i wanted to love and challenged them on their packaging. one very popular brand blatantly lied to me and insisted that their products did not oxidize, which is just not true or possible. all chemical compounds i.e everything exposed to light and air will be altered and lose potency. save your money unless you can afford to go through the entire bottle in days. go see a dermatologist and get a five dollar tretinoin prescription and use a nice moisturizer over it. i gave the product three stars. it is a nice product. her products are generally nice. i personally love her toner and use it every day. to the person who complained about phenoxyethanol it is in almost every product on the market. it is a germicidal preservative. if it was not in products they would be even more prohibitively expensive because they would not be shelf stable and thus companies could not scale product and keep back stock. it is a well researched ingredient and it is safe.",neutral
"personally i do not find it does much, and it burns my skin.",neutral
"i received this product free to review. this did not sway my opinion of the product. this is quite a beautiful luxurious feeling product, very true to many dior products. it glides on the skin nicely and leaves a beautiful smooth soft matte finish. i would agree it does blur slightly in the finish but nothing extreme. if feels light and smooth on the face, not too heavy. does not seem to have any affect on the longevity of my makeup, but does not shorten it either. the one thing to point out is that this product has a very heavy fragrance which does last a while. if you do not like fragrance in your product, you may want to stay clear of this one. if you have used dior products in the past, then you will not be surprised how this product feels on the skin. i cannot speak to the skincare aspects as i have only used it a few times and skincare benefits will take longer to show but as a primer to give a soft matte finish, it is a beautiful product.",positive
"it gives good redness reduction. the jar feels nice and heavy, and i enjoy the medicinal scent. but the texture is so thick and a bit grainy. i would not repurchase it because it rubs off on everything, feels greasy, and is too thick. keep in mind, i have dry, dry skin. i could not imagine wearing this if i were oily.",neutral
"maybe i just was not using it correctly, but i found this to be super runny and not very hydrating. just generally disappointing. the one pro is that it did not because any breakouts or anything.",negative
"i was very excited when i saw that they reformulated this product to be oil free and have a more neutral undertone because the oiliness and warm tone were my only complaints. unfortunately, now the issue with this product is the pilling. even if you wait mins after applying your moisturizer which nobody has time for, and you swipe it on gently rather than in a quick circular motion, this product still pills as you are applying it. it is a shame because the subtle color helps a lot to even out my skin tone, especially my dark circles, but the pilling is super annoying. i thought maybe the unseen sunscreen would be better so i tried that next, but it pills even worse!!!",neutral
it is more country kitchen buffet than the bacchanal. i wanted to like this because i hear such good things about this brand. it did not really do anything for my skin and it is way to sticky to use under make up. i would still try other products from this brand though based on the people who rave about it and how affordable it is,negative
"not good if you have the slightest dry skin. this product highlighted my dry patches and did not reduce the redness of my acne that much. i could see where this would be a good primer though, due to the texture.",neutral
pretty disappointed i wanted to love it... first off in no way is this a gel it is definitely a cream. second if you have oily skin this is not the product for you!!! i use gel and oil free moisturizers as i have acne prone oily skin and non oil free products always because me to break out. this is not oil free and i should have read more into that. i feel like this is probably a great product for someone with dry skin. with that being said i would highly recommend for oily acne prone skin ladies to steer clear of this.,negative
"i have been using it for about a month and i have not seen drastic or to be honest changes at all did not see what it claims to do. its a good light moisturizer. did not break me out. however, for those with dry skin or combo skin who needs moisture from within this may not be for you. also, if you are someone who likes to see how much product you have used, this will definitely not help.",neutral
"this is similar to the once holy grail of vitamin c before it became trendy skinceuticals ce ferrulic. this product is a fraction of the price of the other. vitamin c in high doses helps with redness from sun damage and can possibly help with brown discoloration though hydroquinone works much better. at this strength you would want to use it more for spot treatment or to mix just a drop with moisturizer, no more. it is just too strong and can cause a breakdown of skin integrity causing acne in those prone to it read the research not the advertising or the reviews based on advertising. vitamin c is oxidizing and this is not always good for skin. if i had paid better attention to the strength of this product i would have skipped it. i will not be buying again- this just is not necessary for my needs.",negative
"i would finally found a skincare routine that worked, but i had a sample of this product i thought i would try. i kept wondering why i would broken out all of a sudden and realized this was the culprit. problem was fixed when i switched to origins willow herb cleanser.",negative
i did not like it. it really did not help my breakouts!,negative
"love this cleanser! i really did notice a difference when i switched to this, my face was clear and my skin looked so smooth. it is a win in my book!",positive
i did not mind wearing these at night because they were not uncomfortable but they did peel up a little form the edges with the movement of my face. i did see results the following morning but not anything that lasted til the next day.,neutral
"i am dark-skinned, between fitzpatrick type and. this sunscreen is phenomenal and it leaves zero cast. it initially looks like it will leave a cast upon applying, but after rubbing it in it leaves a dewy glow. the price point is steep, but other than that. i am a fan!",positive
"i have tried to use this countless times and i just cannot make it work. when i used it, i got a tiny bumps all over my face. i tried to push through because i figured my face was purging, but the bumps had never went away. after using this i was scared to try the luna oil, but i decided to give it a go and i love it so much!",negative
"i loved this product when i got a sample of it, but per another review i took a closer look at the ingredients and sure enough, polyethylene was listed. this is plain old plastic. you do not want it on your face or in your sewers and septic. it is an environmental disaster so that is a hard pass for me.",negative
my am routine consists of the marine hyaluronics this moisturizer. my makeup glides on so much better! it is a thicker substance so give it time to dry before applying moisturizer.i have a lot of hyperpigmentation and this has definitely helped with brightening my skin.,positive
"like many have said, this product does not absorb into your skin, and that is why it leaves a glow. it sits on top of your skin and creates a sheen, so of course it will appear dewy. is it really hydrating if it is not absorbed though? this product got all over my eyes because it slips. no thank you.",negative
"i would not say i have sensitive skin, but this product broke me out. my face is also less smooth and radiant after using this. i will say that this bottle lasts a long time. i am trying to use it up to get my moneys worth and it is taking forever.",negative
very thin and watery formula. it feels nice on the skin but it does not hydrate enough. i feel like i have to layer other products over this to achieve moisturized skin.,neutral
"this smells so bad. literally like rubbing rotten eggs on your face. it is absolutely putrid. the texture is fine and it tends to soak it pretty well but the smell is insane. i had to use a pretty citrusy lotion afterward just to cover the smell so i could sleep at night. it is just so gross. i tried this for a week but i cannot stomach the scent anymore, i am trashing it.",negative
"this is just my personal experience- i used up the entire jar, however, it did nothing to me...just smells pretty good. i will not purchase it again",negative
"i love all things youth to the people! this mask really a moisturizer is nice and thick, the ingredients are fantastic, their company ethos is so good to people and the planet, and they are cruelty-free! a quick google search of any brand will tell you if they are actually cruelty-free, do not just trust what a company says on its site, there are very loose rules about a company being able to claim they are cf on their marketing material. my dry skin is replenished and super soft in the morning. not sure how it would work for combo or oily skin, but they do offer lighter moisturizers that i have not tried. i remove makeup with farmacy green clean, wash with yttp cleanser or milk makeup milk cleanser and finish with this or tatcha dewy skin cream which i feel is even thicker than dream mask i recently moved to chicago from california and learned for the st time what winter can do to skin! finding this mask has solved the problem. if i am having a low-key no makeup day, i will even wear it in the am.",positive
this is such a nice product. my skin started feeling firmer after about two weeks. it looks smoother and people have definitely noticed. great product.,positive
"this is refreshing, yes, but in my opinion it smells like cleaning products. it has a smell similar to that of pine sollysol which is pretty much the only downside. the smell, and this is a rarity, is enough for me to discontinue use. it is not that i would not necessarily recommend this, i just think there is better out there. if you can overlook the smell, then good on ya.",neutral
"i really wanted to love this oil the first time i used it i noticed the strong smell and still decided to try it, after noticing skin getting worse by getting bumps i stopped. tried it again and same thing. this smells really disgusting and did not work for my skin.",negative
"i received the sample size in my sephora order and was completely blown away by this product! i used it right after exfoliating in the evening and fell in love immediately. it was a very soft hint of lavender making it perfect for my bedtime routine. i am used to using a thicker moisturizer, so next time i will not pick up as much on my finger. a little goes a long way as this melts into your skin so smoothly. i have combooily acne prone skin and this did not feel greasy or slimy at all! my skin immediately felt soothed after exfoliating and toning and it felt calming. i will definitely be picking up a full size of this!",positive
i was so excited to try this product. i bought this instead of the spray water that i originally wanted. the reason i give this stars is because it is very uneven. and when it would wear off there is patches on certain areas of the skin. when it set in it would give me sort of an orange looking tone. especially make sure that when you mix it with your moisturizer wash you are hands right after or will give you a stain. that will not come off for days. as you can see i have had this on my hand for days now.,negative
"i love this facial cleanser. a little goes a long way so this bottle will last forever!! it goes on the face like a thick gel almost feels as if i am applying a mask, but as you rub it in more and more it foams up and you can literally feel it cleaning your pores. my skin is already clearer after just one week of use!",positive
"got this in exchange for bi points. i have normal to dry skin so, i usually use the tatcha dewy skin cream at night since it is very hydrating and helps with water loss. when i tried this product, it instantly started to pill on my face i also noticed that it is way too thick for normal to dry skin types and that it would just sit on my face instead of absorbing into my skin. it may work if your on the oilier side. sorry but this is a pass for me.",negative
"compared to other products i have tried, unfortunately this product is simply mid level. there is not anything special about it that stands out. it feels like any standard cream without any wow factor.the main thing that stands out to me is the lack of smell. as a face cream, there should be little to no smell and this product is the absolute best i have used for that. i had a very slight pleasant smell but honestly i am very impressed by the lack of smell. i would not buy this product because unfortunately it does not seem to do anything except moisturize and i have twenty products for that. also the packaging lists the ingredients in another language and i had to look up each ingredient to make sure it was safe. i would not recommend this product, i felt very meh about it unfortunately. it works, but i feel like something simple like the same lotion i put on my legs would work the same.",neutral
very good cleanser for acne! the cereve one is a tad cheaper so i went back to that one but i love this!,positive
"i would love to give this stars- it goes on well and is not greasy. however it does not provide protection! we got this for our trip to england. several times we were only out an hour, had applied this sunscreen generously and we all still got burned faces. such a disappointment! i cannot advise this for any real sun protection.",negative
"i first got this sunscreen in the sephora sun sampler, and then went and bought two more on the ptr site! truly the best sunscreen i have used. i have oily skin and medium skin tone and this is great. there is no white casts, it is dewy but can easily be made matte with a little powder. it works wonderfully under makeup and other products and has never pilled on me. i tried all the other sunscreens in the sampler pack and this is by far the best one. the price is definitely steep, but i am willing to pay that price for a product that i actually want to put on my face. this is not like a white, sticky, smelly sunblock that you dread putting on. you will not even know it is on and you can easily reapply in seconds and not have to put in elbow grease to avoid that whitegrey look. if you are on the fence and reading reviews to decide, just get it!",positive
"i am a big huda fan so i was super wishful for this product to work miracles. ultimately, i was disappointed. you literally have to use a huge amount of the product to actually be able to rub it into a scrub. i have used it about times it is already halfway done. it caused irritation that followed with breakouts, sad to say not worth the hype.",negative
"i really wanted to love this product, but i do not. i wanted to try and stick it out and continue to use it but i could not. i used the product day and night light instructed and every morning i woke up with a white head. typically my skin is extremely sensitive, i do get acne from stress dh school and i am years old. this product make more acne appears, i got the little bumps that show when my skin does not like a product all over my face and it itched, really bad. i think that if my skin was not so sensitive then this product would have been amazing. for me it was not the serum itself had a strong smell and was also very tacky on my skin and never seemed to absorb as well as provide the amount of moisture it claimed. i only used for a few days because it did not make sense to use it longer due to the reactions i was having. i never once saw a change.",negative
i did not notice this did much. everyone is different though so try it- the price is excellent.,neutral
"goop beauty gifted me this product. i was really excited to try this because i love a good exfoliator. upon opening it, the packaging is not anything super amazing but i think that is part of the appeal, that it is naturalclean looking. i was really expecting a pretty decent smell but it actually smells pretty chemically. i asked my husband to smell and give me his first impression and he said to him it smelled like windex. i feel like the smell could definitely be better. as far as actually using it, it did make my skin super soft and smooth! it did not dry me out but still got rid of a lot of old skin it seemed. however, i do have to say this was not a life changing micro exfoliator. i would not pay the price tag on this because it really seems like you are only paying for the name that goes with it. i will use what i have left but will not repurchase.",neutral

"moisturized my face great did not leave my face feeling oily i like the overall feel of it, but what i do not recommend is the smell of it is horrible. my boyfriend actually commented that my face smelt like puke, and i can no longer get over now that stuck with me, i can smell it in the container and it does have a terrible smell, very unfortunate because it feels like a good product but definitely not worth the money.",neutral

"i loved my previous moisturizer, absolutely nothing wrong with it and it is probably the best moisturizer i have ever used. it soaked on my face in seconds, made my skin look very radiant, and made my face feel supple. but i ran out and decided to try something new which now i feel stupid for doing so. i bought this having pretty high expectations from the reviews and hearing about what a great brand drunk elephant is.this product is pretty meh. i have been using it for almost two weeks now hoping that i will see some change. but nothing! the most annoying thing is that after put it on i hate the way my skin looks. my skin does not look soft and supple and it is like my pores are emphasized. i keep comparing it to my previous moisturizer because my skin would always look beautiful seconds after putting it on. radiant and pores diminished. you get what you pay for, i suppose. my skin does feel hydrated and soft. one pump gets my face, neck, and chest. which is great it goes so far. i feel like i just have to keep rubbing it in till it soaks in. this product does not soak in immediately. i know on the packaging it mentions use with their oil, i am wondering if that creates the miraculous results it claims. short story if you are looking for a simple product to just hydrate and nothing else this is for you.",negative
this made my skin red sting so badly! i felt like my skin was on fire i had to take it off right away,negative
"i believe for the price and product amount there are definitely better alternatives for both cheaper prices and stronger results like benzoyl peroxide spot treatment for neutrogina. it dries earthed quickly but results do not come quickly. glad i gave it a try however, will be sticking to other spot treatments in the future.",neutral
awful smell and did not do anything helpful for my face.,negative
"do not have sensitive skin, but this gave me a huge painful red and bumpy rash",negative
"i was not sure what to expect from this product but i ended up loving it! it is a large jar with a lot of product and a little goes a long way, so it is really worth the price. i put it on at night before going to sleep and when i woke up i noticed that my skin looked super hydrated, plump, youthful, and glowing. i did notice it also soothed where my skin was red and felt like my skin looked smoother and like it had less texture the next day. it also does not really have a scent so if you are sensitive to that this product is great. overall a great product!",positive
i have been using this product nightly for weeks now. i enjoy the smoothness and the slight tingle i get. a little product goes a long way which i love! i guess i have noticed a little sidfeeence in my complexion but honestly i am not sure i can tell much of a difference. product received complimentary for testing purposes,neutral
"i love this cream. it is thick, emollient and hydrating. i wish my sample was full sized. it is fragranced, so if you are sensitive to that, it may bother you. it is thick but absorbed well.",positive
i did not buy this because of the price but they gave me a big enough sample to use for a few weeks. it definitely helped even out my forehead wrinkle and did not burn or tingle me at all and usually i have very sensitive skin. for almost though i am gunna pass. it is not that amazing.,neutral
"i like that it removes everything smoothly, but it has made my face way too dry. also it has an unpleasant scent, like a lemon scented floor cleaner. probably better for oily skin types.",negative
"this sunscreen is fantastic. i have tried the other tatcha sunscreen and loved the way it made my skin feel, but i just needed a bit more protection my skin is a lot more sensitive since being indoors so much from the pandemic. it is a nice, smooth powdery finish, and unlike the sister product it does offer a bit of color for my skin so i can go out with just this and no makeup. it does have a strange clay smell, but it is not overwhelming. the bottle design leaves a bit to be desired, especially when their other product comes in such a handy tube. when you shake this, as instructed, it can bubble out of the applicator tip so definitely be aware of product spilling over.",positive
"overall, i found this to be a great essence. it left a clean and smooth finish, with my skin feeling hydrated and not tight like other essences i have used. i received a trial size but would be open to investing in a full size to see long term gains over time.",positive
wanted to love this product based on the reviews i was expecting it to work well. unfortunately this product does not absorb into skin at all. even with a micro-needle derma roller. it does give the skin a glow but that is about all it does. i rubbed my face an hour after applying it to find what i thought was dead skin rubbing off so i exfoliated the next time and had the same issue. it was not dead skin. it was the product. if you are looking for a sephora vit c serum that works then i recommend drunk elephant. i should have reordered that one but wanted to try another highly raved about product so i ordered this one. do not waste your money unless you are only looking for a aesthetically pleasing product to take photos of and post on instagram.,negative
i was initially really excited to try this because i would only heard good things about the brand. first of all the smell is god-awful and lasts nearly all day. i already have oily skin and within weeks i had like five pimples and immediately stopped using.,negative
"received this as a gift. i like the values behind the brand but did not see much of a result with my concerns. just hit with minimal fine lines but want something preventative along with dark circles no product ever really helps there because of the packaging, you think you are putting on something that is worth it! wears well under makeup, and after application it appears smooth but nothing that lasts. would recommend to someone a bit younger",neutral
"great product for the price, very easy to absorb on dry skin and makes my dry texture look smoother. but it does smells like nail remover when applying. if you do not like that it might not be it for you.",positive
good for people with sensitive skin. does not break me out and is on the cheaper side. i did not notice much difference in my skin after using it though.,neutral
"i was trying to find a new clean cleanser from sephora. i have combination oily, acne prone skin. i heard about this product from the youtuber hyram. i bought the full sized and used it for about two weeks. my skin started to have dry patches and would flake off. my skin became really dry when i usually have more oily skin in my t-zone. my t-zone started to become congested and i started to get little pimples and clogged pores. i love how this company is very eco-friendly and conscious about the environment, but this cleanser was too drying for me. i would recommend getting the smaller size before purchasing the whole thing.",negative
"this broke me out i bought one of the fresh holiday sets last year to try out the brand and started to use the rose toner in the summer as i ran out of my current toner. i started noticing i was getting acne on the perimetersides of my face but i thought it was just hormones or mask-acne since wearing masks became mandatory everywhere in canada. but after switching from going to work in the summer to staying at home back in school, i was not wearing masks as much anymore maybe once every week or two compared to everyday but still getting break outs. i decided to stop using this and the soy fresh wash out of suspicion that is the fresh products and noticed my acne disappearing and calming down the day after. i am usually ok with fragrances and ingredients such as rose but this did not work for me. before day after not using the toner the rednessacne calm down.",negative
not sure how i feel. i wanted to love this i seemed to after the first wash but it seems to have broken me out. little pimples i do not have acne like this! maybe it takes time but do not think i will repurchase,negative
solid lactic acid serum. it is good for everyday use and gentle on the skin. my face looks clearer and brighter when i use it. this is a very gentle lactic acid so do not expect dramatic results. largest drawback is the smell.,positive
"i gave this stars due to i have not tried it yet but considering return it... it was leaking before i opened it,the little box was already oily when i got it. either it was damaged or the package is not well designed. and there are some black dirty spots on the rolling ball,you could sort of see it from the attached photo evenit is not very clearly showed. it looks like used or someone did open it or droped it before... if it is brand new, i cannot imagine what kind of production environment it has. how could a brand new product packaged so poorly and dirty?very disappointed!",negative
"um where has this been my whole life?! i have tried sooo many different moisturizers and none can top this. i have been using it a couple days now, and the instant change in my skin is amazing. i woke up this morning with my skin feeling baby smooth and refreshed. not to mention my redness almost gone. i have combo skin, that has a tendency to get stressed with exfoliation and masks throughout the week. and this has actually worked from the start! there is not really a scent which is nice. it goes on smooth, with a consistency between a regular moisturizer and a cream. it melts into your skin without leaving behind product in top of your skin. it is works well under makeup too. i will definitely be repurchasing this when this bottle is out. so wonderful!",positive
i like the color this gives my skin but the bottle is not user friendly. it is hard to pump and to spray my legs i need to be able to twist and turn the bottle. when you do that it stops spraying and starts leaking. a little disappointing and i do t think i would buy again unless they change the design.,neutral
"super hydrating and pampering. i love how my skin feels in the morning after so silky, plump, and smooth!",positive
"i followed the instructions and used it times in consecutive days and then lower it down to times per week. i have relatively small face and it lasted for and half month. and i do not always apply full face. it feels cool, smells pleasant, and i can see that it does clear my skin. but that is about it. would not repurchase it again.",neutral
this stuff is so nice on your skin. i have noticed it takes your redness away. i try to put this under my eyes as well just because i have dark circles and they seem to be working. i love the smell of this product also.,positive
wanted to love this as i am obsessed with the eye cream and face cream but soap works better than the cleanser. i had to wash my face when i got out of the shower to get the rest of my makeup off. i will stick with my kiehls or glam glow.,neutral
"fortunately, i only have very small pockmarking from acne near my jawline that seems to have been there forever. unfortunately, i have not seen much of a reduction in that, but perhaps it is because it is only been about weeks and full results take about weeks. it does seem a bit silicone-heavy, which gives it a thick primer-like consistency that will fill in scars to immediately minimize the looks of scarsimperfections. i tend to have acne prone skin and this has clogged pores and it should not as it is non-comedogenic or broken me out. i wish they had a larger oz version in a tube as i am not a fan of pumps as i actually like to use this as a sort of blurring primer on it is own without makeup.",positive
helped my baggy under eyes and dark circles sooo much! i have been using this for a month now and noticed such an amazing difference!!!,positive
genuinely shocked and happy with this cleanser. super smooth and not sticky at all. so excited to keep using!!,positive
i was skeptical of this product since others have claimed to be color correcting but end up looking crazy on my pale skin. this is the first one that has not made me look either ill or orange. it definitely takes away the redness and makes my skin look dewy and fresh.,positive
got this for dry skin around eyes. it actually made it worse and more flaky. very strange since it feels very moisturizing.,negative
this product only works well if its properly applied. i used it with handa to rub on my face. that is absolutely wrong and never worked i had extra- bottles that i never wanted to throw. so i tried a different method. i bought a face massager kit from walmart. i put- drops on my and started massaging with the massager and it worked well. after massaging for couple of minutes you will see a new shine on your face that lasts for few hours you do not even need to put on make up. skin start feeling light and smooth.,positive
this is the best moisturizer out there. i have dry skin so this is perfect for me. i love the fresh feeling when it hits your skin and beautiful color.,positive
"this product seemed to help with puffiness but as far as dark circles, which is my main concern, it did not do much for me.",negative
"i am in my late s and am a sunday riley convert- i really love what this line of products has done for my complexion! that being said, i was a bit surprised by this new moisturizer. it is very thick and could be much too heavy if you use very much. personally i use a very small amount and rub it between my fingers before putting it on so that i get a smooth application. it is very hydrating, but a little sticky. it is fabulous for nighttime, but it might be a bit too thick and sticky for wearing under makeup during the day.",positive
"this feels heavy on my skin. i am normally super dry, but this makes my skin feel greasy and oily. i have only used it a couple nights. maybe i will change my mind. for now, it makes me feel moisturized, but greasy.",neutral
"i decided to give this a try during a sale and i am so glad i made the purchase. this serum is incredibly gentle yet one of the most effective vitamin c serums i have ever used. the texture is unlike most serums i have used. it is like a lightweight gel, but when applied it feels like an oil despite being oil free. it completely absorbs within minutes and leaves behind a smooth silky feel. i especially appreciate this since it is silicone free!. i apply it at night and by morning my skin is softer, smoother, more even toned and surprisingly less oily than usual. it has helped enormously with the amount of acne i typically have. it has kept breakouts at bay. i am looking forward to continuing this to see if it helps with dark spots and scars. i am so pleased with the overall appearance of my skin!",positive
"absorbs quick and clean, just did not see any effects. but for the price you should try it.",neutral
i received this product complimentary from peter thomas roth. this is a beautiful moisturizer. the texture feels incredible. i have super dry skin and i am sad to say this is not enough to keep my skin hydrated all day long. it absorbs quickly but other than the texture i would have to unfortunately pass. maybe it will work better in the summer time for my dry skin. we will have to see. it will probably work well with my normal skim friends,neutral
"i have issues with collagen products as they normally break me out with blemishes. however, this lovely sleeping night pack from algenist is made with marine collagen, not piggy collagen, so does not because any blemishes or breakouts. i have oily skin and this is quite rich",positive
"so bad. it broke me out like crazy, do not waste you are money just go with the hero cosmetic lightening wand.",negative
"highly underrated product! i am so surprised more people are not talking about this. the price is a bit steep, but it lasts a really long time! i have had it for about two months and have barely made a dent. at first it seemed like it was drying me out, but i hung in there and wow! my skin has been so smooth and it is definitely been fading some dullness and dark spots! will repurchase for sure.",positive
"i have used farmacys daily greens for a while was excited to try more of their products. deep sweep worked great on combating my oiliness. however, it left my skin feeling very dry once absorbed.",positive
"i have dry skin and i thought this cream would do wonders according to the raving reviews. however, this did nothing to replenish the dryness in-fact it just made my skin greasy. i returned this purchase days later.",negative
"i got a sample of this, used it twice and it broke me out so bad",negative
"i found this product to be extremely overrated. i ran out of my caudalie beauty elixir and was looking for a new facial mist to try. after reading all of the raving reviews i gave this a go. i now wish i had not. unless i spray an inch away from my face, this spray does absolutely nothing. the only upside i can think of is that it smells fruity and even so, if you are a more mature skin care enthusiast you would not appreciate it as the scent it very intensely fruity and artificial smelling. for this hefty price tag, go on and find something better. highly recommend the caudalie beauty elixir.",negative
"i have winter time eczema on my foreheadcheeks and i wanted this to work so much but it did not do much. after trialing it for a few days, it did not minimize the itching nor redness very much. the formula consistency is thick like vaseline jelly due to the petroleum jelly and an assortment of oils it is made of so it managed to covermoisturize my face well. but, my face still felt itchy when i had it on and the red patches did not seem to diminish over time. honestly, i felt like i was putting on fancy vaseline with oatmeal extract and facial oils.",neutral
"was looking for a truly moisturizing product to replace the one i have used for years. just wanted something close to that formula of hyaluronic acid and glycerin as the old product actually worked, keeping my skin moist with attracting water. water is moisture you know. oil is not. products that seal in moisture do not either. real honest to goodness moisture is water, you all.",neutral
"i loved this stuff at first, but it does not last as long as it says it should. meaning the quality product deteriorates before expected. it has a use by date of months from the date of opening. after months the product started to separate, would leave clumpsgrit feeling on the skin, and would not mix back together. i guess if you use it every day and before the month time period, i would recommend it, but make sure to use it before...probably even before months after purchase. i probably will not purchase again just because i do not use it fast enough to justify throwing half of it away.",neutral
this cream was really nice the first few times but as i continued using it it was not enough at all. it has a nice texture and no fragrance but it just was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. it is a nice cream but nothing phenomenal. i do not think it is worth the price.,neutral
"amazing! i have lupus and get the butterfly rash on my face, this really helps soothe and keeps me hydrated.",positive
"i bought this to give it a try, but did not have high hopes. i am so impressed! the formula is so lightweight, and so easy to use. after a few days of consistent use morning and night, i noticed my skin was visibly less dull-- maybe even a little glowy.",positive
this was gifted by tatcha but it is such a good product! i have extremely oily skin and this definitely helped to combat some of that oiliness snd made my makeup go on so smooth afterwards. i was very impressed. my skin felt very smooth afterwards.,positive
"i used bottles of this already. it looks like a very good formula and sits well on the face. honestly, it does nothing though. no glow or fading of spots.",negative
this product is nice. its soft and it does what it says it does. it feels interesting in my opinion and while it is nice it is not a product you necessarily need if you have a face wash with gentle microbeads like the neutrogena water one in the blue bottle. i only have give it stars because i feel the price is high for the amount of product. on the opposite side of things do not need to use a lot product and will last a while. overall it is okay but it did not impress me much. this was given to for review thru influenster!,neutral
i know this product is super popular but to be honest i do not get all the hype. it was ok. my skin felt super dry afterwards though and it definitely did not remove my makeup. i received this product free for testing.,negative
love this moisturizer! i have typically combo skin but also have super dry and super oily spots on my face so finding a moisturizer that balances that is hard but this one is perfect!! it feels so lightweight yet it gives the hydration i need without it being greasy during the day! so good!,positive
"this toner did not improve my complexion as much as sa toners i have used. not terrible, but not effective enough for stubborn pimples.",neutral
i used this twice a day over the course of a year did not do a thing for my skin or fine lines. save your money.,negative
"i purchased this, was not a gift from alpyn. first off, i have to mention the smell. hooooo boy! i have used skinceuticals vitamin c hot dog smelling serum and the crazy salad dressing smelling p lotion, so i am no stranger to strong smelling skincare. but man, there is something about the smell of this serum that i just do not if i can handle. it is super pungent and instantly makes my face scrunch up in distaste, i do not know how to describe it. that being said, it feels nice and i like the finish. is it making any changes in claritytexturebrightness of my skin after a month of use? eh, i do not know. nothing dramatic enough that i can perceive. i will probably finish the bottle, that is, if i can muscle through the smell..... but will not be repurchasing.",neutral
"best eye cream i have ever tried, hands down! makes my eyes look refreshed and rejuvenated. helps with dark circles too. helps with my fine lines and makes it look like better! definitely recommend this eye cream for dry and aging skin.",positive
"i used this cleanser for nearly months and while it is not bad or horrible by any means, it does not really do anything. it works just as well to remove makeup as every other cleanser i have ever used, and it did not do anything to improve my skin either. it is just meh, for the price they are charging you can easily find something much cheaper that accomplishes the exact same things. there is a mild scent of cantaloupe and for some reason it made me gag, but after the first days i stopped noticing the smell. bottom line it is not bad, but there really is not any reason to buy it.",neutral
reeks of drugstore fake tanner which made me nervous but i slapped it on anyway and it was so uncomfortably greasy i had to wash it off.,negative
i really liked the way this serum felt on my skin during and afterwards. it did not make me look super oily but just gave me a dewy look. but.. it had a really weird smell to it and it caused me to get little bumps on my forehead. i probably will not be using this in my routine anymore.,neutral
"i really like the look of this on, but unfortunately it clogs my pores really badly. i end up with a face full of acne the next day even after a double cleanse.",neutral
"i love this clay mask, it is one of the best that i have tried. i have combo sensitive skin and this mask removes excess oil without over drying me out. i use this once or twice a week and i have noticed that it has helped reduce the severity of my hormonal acne.",positive
"i do not love this product nearly as much as i wanted to, unfortunately! this left my skin feeling unusually sensitive, even after following the directions to only leave on for a few minutes. i also do not find the product application process to feel that great either- the mask has a gritty texture. even though this was gifted by tatcha to me, it is a pass for me.",negative
"as much as i love murad this product disappointed me. the formula was greasy a little thick and hard to spread on my face. after the product would sink into my skin i noticed that where i applied the product i would it would leave flakes in my hairline, under my neck jawline i would constantly have to rub the product off with a towel. the upside is that it did mattify my skin and make my pores look smaller and my skin clearer, but i overall did not like the feel of it on my skin.",neutral
"the only good thing i have to say is the packaging was very luxurious. otherwise, this product was awful. i have tried a lottttt of cleansers and only a few i felt did not clean my skin, this is one of them. the formula is soooo thin, it feels like you are just rubbing water in your face. you do not feel clean at all afterwards. i broke out moreeee with this product. i tried it for a solid month a day, i still had of the bottle left but i cannot use it up, i do not like it at all.",negative
"save your money! i am highly disappointed by this product, if i am being honest, i feel robbed. i am more than half way through the bottle and have seen zero results, not even a little bit. no brightening, no tightening, nothing!in fact, it caused a few clogged pores. if you are looking for an amazing vitamin c serum or brightening power, i highly recommend clinique vitamin c booster or vitamin c powder cleanser.",negative
"this is a heavy, rich creme like a diaper cream or mayonnaise consistency which takes awhile to absorb in the eye area. probably best used as a night cream and for dry skin types. because i have combooily, acne-prone, sensitive skin, it is a tad too much for me but it works fine.",neutral
"i have dry-combination skin that is reactive to spf. this product was no exception. i would get one to two large cystic breakouts per week from using this. seemed to provide good uv coverage and stay on nicely when being active outdoors, but was not worth the acne. if sunscreen never breaks you out, then maybe this would be ok for you. classic silicone feel when applying.",negative
"i really love this cream- however when i bought the refill it did not fit properly inside the original moisturizer case, it does not screw in properly and the pump no longer works and a bunch of product was wasted even trying to get it to fit. of course they were un able to replace the original case because it was purchased over days ago, but this is because i thought i would only need to keep buying the refills moving forward to be eco friendly, however upon my first attempt to refill this has happened. considering the price i am very unhappy with this.",negative
"the scent is strong, like a mix of citrus and toilet cleanser. i could have tolerated that, but this cream made all my other skincare pill up underneath and create a heavy film in spots. i rotate a ton of different moisturizers over that same skincare routine and have never had this happen! it initially feels almost balmy and melts into almost an oil, so a little goes a very long way, but despite the oily feel, my skin became drier the longer i used it, and eventually started to feel rough and dehydrated. it never dries down, so wearing makeup over it did not work well at all. lastly, keep it far away from the eye area, especially if used at night...if it migrates into the eye, it stings. i wanted to love this so much, but i just could not. for reference, i have drymature skin.",negative
this product sat on the surface of my skin like a slick and never was absorbed. it smells horrible but looks pretty in the bottled. it went back. bleck,negative
i wanted to love this. it kind of blurs your lines in a way when applying but i did not notice a big difference in my over all skin. i tried it for over a month.,neutral
"i have been using this product for about weeks, it has made the skin dryer darker under my eyes, and the line appear deeper. i have read this happens at first with retinol so i will give it another few weeks reevaluate again. a positive is i have not found it irritating, which is great considering i have sensitive skin.",neutral
"the product itself was ok but one of my masks was thicker than the other and i was not able to keep it in place. the packaging also needs a bit of work if you are not careful you can rip the mask. overall the mask was ok, for the price it is not anything to complain about. i did not see a difference using it but the product felt nice and i will purchase again if i need to hit a purchase amount limit to qualify for a deluxe sample.",neutral
"the actual consistency and smell of this product is nice, it soaks in quickly and does not make me greasy. with that being said, i cannot apply this to my face for another day. the skin around my nose and on my chin is so red and raw, it constantly burns. i do not have the most sensitive skin either, so maybe it just does not like the ingredients in this one. i wish i did not throw out the box because i would definitely be returning",negative
"love this product! easy to use, amount of color is gradual and stays for a few days! i do not sit in the sun but love a bronze glow!",positive
"it is fair to say that on every product you try consistency is key!. specially with skincare. after almost days of trying this product every night, i have to say i am amazed on how hydrating it is! best of all it does not leave my skin looking greasy. i also paired this with their liquid collagen serum. i leave every product i apply dry a bit first before moving to the next one, i tend to press doing upward movements some nights i use my jade roller, once you apply this thick consistency cream it melts like butter!!. when i wake up in the morning i feel my skin more hydrated it is softer, brighter, glowing. it has a buttery texture, but it is light and absorbs quickly.i am so happy i was able to try this product, it will definitely be my next purchase once it finishes. it will last for a couple of months because a little goes a long way. i have received this product complimentary for testing, but my opinions and reviews are my own. algenist influenster",positive
i was really impressed by this eye cream. it has lessens the dark circles under my eyes every morning. i use at night after washing my face with the yttp cleanser. you only need a small amount to dab under and around your eye. i would definitely recommend for improving dark circles.,neutral
"amazing!!! my holy grail!!! it is super lightweight, makes your skin glow, and smooths out the texture of your face. definitely seen a difference with this product.",positive
"i wish this product had existed years ago. i have noticed a huge difference in how quickly my embarrassing acne dark spots dissipate following a breakout. i also have sun spots that i have noticed start to go away after a few weeks of use. my skin looks and feels brighter. the texture of the product is soothing and spreads nicely. i like the dispenser, you get every last drop possible out of the bottle. i hate wasting when i can see product but not get it out of the bottle.",positive
i received this complementary in my voxbox from influenster and i absolutely loved it! as soon as i put it on my skin was softer and smoother. i would definitely purchase this item again.,positive
"i am a huge tatcha fan, but this was a miss for me. i live in a very dry climate and have very dry skin so thought this would be a good fit. pros for me- i love the tatcha smell, and this is the same as their whole line. i think you either love or hate the smell. it is thick a luxurious cream. however, the cons outweigh the pros for me. the cream would be a great night cream, but i do not really need eye creams. it does not absorb into the skin as others have said, so it is fine for bed with no make up, but definitely cannot wear eye makeup with this or could be problematic if you wear contacts. also, i do not feel it actually did much. all my other tatcha products i feel work for my skin.. but this kind of just sat there on my eyes mocking me of how much i spent on it. i will not return it, and will continue to use at night.. but i do not be buying again. sorry tatcha.",neutral
"i love to products. this one is good for hydrating and did not irritate my skin, but it just did not wow me like some of their other products. product sank into skin quickly but i feel like the hydration did not last that long for me. i will admit that i have finicky skin so a lot of moisturizing products fall short for me. add hormonal acne and wearing a mask for hr shifts to the mix and things that may have worked before will not now.",neutral
"works well for removing light make up, it is a balm so it runs out pretty fast.",positive
"i received this product to review. initially i was very excited but as time goes on, i find myself reaching for it less and less. i always double cleanse anyway, so i would still wash my face with a cleanser after using this to remove my makeup light makeup, nothing heavy. i have found that more often than not if i am using this consistently i can expect to have a breakout. especially when you consider the price, there are better, more affordable micellar waters out there.",neutral
"in love! every time i put this on-- my skin immediately feels supple, soft, plump, and refreshed! i have found myself using it to rehydrate-- and the smell is divine!",positive
this broke me out with cystic acne. i have not had acne in years but this was the only thing new in my routine. it also broke out my teenager with a lot of white heads.,negative
this is my rd purchase of this stuff! it works so well as a moisturizer and i even use it under my makeup during the day to help my skin stay dewy. definitely a permanent in my skincare no mater the am or pm!,positive
"a good cleanser, although a little drying. this definitely caused a purging period for me and my skin was very bumpy and rough on my t-zone and chin areas which is not typical for me. unfortunately i did not see a lot of payoff afterwards. i was a little put-off by the sticker on the front of the tube that covered up azelaic acid and was replaced by bha, not sure why they did that. i would not recommend for hormonal acne but i would recommend if your main issues are blackheadswhiteheads.",neutral
love the package for starters so small and compact and love the pink color and the way it is made is almost like a lipstick. easily applies but not sure if it did anything but i will keep using,neutral
"this is the second time i have purchased this product because my favourite oil control moisturizer was discontinued from ole henriksen. i thought i would give it another try. i am very disappointed because this does nothing for my skin. it makes it very oily and pores are not tightened at all. for this price, i expected more. i also have tried the powder and primer from this brand and they were both not great. with the high reviews and high prices, i was expecting better quality.",negative
i love this mask. i love very much. absolutely recommend. it is for good dry skin. a must have in my daily skin care routine,positive
"it is so hard to find a face oil which smells this great, like actual roses. that is why i rarely use face oil until this. packaging is so elegant and it is easy to use. loveeeeeee",positive

"let me start off by saying when i do not wear any makeup and cleanse my face with this oil cleanser, it is really nice and feels great. my skins looks fresh afterwards. however, to call this a makeup removing oil cleanser is just false. when i wear makeup and use only this cleanser to remove it, i have makeup left all over my eyes and face. for this reason, i had to give it stars. i do not wear makeup often, so i will continue to use it, but anytime i do wear makeup i will take a makeup removing wipe to my face first before i use this.",neutral
"i was introduced to alpha-h years ago by a beautician while living in australia. this brand will always be one of my favourites, they have so many amazing products!i really like this cleanser. it cleans every speck of dirt and makeup off my skin. as i have combination skin i need a delicate balance of hydration and removing excess oil. this cleanser does the job. i do not feel tight but i feel perfectly balanced and clean. i will repurchase again for sure! cons- it tastes terrible, do not get it in your mouth!",positive
"the best serum ever- i have found my holy grail in dior capture youth plump filler serum! it has a lovely light scent, goes on smoothly, and makes your skin so soft and smooth. my under eye wrinkles have disappeared, my makeup goes on more smoothly, and i am extremely pleased! you will not regret this purchase- it is worth every cent and more!",positive

"i bought the mini size just to try it out since the full size is a bit pricey i am going to. it is decent and will make your skin smooth. however, i did not notice a huge difference since i already have several acids in my normal skin care routine. i guess my skin it used to it now? anyway, you can get acids that are just as effective at a lower price the ordinary, timeless, etc..",neutral
really small amount for the price. i do not feel like it works any better than the other acne solutions out there.,neutral
"i freaking love this moisturizer. this moisturizer and ceraves are the only ones that do not break my sensitive, acne prone skin out. i am very picky on what i use for obvious reasons, but this works and keeps my skin hydrated and soft. really helps with acne because dryness leads to more pimples. i absolutely love it, would highly recommend to any acne pronesensitive girlies and guys.",positive

"one word wow! i have such sensitive skin and i usually have irritation when it comes to vitamin c but this actually calms my irritation and i love it!! my skin has actually reduced in redness and the daily glow it gives me makes me feel so refreshed. also, super hydrating! i have been getting so many compliments on my skin since i have started using it!",positive
"i received this as a full sized product as part of a review, which i thought was super generous! unfortunately, i have been using it for the past week and have not actually noticed any change in my skin. with that being said, i do have very sensitive skin, and this has not given me any adverse reaction which i am really happy about. love the packaging, but have not seen any results as of yet.",neutral
"while i do agree this is a superb cleanser, the smell is a bit overwhelming. i would definitely recommend this though! it is very gentle on my skin and i could tell after only a few uses that my pores were visibly smaller. just be aware that, if you are sensitive to strong smells, this may not be the product for you.",positive
"this works well to breakup makeup, sunscreen, waterproof eye makeup. its one of the few oils that does not break me out. so if you are not having luck with other oil cleansers, this one is worth a try.",positive
"i love this product, unfortunately the pump malfunctioned and it is no longer usable with half the product left. will try prying the top off but when you pay a higher price for quality products, i do expect to be able to use them for the last drop. this would have been a star review, but do to the poor packaging not sure i would purchase again.",negative
"so in store when i swatched it i was amazed, but when i got home it was nothing the same. my circles under my eyes were not covered. it was mattifying which caused it to be drying on my skin and i have combo oily skin so that is weird. the color range is definitely lacking and it is soo messy! when i opened the jar it just spilt everywhere. i gave it some time to see if i changed my mind but no this just is not it for me. going to return.",negative
"do not really know what to rate this but the smell is a reason why i am glad i bought the smaller size and not the larger size. i really do not feel motivated to use it, since the smell is a bit too much for me. yikes. i cannot say if it works or not.",neutral

"while this creates a relatively even and streak free tan every time, the color is lacking even if you use more than needed. also, the color you do get is pretty orange. i have a base tan, but i would only recommend this to girls who are already tan and looking to create more of a caramel color. this clings to dry spots worse than my isle of paradise. i would only use this again in between other tanning products just to finish the bottle.",neutral
"somewhat hydrating but causes pilling with other products, especially facial oils",negative

"during the period that i tried this serum i was not able to tell any improvements on my facial appearance. the product it self is of good quality and low odor. that said, it did made my face feel itchy so it should be used with discretion specially if you are prove to cosmetic sensitivity. overall i think this is a high quality product with great properties but not effective to work in every skin type.",neutral
"i received the free complimentary sample of set the stage hydrating priming serum from lawless beauty for testing and review purposes. i started using this unique hybrid-in- serum moisturizer primer immediately and found its silky texture feeling so soft and light on my skin while the formula continuously worked, creating an invisible silk canvas for makeup, smooth, soft and subtly radiant.this unique formula silicone-free formula, with antioxidant-rich skincare ingredients, of this primer provides lightweight hydration to my skin with its soothing benefits and a subtle and calming lavender scent. the shea butter softens, hydrates, and deeply nourishes the skin without clogging the pores. this one step primer actually sets the stage for me before i am ready apply my makeup.i love using this primer so much that i have already recommended it to several of my friends and family who love to use makeup, and several of them already purchased and used it, and just love the way how this amazing primer gives a calm, smooth skin healing it all the way through. they are also happy to use this serum in their skincare routine before or after applying their moisturizer, morning and night.",positive
"non-irritating and quite hydrating for a micellar water. i do not have that dry tightening feel after using this. i am not a heavy make up wearer, but this does handle my mascara, eyeliner and spf. no real smell. i did see some inconsistencies with the opaqueness and thickness between my first and second bottle but it still worked fine.",positive

this product is just ok. the packaging is terrible. the dropper is useless. i have to shake the product out of the bottle which wastes quite a bit every time i use it. have not really noticed a difference but i am only a quarter of the way through the bottle. i probably will not purchase this again,neutral

"okay so the first two times i used it, it was amazing. however, the last time i used it it was so streaky. also it washes off in like two days.",neutral
i gave it a chance and it is just way overpriced for the quality. it is gentle on skin but it did not tan my face at all that i could tell so i returned it.,negative
"at st i was really happy with it after using it a few times. but then i started breaking out and i have not broken out in years like one on my cheek one by my nose under my chin so i am going to return it. i do not think its the product i think i just do not know what my skin type is so it would be good to know before using this because, although it is water based, apparently there some congestive components as well that can clog your pores.",neutral
"i love this stuff! i have sensitive eyes from allergens and alcohol wipes would burn my eyes, because the corners of my eyes from the rubbing, redness etc. i would use face wash to try and scrub my makeup off but end up using x the product and this just made it all easier. melts your makeup off completely, easily, does not strip your skin, and i simply wash to off after with face wash. just ordered my second bottle. i would recommend for anyone who has sensitivity to the alcohol is makeup wipes.",positive
"was so excited to try this product out, as i have been looking for a good neck cream ever since i turned! i have a few fine lines starting to become visible on my neck and used this for about weeks in my morning and nightly routine. the difference is quite drastic just yet, but i definitely see an improvement and have noticed that the lines have softened up a bit! i will continue to use it and i am sure i will see more results with consistency!",positive
i could not believe the price on this product. it is very concentrated and a little goes a long way. it has a pretty strong rose scent if that is not something you are a fan of. my face feels supple and moisturized after using it. i have had a recent breakout and not sure if this is the because. i will definitely finish the jar but cannot see myself repurchasing it.,positive

i bought this last week after being recommend by a beauty consultant. she advises me to use dewy skin cream over magic cream ct as it contained more anti-aging benefits while giving the much needed hydration during winter time. after first application my skin looks indeed very dewy and feels smooth. second day i woke up with small bumps on my right cheek third day i noticed tender bumps on the forehead fourth day on my upper lips and just today on the left cheek. i am quite disappointed with the result given the relatively high price. i gave this product three-star ratings because it indeed deliver the ultra hydrating promise. but i did not expect to get cystic acne from it which is a bummer.,neutral
"when receiving a product called moisture surge, i expect a product that is going to be bursting with long lasting hydration, and unfortunately this was not it. upon initial application, it is a nice lightweight gel moisturizer, with little to no scent that made the skin feel soft. however, not even minutes later it felt like i did not apply anything to the skin, defeating the purpose of this moisturizer",negative
this is my favorite sunscreen! not only is it clean for the environment but i love the way it feels on the skin. it goes on easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. while it is an oil it does not leave you feeling sticky at all.,positive
"this was my first de product, i was very excited. considering the price i am very disappointed. if this product was half the price i still would not repurchase. i think the packaging is interesting. the pump is great but i need less than a full pump for my face and neck. i am concerned about the pump not working one day, how do you get the cream out? i do not find that it absorbs completely, there is a residual film left. i think the cream is too thick, like crisco consistency. i have found only hours after applying my face is very shinny and to me appears greasy.",neutral
"i have really been loving this toner for morning and night use. the feeling it leaves on my skin is very luxurious. although, if you hate fragrance in your products, it does have a slight cupcake scent, which i happen to enjoy. i have noticed a visible difference in my skin after using it for just over a week.",positive
works well but is super runny. i find i go through the bottle so quickly because it is so runny. i would probably buy this again in a pinch but it would not be my first choice.,neutral

"i have quite a bit of dark spots left from pimples and they have been there from months to a year. this has definitely reduced the visibility of the dark spots, although it is not fully gone yet. then again, i have not been applying it too often. i apply it during the night because it does smell funny and is gritty. so i recommend that you use it before going to bed. i will definitely be buying this product again!",positive
"this cream is super greasy and for some reason enlarged all of my pores as soon as i put it on. looked like i had tiny little bumps all over my forehead! i really wanted to love this, but it just felt so uncomfortable on and made my skin look awful.",negative
"so, these work very well, but they are not worth the price pacth simply because they are not unique, you can buy almost the same product a good quality one from another brand for a fraction of the price. i tried these and the cheaper ones and they had exactly the same result, even though the other was not medicated. i just used some topical salicylic acid before placing the dot and voila. still, if you do not mind over paying, i recommend it.",neutral
"i think this is one of des more promising products. i think the real shining star of the brand is their marketing. i was totally suckered by all their pretty packaging and their marketing ploys. however, most of their products feel a little bit lackluster. this is fine i did not have any adverse reaction but it did not make my skin noticeably better.",neutral

"i like this cream so far. it said mochi, and i was already drawn in. my favorite thing about it is that it is fragrance free! the cream is a perfect inbetween of a rich cream and a light watery one. it gives me a nice dew and shine while keeping my skin soft. my skin is more dry and does not produce much oil, so i like this. someone with oilier skin might find this too thick still. but it might make a good night cream for others too. i usually use during the day.",positive
"feels nice, not much difference on fine lines after months of use. i find it it a little over priced. i will not buy again.",neutral

"okay product, however the packaging is an environmental disaster. admittedly beautiful, the bottle consists of clear hard plastic on the outside with two small orange plastic containers on the inside, each containing different parts of the serum that are mixed when pumped out. recyclable? hardly.in addition, you cannot effectively dispense all of the product, due to the design. there will always be about of the product left at the bottom of the inner orange containers no matter how many times you pump the dispenser, turn it upside down, or even try to dismantle it which i did- the packaging is made of such hard plastic, you cannot cut it or otherwise access a fairly substantial amount that you can see, but will always be left on the bottom.the product itself is good, but not great. you will feel a tingling sensation when you use it, suggesting that it works. unless your face is properly cleansed and toned, be careful, as you may experience breakouts with it. i have switched to using skinceuticals c e ferulic, which i am much happier with.i implore the manufacturer to rethink their packaging. if every company made products like this, the environmental repercussions would be dire.",negative

"i purchased this set. this is my new favorite sheet mask. i never use a product without analyzing the ingredients because i have very sensitive skin. i can not use retinol or other strong actives. i have to look far and wide for anti aging products that are gentle enough but actually work! these masks contain hard working anti aging and skin softening ingredients. the design is so easy to use and fit my face perfectly. there is a slight scent but it did not irritate my skin. after you remove the mask pat the serum into your skin...let it drink it up! i used a deluxe sample of jlo face cream after and woke up with baby soft skin. i have one mask left and will stock up next time. in the past i have spent much more on products that do not work as well, not even close. these are the real deal!",positive

"in my early s and have heard amazing things about this product but was super disappointed. it is great for an year old that does not really need moisturizer but not for anyone that actually needs moisturizer. not only did my face my wrinkles look worse after using for a couple weeks, i also broke out. i would not recommend to anyone.",negative
"got this in a sample packet that contained enough product for me to use four times on my face and neck, and i am so torn!!!the consistency of the toner is thicker, almost like a runny serum and does indeed hydrate as it tones and tightens. the skin on my jawline and cheeks feel tight during the dry down after applying the toner, but my skin still feels hydrated. it went under makeup really well too, and does not because any piling or shifting when makeup is applied.now for the bad part. the scent is way too strong and artificial, like a watermelon jolly-ranchers candy on steroids... i am not usually sensitive to scents as most of my skincare and hair-care products have scents and i love scented candles for the home and do use perfume. that said, this serum gave me a headache every time i used it. i really wished the perfume smells lighter and less sweet, but more fresh and just-picked watermelonmelon. all in all, if not for the heavy and cheap-smelling fragrance, i would purchase a full size as it is a nice hydrating toner that is a clean formulation without use of alcohols that can cause premature skin aging.",neutral
"i should start by saying i love everything ilia and use a few of their products. i was super excited to try this but it really did not work for me. first off, the coverage is minimal at best. it is oily and not moisturizing enough to wear alone so i had to layer with my moisturizer which then negates the tint. if i put it over the moisturizer the serum does not absorb properly. also, i had to use a lot in order to benefit from the spf at this rate it will be gone in a week. i appreciate what they were trying to do here but this is just not it.",neutral
"this product is really nice and minimizing pores by minimizing oil on my face. however, it does not try it out which is amazing! i think there are slight good changes with this product but i have not noticed a life changing difference to give stars! i think it is worth a try for the price though! beautiful packaging and well priced!",neutral
"i am giving it stars because i honestly needed something like this and this was exactly what i was looking for but... it broke me out. i have extremely sensitive skin, been on accutane, done it all, tried it all. so sad about this. going to have to return. if you are not super acne prone i would give it a try because it gives you that glowwy hydration that we all want, and it looked amazing under makeup. sad about this one",neutral

"i got a mini version as a free sample with another purchase. i really do not like this moisturizer and will not consider ever buying it. it does not absorb well at all, and it sits like a greasy sticky on the skin. i have no issue with thicker, heavier moisturizers but this just does not add any benefit of hydration because it does not actually absorb into the skin. rather than having skin look plump and dewy, it leaves skin shiny and sticky.",negative
"this product is ultra hydrating for my skin in the arid environment i live in. while i do not think it makes wrinkles and fine lines go away, i think it moisturizes do well that it prevents them from getting worse. it is thick, a little sticky, and looks oily at first, but after a few minutes it soaks in. works pretty well under my concealer too.",positive
"so i am an abs sucker for highly rated products. they draw me in. i guess this promise, the potential to find some hg is what makes skin care a multi billion dollar industry lol even knowing that price has a pretty significant impact on the placebo effect, this one drew me in. i do not mind spending a lot of money on products i will pay just about anything for a quality product that works. that is the thing though, it needs to work better than it is less expensive counterparts. this serum does not. it is not bad per se, but it is not great. there are better alternatives, some of which are substantially cheaper. it is clearly capitalizing on a few well known marketing tricks in order to charge too much for ingredients that are not special or elusive, and i am a little mad at myself for falling for it lol. and i really do not want to sound preachy, and i feel like i already kind of do, lol sorry but it helps me to just be aware, when i am sampling new, particularly expensive products, that we all tend to seeinvent better results when we have spent a lot on a product. instead of relying on my own eyeimpression, i take pics, ask loved ones without divulging the cost, in case the price induced placebo effect is transferable lol and search for objective, measurable means of assessment. so again, i am sorry if this sounds preachy but i thought maybe this tip could help someone else when sampling expensive products. because while i mean no offense to anyone else who is reviewed this product, the only explanation i can find for such universally fantastic ratings is the placebo effect. of course, we all have different skin and so this may work much better for some than others, but that still does not account for how great the reviews are across the board. anyway, point being, if you are like me and you get sucked in by well reviewed products, i would really try to resist the urge to buy this one. perhaps try the ordinarys or skinfixs, both of which have very similar ingredients and results.",negative
i had a high hope for this spf cream but i had to return this one because it was making my skin very dry. if you have an oily skin you may love this product but people with the dry skin may have a problem. i do not recommend this product if you have a dry skin.,neutral
need to give this another chance but first use was not a positive one. the only colour i saw was orange all over my hands even though i scrubbed them after using this product and could not get rid of the colour.,negative
"not a stand alone cleanser. i always need another one to strip off makeup, this one smears it around. the oil kind of burns your eyes. when using this to double cleanse you hope the oil will keep you from feeling dried out but i really did not see that with this. love this brand but not this product.",negative
i was promised a small bottle of the same but nothing came along. i hve been trying to reach the customer service but unable to. this is not fair. i need the small version that i was promised.,positive
"not a good moisturizer to wear under makeup as it pills quite badly. it is not bad at night but i would prefer something thicker, so it does not have a purpose for me really.",neutral
i have been using this for a few months but have not noticed a huge difference. it seems slightly lighter. i have had a scar on my chin from pimples since i was a teenager and nothing ever seems to help it much unfortunately. i am going to continue giving this a try!,neutral
"love love love this cleanser. got it as a birthday gift and then i had to buy the full size. it is creamy and soft and i feel like my face is really clean after wash. i recommend it to anyone who is oily like me and wants that clean feeling after washing, does not leave a residue like i feel some cleansers do",positive
"i have loved this so far! as an avid spf wearer i need something that i can apply without making my face feel gross. this product sinks into the skin without leaving any residue feel. sure it is different than other products that are more lotion like, this is a gel texture, but for me that is preferred to keep from feeling like i have a ton of layers on. great sun protection as well!",positive
i received a deluxe sample of this product from influenster and i have been applying it to my crows feet area and between my brows and i cannot believe how youthful and vibrant my skin looks now! i want to buy the full size and start using it on my whole face. highly recommend!,positive
"omg this is a miracle product. i do not get pimples very often however a couple weeks ago i got a giant one on my forehead that i obsessed over. instead of popping it, i decided to try the dot and was blown away that overnight the pimple essentially disappeared! my new favorite pimple product!",positive
"broke my oily skin out worse than it already was, and hate the smell. to me, it smelled like cheap hotel handwash.",negative
"i do like this cleanser since it really does clean well. however, it cleans a bit too well to the point of over drying. i have to moisturize very thoroughly following the use of the cleanser since my face gets super tight and dry. the packaging also sucks, it is literally impossible to get the right amount of product out and the top of my bottle broke off during my second use.",neutral
"i got a sample of this and although it is rich and moisturizing, it ended up giving me milia around my eyes and cheeks. i really wanted to like this because it is so lush but i guess my skin cannot tolerate how heavy this eye cream is.",negative
"i bought this bar as a part of the peekee juju travel duo. while i wanted to love it, this bar left my skin feeling pretty dry even after applying moisturizer right after, especially on my cheeks which tend to be drier than the rest of my face. definitely not for everyone especially if you have dryer patches on your face. i would recommend getting the trial sizes if you are unsure",neutral
i do not get it- i usually like herbivores stuff but this just does not hit. i feel like i have to apply droppers just to get properly hydrated. bummer.,negative
this stuff is amazing. it smells fantastic. it goes on smooth and soaks right into you skin. it does not leave it oily at all. i put it on under my moisturizer and have noticed a nice difference in firmness and less puffiness. def a must have.,positive
really disappointed. it looks orange and is so patchy even with really good moisturizing and exfoliation. i got the dark and honestly even max drops was not very dark at all. trashing it.,negative
it is literally so thick that it feels like i am getting wrinkles when i try to rub it in. i mean it moisturizes once it is rubbed in but it is not worth it. i also dislike the packaging because it is not very sanitary and it is bulky.,negative
pretty good skin refresh but not very potent. it does a decent job and i never broke out after this but does it really make a difference? no. there is not enough in the formula to make substantialchanges on your face.it is however a good product for a decent price. i have used it so far for weeks.,neutral
i bought this product thinking it would be gentle on my skin. i used this cleanser only one time because it stripped the oils off my skin. my face was tight afterwards. i ended up returning the product back to the store. i hope farmacy changes their formula.,negative
"no matter how many different moisturizers i try, i always come back to this one. it is great for the summer since i get oily around my t zone area. i get dry patches in the winter so this is great for when my skin changes back to oily.",positive
no difference in dark spots. not worth the buy. the dropper does not even work,negative
"i got a complimentary sample from influenster. i was super excited to try this out because i have never tried anything from this brand. i was honestly super disappointed. apart from hyaluronic acid, i did not see any other ingredients that would considerably improve my skin. also, the consistency was kind of sticky and too oily, which made me breakout. i will not buy this again. it did not work on my face but i have been using it on my cuticles and it is really nice",negative
"beautiful color, goes on evenly no streaks. lasts about- days. i know you are not supposed to use it on your face but i put it on mine and it made my skin break out pretty bad. also caused some breakouts on my arms and legs. not a huge deal considering it has happened with other tanners but until i find a self tanner that does not because me to break out and has color as good as this one, the st. tropez classic is for sure my favorite.",positive
"wow! i absolutely loved testing the rich cream. my skin felt so hydrated after i used it. it was great for my dry skin, but never felt oily or heavy. it looked great under makeup and wore beautifully as a night cream. my skin looked hydrated and the product never broke me out. i would love to continue to use this cream. for me, two-and-one-half pumps was perfect and i saw an improvement in my skin after testing this out for a few weeks. packaging is luxurious and beautiful too.",positive
"i recd this as part of the birthday gift. it is a very good product. however, i have dry skin and this cream is not hydrating enough for me.",neutral
i really wanted to love this product because of all the hype but after purchasing this item and receiving it as a gift...i can say that it does not do anything for me...i love the idea and packaging but other then being aesthetically pleasing it does not really do that much for my skin.,negative
this product is extremely good. it is moisturizing and helped minimize the appearance of my pores. i feel like my skin is cleaner than ever! i apply to damp clean skin and leave on overnight! i am hydrated the next day like literally glowing,positive
applies fine but i did not really notice any changes. i am also not sure but i think it made my face break out a little.,neutral
i was really wanting to love this but unfortunately it broke me out. i would suggest the drunk elephant or tatcha c serums.,neutral
hurt my skin and impossible to wash off. better off using a chemical exfoliater.,negative
i got this on point bonus using my points the first time i used it i feel like i broke out from it. i mean i guess it could be a coincidence and i happened to break out anyway but i did not use anything else so i am almost sure this was the reason i may try again just to be sure but that is my experience after one use,negative
"nope. not a winner. after one week of ampm application, little white heads started to happen around my chin area. and did not feel hydrated enough. also used with glow recipe sleep mask.",negative
"i have not used it enough to say the benefits, but oh my god it is so small! i refuse to believe its actually ounces!",neutral
i got two samples and used one at night and the second in the morning. i noticed a major difference in my sleep creases on my nose and my deep frown crease is just a fine little line. seriously amazed at how well this works. no major difference in my already fine lines.... but i only used it twice. will definitely purchase the full size,positive
"i received this product for free to test and i found it to be just ok. it claims to balance the skins micro biome which i cannot confirm but it feels ok on the face. i have fairly sensitive and breakout prone skin and i had no irritation or acne from this product. it honestly just felt like a mist of water. if this product really interests you and is in your budget, go for it. if it is not, i would say skip it.",neutral
"i tried this for my oily, acneic skin and found the physical exfoliation harsh and ineffective.",negative
i decided to try this product since it was sent to me complimentary by influenster along with other items and it was a flop. i used it during a week where i was breaking a lot without any makeup and nothing happened! i tried reapplying later on in the day and still nothing. i also placed it on a pimple i had popped but all it did was sting. i stopped using it and tried another week with the same results. murad has great skin care products but this is not one.,negative
"i have been wanting to try this awhile, and i am happy i finally did. i notice that my skin is more tight and soft. easily my new favorite mask.",positive
"i have used this for years. tried out other eye creams but always comes back to this one. trust worthy, very hydrating eye cream. did not feel any other function other than hydration as claimed though.",positive
i just finished a sample of this and at first i really loved it. it is an emollient creamy formula that sank in quickly and left my skin moisturized in the morning. not life altering plumped or glowing but definitely smooth and hydrated. the instructions on the sample packaging said that it was ok to use under and over the eye area. initially i thought that was great. this is an expensive price tag for a small amount of product so eliminating the need for a separate eye cream would justify the cost. unfortunately the essential oils in this like mint and orange oil are not all that friendly to sensitive areas like the under eye at all. at first it was all good but after the second application my under eye area felt slightly tight and uncomfortable. by the third try they were tight and started to sting. too bad because those are completely unnecessary ingredients that may make it feel like the cream is actively doing something but in reality ruin an otherwise lovely face cream.,neutral
"i was given this product to try and have to leave a review today which is not much time! i gave it a however would like to keep using it so i have more time. i have large pores that i hate, and using it under makeup is like using a good primer, my pores are much smaller. i do not find it particularly hydrating though but it does say for oily or combo skin, and mine is quite dry so maybe oily people might have better success with this one. i also only buy vegan products and this company will not state that the product is vegan i looked up the ingredients though and there are a couple things that could either be made made plants or animals so maybe they use an animal based one. it is however, cruelty free, so that is a plus. i will start by giving this product a and may update later!",neutral
"good results after a little over a month of daily use. my face is less oily and red and i see my pores are less visible. not a drastic change, but a notable one. i prefer the texture over tos serum. it soaks in and is not sticky.",positive
this product did no good to my skin. not worth the price for me. it made my skin worked. it is not for combo skin.,neutral
"if you have oily combo acne prone skin i would try the oil free version of this first. every time i use this product i break out in small clogged pore like pimples and some cystic acne on my cheeks. i can tell that it does smooth and lighten my older scars and skin, but there is no point if i am continually breaking out. so for that reason i give it stars because it does do what it claims, but it will break you out the next morning if you are the wrong skin type.",neutral
"works well enough as a moisturizer, but it smells like off-brand lip smackers and the scent lingers.",neutral
it is a very nice sunscreen because it leaves a smooth look and it is clear which i am an esthetician and have always worn sunscreen and this is the first time i see one that is not white and does not leave a white cast but unfortunately it does have dimethicone and silica which clogs my pores and breaks me out in tiny pimples all over my face,neutral
i am really enjoying this product so far. it is been about weeks i can see a difference in the lines on my forehead. it feels nice on the skin layers very well.,neutral
this product was gifted by moon juice. this product delivers on the claims to plump skin and does make my skin feel great. i cannot get over the scent though which is why i am giving this stars. it is effective but the overpowering scent is enough to make me discontinue use. some people have described this as earthy so i do not know if perhaps the one i got was defective in some way because mine smells like old perfume. the smell is so intensely chemically that at first i thought the food i was cooking at the time had gone bad before i realized it was the face serum i had just put on a couple minutes beforehand. if you can get over the putrid smell then it will definitely make your skin look great.,neutral
"the mini size is great for trying it out before committing to larger and more expensive once. it is also great for travel as it is small enough to put in a travel bag. it has a nice fragrance that does not linger and does not leave any tint or sparkle. a small bit goes a long way, so no need to put it on like night mask cream. i wanted to try it to see what the hype was about but i do not see my self buying the larger one. i love how soft it made skin feel and the small size was just right for me.",positive
"amazing product my skin feels smooth and glowing after a couple of use, i have been surprised to see my skin brighter and more even tone!! a must have for my skincare routine",positive
"i have been using this essence for a couple of years and feel it has transformed my skin from sensitive, super dry and patchy. it adds a layer of moisture that works well with serums and moisturizers. it is pricey but for me, it is been a good investment, especially when timed with savings time frames.",positive
"i have been using it for a month and my acne has not changed, i will stick with la roche posay c",neutral
have not seen a difference but still going to try to finish the bottle. my face is soft after i wake up but i still see textured skin,neutral
"when they recommend using this at night and only once a day, i would stick to the directions. the first night i used it, i could feel my acne sting a little bit the stinging stops after seconds and i was scared that i would have a burn on my face but when i woke up in the morning, my skin felt so soft and my acne started clearing up instantly. this is an amazing toner but i would suggest using it once a day and only at night because it can make your skin more sensitive to sunburns they warn you on the bottle and recommend sunscreen. i think it is a fantastic product especially for the price.",positive
the alcohol smell and feel was too much. after using it twice i had to stop. then i see it is water and alcohol as the top ingredients. i was shocked. shocked that in my favourite brand still has not change the basic formula ingredients. although a complimentary product for review i am very disappointed.,negative
"love the size of this product and the packaging. those two things, plus the other good reviews, are what ultimately had me purchase. i really really do not like the consistency though. feels a little bit sticky upon application and seems to leave a bit of a film after application, too. feels sort of cheap... it definitely gives you a glow but overall i am not seeing major improvements. i felt similarly eh about their avocado eye cream. good, but not great.",neutral
left my skin smooth and soft. not a harsh exfoliant. nice fresh scent that is not to overpowering. definitely recommend,positive
"i really wanted to love this product after many recomendations, sadly it just broke me out, i would have put up with the nair type smell, but it just did not work for me.",negative
"i live in a very dry climate and this just was not moisturizing enough for me. i think if i lived someplace humid it would be great. at first i loved the packaging, i am not a fan of putting my hands into a jar of product, but you have to continually clean the little platform to keep gunk and bacteria away. i do not think it is a bad moisturizer, it just is not the one for me.",neutral
"the first care formula delivers the perfect combination of ingredients for optimized anti-aging and hydrating benefits, while boosting the absorption of your treatment products.first care activating serum was very easy to incorporate into my routine. it is my first step post cleanse because it boost absorption of my treatment products. essence, serums, eye-cream, moisturizer the serum has a lightweight texture and is easily absorbed. i did notice a delicate ginger scent. it paired nicely with my other skincare and left my skin smoother, firmer and with a healthy glow. if you are searching for firm radiant skin then look no further sulwhasoo serum is the answer.key ingredients include the following.jamu activatortm complex blend of herbs lotus- anti-aging, improves elasticity, improves fine lines wrinkles rehmannia-antimicrobial properties, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory peony- antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, brightenssolomans seal- heals brighten,nourish white lily- balance cell renewal, purifies, detoxifies, soothes, moisturizers sulwhasoogiftedme firstcare seoultosephora",positive
"i wanted to love this! i have religiously used this twice a day until the bottle was gone, absolutely nothing! definitely a waste of money!",negative
"i really like the fact that this mask does not need to be rinsed out and can be just left overnight. but it did not do much for my skin at all, it is more like a regular moisturizer. i do not think i would have paid the price for this product.",neutral
"i have combination but mostly dry skin, i got this to use both by itself and with a moisturizer cocktailed in on super dry days, and truly did not notice much of a difference. sometimes i had to apply this- times daily onto my skin just to keep it a little bit hydrated. when cocktailed in with a moisturizer it performs better than by itself. it feels very slick, but almost watery at the same time. it did not really absorb all that well on its own, but it absorbed well when used with a moisturizer. overall, i do not think this is worth buying because it truly did not make that much of a difference and i used it multiple times daily, and still my skin was too dry.",negative
honestly not sure how this works but i used a few times and realized i bought the wrong one. the smell is incredibly strong and gives me migraines so if you are sensitive to smells please do not buy,negative
so this product did not do much for me and it is not something i would necessarily run out to get. it did not help eliminate the fine lines underneath my eyes at all and i was hoping maybe it would reduce the visibility slightly but it did not. also tried rubbing it all over as a serum and i do not feel that it did much at all for my face to the point where i would run out to buy it. i was hoping for something awesome due to the fact that i love tacha products but this one in particular is not for me.,neutral
"just finished my first bottle. it was a great formula made my skin feel soft but you have to use this within the month shelf life....i assume...because i have had mine for months it was to the end of the bottle, so i am not mad...but i went to take a shower this morning the bottle had a thick creamy foul smelling substance coming from the bottle. i have to guess because it is made with greek yogurt, it is prone to do this. i will most likely repurchase if they have a smaller size. i do not think i can use a whole bottle in the month shelf life duration. but i still loved the formula.",neutral
i was excited to try this super awesome brand but i was not thrilled. the niacinamide burned my skin a little bit and did not create a softer texture. when i first applied it it made my skin turn a little bit red so maybe this just is not product that agrees with my skin. i was given this complimentary from paulas choice.,neutral
"i have combo skin that is more dry in the winter. i tried this as an am moisturizer and will never again. i wore no makeup all day and every time i touched my face i felt like an oil slick because the product never fully absorbed and made me so greasy. by the time i washed my face again that night i had three giant pimples on my chin and jawline. might be ok for you if you do not have acne prone skin, but beware. bummed this did not work because of all the hype around it and the price is right.",negative
"i am a year old female with combo-dry skin, suffering with uneven skin tone and uneven texture. i have tried every mask and product under the sun. i watch youtube videos back to back trying to find a solution i do tons of research, but like most people when i do not see an instant solution i get unhappy. i never really considered spending on a product but i kept hearing glowing reviews on the babyfacial so i went to sephora and got a sample. i washed my face as usual been doing the korean step system and then put the mask on for minutes. when i rinsed it off, literal shock. i saw instant results i swear to you. my skin was so so so soft, like dry skin who? uneven texture was so improved, i could not believe it. so i purchased it the next day. every time i use this and put my makeup on, i have the best skin day. it has really improved my uneven skin tone as well. i am now using the night serum which is a daily version of this mask, and the marula oil which is to be used after these products and is heavenly. i would never ever stray from drunk elephant now i am sold.",positive
"this thick waxy gel pills like crazy. i honestly do not understand why this has so many good reviews, maybe i just got a bad one? luckily it was just a mini sized one that i got in a sephora favorites bundle so i threw it out. i never expected a product like this from a brand like murad.",negative
"i personally love it. as someone with sensitive skin and acne scars, it has significantly reduced the redness in my face! it does not sting my face like other comments have mentioned. however, i only use it in the mornings. vitamin c can be harsh on the body in the first place. if you do really rub it in, it turns almost into an exfoliate which is not good to do everyday. i just lightly tap it in and it has worked for me. also, cannot beat the price for it",positive
"this product reminds me a lot of herbivores aquarius pore purifying bha cream. both do not have any fragrance, have a matter finish, and absorb quickly. i am giving this one four star only because i expected it to be a bit richer, considering that it is a mask. otherwise, i would agree with previous reviews that say it can be used as a moisturizer. would recommend this product.",positive
"great cleanser for combooily skin. i felt like my skin got brighter since i started using it about two weeks ago. it cleans my skin of excess oils without drying. as mentioned by other reviews, the formula probably had essential oils in it so beware if you have sensitive skin. i used to wash my face for maybe less than secs, which to really have the benefit you should wash for longer, but it smells so good that i want to wash my face for longer!",positive
"this is not one of those masks that you can just leave on for however long you feel like, you will get post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation. start with the minimum time to see how your skin reacts. i do not see a lot of brightening with this mask.",neutral
feels sticky and does not moisturize also the stick is too big so you cannot reach it in small areas like abound the noes and eyes and you cannot rub around,negative
if you have hyperpigmentation just give this a try! i have noticed a significant difference in the redness on my face since i have started using this product over a month ago. i honestly am just shocked and plan to stock up so i always have some at the ready. for you really cannot go wrong.,positive
this moisturizer is a big to do so i bought it. i do not find this more exceptional than other more affordable moisturizers. i use this for with dry patches until i used it up. i will not purchase again. good moisturizer but not for me.,neutral
it is a good funny product. my husband and i joke around anytime we get these but they are too expensive. they do work and they firm and moisturize my skin. also they do have quite a lot of product that you can use on the rest of the face and hands. so really you get quite a bit of product we just find the mask part funny.,neutral
i feel like this product does remove most all of my makeup but you have to follow it up with a good cleanser because it the product is so oily. it leaves an extremely oily residue on your face. there are definitely other oily products out there that do not leave your face with that residue.,neutral
"these eye masks look great and are fun to put on, and you do feel a tightening sensation while they are on. the product also feels nice and light when you rub the excess into your skin however, it did nothing for my puffiness. i have hereditary eyebags which is fine, but the extra puffiness went nowhere. the search continues.",neutral
"i was impressed when i first got this. i have combo skin and can get greasy at times. this kept it as bay for a week when first started using. now i cannot tell a difference. my pores are the same size, still oily and still have break outs. worst side effect, which i believe may be due to this face wash is my eyes are always red now. my eyes are no longer clear and really dry but this all happended when first started using this product. so it seems very irritating to eyes, or at least for me.",negative
"i have mixed emotions about this product. it is so luxurious and makes your face feel amazing. the texture is wonderful. but one week after i started using, i noticed considerably sized white pigmented splotches on my face. i had not changed anything else about my skincare routine except for adding in this product. once i stopped using it, the splotches cleared up. it is very strange. they were subtle spots and did not itch or anything, but definitely were noticeable under make up. i am very sad because i adore the actual product, it just did not adore me in return.",neutral
"this is a really nice eye cream. it makes my eyes feel refreshed, more plump and it is very gentle on the skin. i am a big fan of squalane in skincare as it is perfect for any skin type.there are other eye creams that are just as good though.",neutral
"squalane is an oil you all, this is meant to be a first cleanse and to be followed up with another cleanser. my super sensitive eyes do not have any problem with it and it takes my makeup off beautifully. i wish the larger size was more accessible because this is my favorite cleanser of all time, gentle yet effective and a pleasure to use. melts from a cream to an oil when warmed up on your skin.",positive
"i love how moisturizing this is and i do think it is faded my freckles. but dear god it gave me the worst acne on my chin. i have never had acne, not even as a teen. so to suddenly have my chin erupt is horrible. even taking a break and then trying to use it only a few times a week results in the same issue. i am hoping i can use it on the rest of my face and avoid my chin and things will be ok. the smell is odd- not unpleasant it smells like a medicinal herbal tea.",neutral
"very pricey but i love this stuff. it stays on after multiple washes and looks very natural. the scent is good, but you can notice the dreaded self-tanner smell linger after some hours.",positive
"this cream is very lightweight and i could see it being great for someone with oily skin. i have really dry skin, and this did not do enough to moisturize it. the fragrance in here was also a bit overpowering for me, but if you are not sensitive to fragrance you might enjoy this! overall, i think there are better and less expensive alternatives.",neutral
"this felt on my face how it dried on the bottle crusty weird! it also pilled like crazy. i tested it with other products on it is own. it made no difference. i do not care that it is affordable, it is a completely unappealing formula. i gave it two stars because my acne seemed decently under control when using it alongside my normal routine, but the current formulation is not worth it. i tried it for about two months before giving up.",negative
"i bought this lotion and serum that went with it. let me start by saying it smells amazing. i finished it fairly quickly even though i only used it before bed. i found myself hoping to wake up with glowing and bright skin and ran out of the product before seeing any effect really. my skin is not any softer, clearer, or more even than it was before.",neutral
after applications i am not blown away by this... yes it give a glow in a short period of time. color is nice but a bit orange for me... one thing really annoying... it sticks on jewelry and watch bands or goes away in the humid parts of your body like arm crease! it has also a weird smell... i will not buy this again,neutral
"i really wanted to love this, but it pills so bad to the point i had to wash it off immediately. i have never had such a bad experience!! sorry! i love glow recipe, but this... i hate it!",negative
"worst product from the inkey list and worst cleansing balm i have ever tried! it has a weird consistency that not only separates in the tube but also feels waxy on the face. the waxy texture also makes it hard to wash off with pretty much any cleanser i have tried. last but certainly not least, it does not even remove any of your makeup. never though i would say this, but i actually think makeup removing wipes would be more effective than this cleansing balm.",negative
"i am not one to really leave reviews. however, i did receive my package just yesterday that contained the entire line up. minus the avocado products. i have very oily skin, that is sensitive, with the occasional pimple. i was very worried using so many products all at once thinking it would leave my skin oily and greasy. however, i was wrong. when i woke up this morning my skin was bright, pores were already reduced to a certain degree, not excessively oily, and very bright. also, my redness has already reduced. i will definitely be buying a lot of these products again. especially the toner. perfect product for oily skin!",positive
"i have had this for well over a year now, and i cannot make it work for me. no matter what moisturizer i use i recommend a light one and how much time i give it to absorb, this will pill on my face all over. as i have tanned, the tint becomes even more apparent and leaves a sort of shiny, metallic coating on my skin that looks unnatural instead of dewy. may be a better option for medium to fairer folks.",negative
i wanted to love this because it is so light and smooth. it gets absorbed almost instantly. but it leaves my skin looking oily after a couple hours,neutral
"it works well, my skins overall texture has improved and it looks smoother. the smell is really overpowering especially in the morning. i smell like charcoal grilled hot dogs.got a sample from sephora and will not be buying the full size until they fix the smell.",neutral
"my skin looks glowy the next day. but. this is unscented, yet smells off-putting enough to where i would not repurchase. when first applied it smells like an ordinary lotion but quickly smells like a stale old lotion that is been sitting in your cabinet for decades. when you turn head you smell a more intense whiff of it. get a sample first. many people can endure smells for the sake of using unscented products only, however, i am not that kind of person.",neutral

two stars because it gets the job done....might not do it well but it gets your makeup off. this balm will break down my foundation but have a difficult time removing my eye makeup. the packaging is horrible. it is not easy to squeeze out. there are way better balms out there worth the money that do a better job at removing makeup.,negative
"i ordered ths in anticipation of the old, dry winters we have and really did not like it or recommend it. i used the whole pot hoping i would change my mind but i did not. i used this cream and night and also only used to use facial oils no face creams and found this cream way too greasy. it did not soak into my skin and i guess provided a true barrier except that barrier would rub off on my pillow and i would wake up with dry patches all over my face. i ended up buying the drunk elephant protini cream and like it so much more if anyone wants a comparison",negative
great product! works well! did not irritate my skin at all. left my skin feeling smooth and healthy!,positive
a little definitely goes a long way and i did feel that this cream made a difference in under eye circles. i am constantly on the go and tend to have dark circles always and this product truly lightened them up. i am not a fan of this scent of this line which is a bummer because i do think the products work but i cannot stand the scent.,neutral

"i waited a couple months to review this, just to make sure that my bad first impression of the product was not just a fluke. but waiting only proved my first impression to be correct. here is why. the product smells like when you have a really bad bloody nose, like raw iron. weird, i know, but i have had a lot of bloody noses, so i know the scent pretty well. i am very sensitive to smells and the smell of blood is super repulsive to me. the product does not soak in, so the strong scent lingers until you completely wash off the product.. the product does not soak in. it just sits on your skin like a mask. it gets on my bedding even if i put it on earlier in the day, making all my blankets and pillows smell disgusting. i worry about it bleaching or staining my bedding because of the high vitamin c content.. the product is a cream but it is got a super dry texture so it does not spread well at all. i have to use a super small amount or it makes my skin sting and itch really bad. i dilute it with a toner but it still stings a little. i have never had a reaction like that to any other product.in the end, it does have a positive effect on my complexion overall brightening. but for me it is just not worth the horrible smell and feeling like my face is on fire. i will use up what i bought, but i will not be buying this again. i hope my review helps others.",negative
i have been using for almost weeks and i see no improvement. very disappointed in the product.,negative
"i have been using the rest of the tatcha skincare line and really wanted to love this. my skin was looking pretty good, some black heads, but no actual break outs. put the mask out, took it off, and instant breakouts on both cheeks. definitely get a sample of this first. cleansing oil, polish, essence, and water cream are totally worth the money. this was a let down.",negative
great packaging. nice thick cream. but for some reason it made my skin feel so uncomfortable that i had to wash it off. i wish i could like it but it is going back,neutral
"general pros conspros airy and lightweight consistency, sturdy glass jar container, adequate hydrating for oily skin types might not be enough for dry skin cons sometimes difficult to get last bit of product due to jar shape, very pricey for the amount you get, very strong artificial fragrance despite it being a clean sephora product from personal experience, i found this moisturizers scent to be very very strong- way too strong for a clean product. i was honestly surprised by how much it smelt like a jolly rancher. it also made me breakout in places where i never struggled with acne before. the smell lingered throughout the day as well. obviously everyone is skin will react differently, but i would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin types people who are looking for low scented products.",negative
"this cream is a new staple in my routine, it is a thick consistency but a little goes a long way. i also like to rub it on my neck and chest for the collage purposes. i have combo oily skin and this does not leave me feeling greasy. i bought this in the trendmood box steal for first aid and i could not be happier!",positive
i have sensitive skin and this is the best summer moisturizer for me,positive

"so i have pretty dry under eyes, but if i use a thicker eye cream i get those annoying bumps under my eyes that take forever to go away. in comes this beauty with its light but hydrating and moisturizing properties. i mainly use it to hydrate and moisturize because once again, dry under eyes. i have tried to fix this using thick and heavy eye creams before but they always seem to just sit on top and give me bumps but i also could not use those light weight eye creams because it still felt dry under my eyes. as i was browsing for a new eye cream a sephora employee tried this one me and i fell in love with the texture and how hydrated my under eyes felt without that heavy film on my eyes. keep in mind i was still hesitant as this was a light formula and i was expecting dryness in a couple of hours. so i left the store without buying it to see how long my hydration lasts. since i was shopping around downtown it was no problem spending a couple hours just shopping and eating. towards the end of the day at a solid hours my eye area was still surprisingly hydrated! that was when i went to sephora to purchase it. several months into using this i no longer have dry under eyes and no bumps thank goodness. i also notice the fine lines around my eyes are more plump and my concealer looks much smoother under my eyes as well. i only took off one star because the pump secretes too much product in one go and i much prefer squeezy tubes.",positive
"i am not one to leave reviews normally, but this cream is so glorious it deserves to be spoken about! i have been dealing with smile lines around my mouth that have gotten fairly prominent as i smile constantly in my customer service world which is also set in the great outdoors- my skin takes a beating! i was looking for something to help erase these crevasses as i am just too young for them yet! i do have acne prone skin and noticed that, if worn too often andor not blended into skin well enough, this collagen cream did give small breakouts. however, i found that the best for me was to apply this two or three nights in a row about once or twice a week or so and, voila! my skin is youthful and supple upon waking! this has been the very best product i have used for filling in those deepening lines and stopping them from getting any worse. just be sure to not use it every night and, seriously, a little goes a veeery long way! this has a slick consistency when applied that just melts and slides over skin- it is not only plumping but hydrating too! rub it in thoroughly! this tub will last me probably two years, there is so much product for needing so little! this will remain a staple in my skin care routine.",positive
"i really wanted to take my time when i got this product. the product comes in a really beautiful round glass container. as a lady with mature skin i was a little reticent about trying this product. i do have some dark circles and puffiness under my eyes but have little expectations and try to cover that area as much as possible. i also said to myself, this is a cream that goes on the most sensitive and thinnest part of the eye. i worried about irritation but i was pleasantly surprised. the product smells heavenly. the product itself is a very smooth cream. i applied it under my eyes and felt the coolness instantly. it absorbed quite nicely and did not feel at all greasy, nor did it feel gummy. i wanted to give it a real try. i noticed that the first couple of days the only difference was that the skin felt a bit more supple but did not notice lessening of puffiness and my circles were not any different. after the first week, i started to notice that the skin seemed not as dark as before and that the skin seemed to be smoother and not as puffy as before. by week two there was a more pronounced difference. i found the difference to be remarkable and it was noticed by my husband who was really surprised that it could work. he said that he would like to give it a go because the circles and puffiness are some of the reasons he wears his glasses all the time. he is starting to try it himself. who said that eye creams are only for the ladies? i will try to followup as he keeps trying the product. i am giving this product a out of stars because it does work. it feels light and cool going on and it does what it says. it soothes, it smooths, it makes the darker circles a little lighter and easier to look at and is does a great job of getting my puffies to go away. i have tried other creams and this one really helped. i had not heard of this product before but will definitely be buying for myself and maybe... can not wait to see how the hubby does! maybe treat him too...",positive
"excellent product for covering my redness. i got so excited, i did not even finish buffing it in before i took these pics. i used only one drop of product on half of my face.",positive
"i am currently wearing this product as i am typing this. i have used it about four times since purchasing it. i purchased because of all the great reviews. i have combination skin with some large pores and some uneven texture so i was hoping this product would work for me. the container is smaller than i expect it to be but it did come full to the brim which was nice. it has a faint orange citrus smell and feels really velvety on the skin it does not leave any oily residue which is nice for a overnight mask. if i am being honest the first time i used it i looked in the mirror the next day halfway through the day with makeup on and i felt as though my pores looked smaller but the other times i have used this mask and i did not notice much of a difference the next day no dewiness, my pores are still visible, not much evening of my skin or much hydration. i also enjoy that it comes with the little scraper so you are not dipping dirty fingers into the product so i appreciated that. i will continue to use but after reading reviews and seeing other people mention getting instant overnight results i was somewhat expecting the same. maybe i need to just continue using to see results i am following the directions on the back so i do not think i am using this wrong or anything.",neutral
"this product is gentle, as described, however, i did notice that it leaves behind a difficult to ignore stickiness. i honestly could not get past that yucky film feeling enough to use it for longer than a week, so i cannot speak to its efficacy.",neutral
"i did not really see a change my skinhair after using these. i do think that i have used better hairskin gummies. the ingredients in this, however, are pretty good ingredients that usually work for me. it could probably be that i bought a small bottle? i did not give it enough time to work? they did taste good though.",neutral
"definitely one of the thickest day creams i have ever tried. sure, my face is moisturized, but for this price point i would expect something more, a soothing property to reduce redness, or a mattifyingilluminating quality. personally i prefer lightweight day creams that sink in quickly and do not take a lot of rubbing in. this one is certainly for somebody, just not me.",neutral
"i was really wanting to love this product given all the rave reviews and various skincare youtubers saying how great it is for sensitive skin. unfortunately this broke me out- and while my skin is sensitive, i very rarely break out. however, my product also smelled old, so i wondered if maybe i got a bad batch and maybe that is why my skin did not like it. i did like the feel of the product however, and i think for the price it is worth giving a try. just did not work for my skin.",negative
i am very surprised by how many positive reviews these have. they did absolutely nothing to help my zits go away. i have tried them times. never helped once. they are expensive and a waste of money. also they leave an indentation on my face where i wore it overnight so i wake up with a zit still and an indented circle impressed around the zit that does not go away until i am up and about and rehydrated from the night. kind of makes it worse?,negative
influencers really lied about this one. hydrating sits on top of skin until it is rubbed off while sleeping and moves around on you. this does not hydrate into the skin-so i can see why you look shiny. faint smell not sure what it is.,negative
the ingredients are really impressive. i love that there is not a ton of preservatives in this formula and instead they load up on the good stuff! i have not noticed a major difference in my skin yet however that usually takes time. and my skin was in pretty good condition to begin with. i really enjoy this and it is a great ph balancer before a vitamin c serum.,neutral

made my eyes look older! this is not even remotely hydrating and while it has enough retinol to cause my eyelids to peel off getting my brows waxed... it does not seem to have enough to make a difference. underneath my eyes is so creepy and dry i look years older than when i started using this. maybe works in combo with a hydrating cream but who wants to have to use two eye creams.,negative

"the texture is very weird in a sense that it is not creamy, also not like liquid, nor like gel. it feels more like oil to be honest, but not completely. and due to this strange texture, you do not feel like applying the product even though you might have applied a lot. so i really do not know what the point is making a texture feeling like this except consuming this thing fast without realizing it. i prefer the regenerating serum much better since it is truly a serum, but i am not sure what this is.",negative
"i have a lot of fancier moisturizers with prettier packaging, but i keep coming back to this because it works so beautifully for my aging combination skin that is prone to redness and sensitivity. i feel that my dry oily skin areas are much more balanced when i am using this product and it keeps my skin calm and well hydrated. cannot really ask for more than that.",positive
"i saw results fast with this and i absolutely love it. now i am confidently wearing no makeup. i think it helped my brightness and it definitely feels great on the skin. i was a longtime user of the caudalie brightening serum, which i still love, but this brought my skin to life again. i think caudalie is still a wonderful option, but maybe my skin got used to it. tatcha never fails, and this has to be one of their best products! also, this product does not need a ton to get working.",positive
"i do not hate it but i do not love it. it is hard for me to get over the oily feeling when applying it. it does not feel hydrating when i apply it, it just feels like a layer of oil on my skin. however my skin does feel a little more plump the next day after wearing it overnight, but nothing out of this world. the biggest turn off is the fragrance. i bought it knowing there is fragrance but i wanted to see if it would be a game changer for me. overall i do not think it is anything life-changing personally and i do not think i will buy again.",neutral

"i love the texture of this. it does not make add to my oily tone, but it adds the right amount of moisture to my cheeks. the only thing i have bad to say is the bumps that i developed over time on my forehead. they do not have anything in them,but they are harditchy like and i found out that it was not a typical acne, but a type of fungal acne that a typical acne treatment will not treat. not sure what ingredient that causes this, but when i quit using this they went away and then i purchased again not long ago and they came back. i used this for months so i had plenty of time to experiment and see. i so wish that was not an issue because otherwise it is so perfect for me. mad because i have not found anything like it that does not add to my oily ness, but also perfect for dry areas.",neutral
"i was new to the retinol game and i am honestly shocked there is not more disclaimers on how to use this product. do your homework. read about retinols- gradual increase means trying it once a week for maybe a month, then twice a week for a month, three times a week and so forth. even before you buy this i would recommend buying something with less retinol and build your skin tolerance. you also must buy something to help balance the skinprevent damage something with vitamin b so you could buy the moisturizer they recommend. even with the minimal use i had with this product it left my skin looking burned- that was using it with a moisturizer and gradual increase of use. i just wish i had tried something with less retinol first. i hope this review saves someone from making the same mistake that i did. maybe even talk to your dermatologist before adding retinol into your routine",negative

"i am a lover of yttp, this is true. but this product is amazing! i have full skin. i always have. but this product is insane! i have been using it x a week along with the superberry glow and adaptogen moisturizer that i use daily and let me just say...wow. it is definitely exfoliating, but not harsh on my somewhat sensitive skin. that being said, my skin is cherry red for about minutes after i get out of the shower! it calms down and i am left with the most glowy, soft skin of my life! cannot recommend enough!",positive
good product but really does not do much. it adds a cost under the eye that makes it appear brighter but does not really do anything overtime.,negative
"i have had nothing but great experience with other sunday riley products- unfortunately this irritated and dried my eyes out quite a bit- i do have extremely sensitive skin so it seems to work well for others. i also was not aware that this is not considered a eye cream- meaning it should only be applied to your under eye area.. i struggle with dryness on my under and upper eye areas, so this is a no for me",negative
"just finished my jar of this moisturizer. i wanted to be obsessed with it but personally it was just okay for me. not bad, not amazing. i found that it was not deeply hydrating. i have what i would consider normal or combination skin and live in southern california with dry but mild winters, so do not know how it would work for those with dry skin or in a much harsher winter climate. i enjoyed the scent and consistency and while it did a decent job, i was not wowed with any extraordinary results and did not experience the hydration i expected so for the price, likely would not repurchase.",neutral
"this is such a great acne treatment! i am not fond of the smell, but it honestly works great! i usually put on before my makeup in the am and after all my skincare products in the pm and my acne is almost clear within a few days. love it!",positive
i really had high hopes for this one because i loved their outsmart acne treatment it was a game changer. but this one only irritated my skin and caused me to break out more. its way too expensive and honestly i am sad to say not worth it.,neutral
"i gave this stars because it is not a bad product but did not work for my skin type for whatever reason. after using it my skin felt very clean and nice, i enjoyed the smell but it made me break out. not like an allergic reaction but in random pimples and i know sometimes your skin goes through a purge but i used the product for weeks and my skin never cleared up. i have dry to normal skin and a product that works well for me is the cerave hydrating facial cleanser. i wanted to like this but it just did not work sadly.",neutral
definitely moisturized my skin but it did because me to spike in hard breakouts that have left scarring. i received it as a try out from a beauty group and i am not keen for further purchase.,neutral
"the serum is lovely--light and smooth. the package is disappointing. the bottle is for oz, yet is at least times the size, and you cannot see how much product is in there. rethink the bottle, olehenrikson.",positive
horribly oily. separates so badly- comes out part mouse mostly oil. once on the skin it really emphasizes texture. and glitter specs in it- very very sparkly. honestly not a good product at all.,negative
"packaging is cute and i was excited about a mess free application, however it is not smoothsoft enough to glide. it tugs at the skin and that is a major no no when dealing with the sensitive eye area and trying to prevent signs of aging. perhaps when the weather is warmer it will glide better but for now, even if the formula is good, the tugging probably hurts me more than any retinol could help.",neutral
"it works yet i believe i received a bad batch. unfortunately, the one that i receive does not smell too great. this is actually my rd purchase of the product, yet it is the first time receiving one that does not smell good at all.",negative
"after a weeks use i noticed i lot of drying especially around the mouth area, the brand is awesome but this one did not work for me however i do hope it works for you...",negative
"a little goes a long way with this face wash! it mixes with water and makes a lovely creamy face wash. it makes my skin feels so clean and removes all my makeup. it smells really good too, slightly minty. i would recommend this face wash to anyone! i got this for free to review!",positive
decent product but i have not noticed any results... i think you can get the same results with a much more affordable cleanser. the exfoliant is nice but nothing else is worth the price for me,neutral
"i like ordinary in general but this product did not make any difference of using once a week. i do not want my skin to feel dry, so avoiding over use. you thought to return but will be waste of product and promote consumerism, so just keeping because of salicylic ingredient.",neutral
hydrates skin nicely! but causes my spf to pill and that is a no go in my books!,negative
this moisturizer is perfect for my skin. the weight of it works for me all year round.,positive
too astringent. newer generation of this type of product is hydrating. gals with oily skin may love this.,neutral
it is too pricey for salicylic acid that you can buy at the drugstore for less. but it does work! i did not care for the packaging because it was a little difficult to squeeze out at times.,neutral
"something about this did not agree with my skin. i have since used a glycolic acid toner with no issues, as well as a sample of good genes. so it is not the lactic acid giving me the problem it is the orange oil i think, which i have had issues with in other formulations. when creating an aha toner or serum, the aha should be the only irritating ingredient. adding other irritating ingredients is just asking for issues, like the red face i had to calm down with other calming products.",negative
"this moisturizer is great for my dry sensitive skin, but i will say it is heavily fragranced in my opinion. it did not irritate my skin but the scent was a bit overwhelming the first time i used it. so that is the reason why it is not stars. i wish they made a fragrance free version.",positive
love this product!!! feels fresh and clean! takes out all the impurities from your skin.,positive
i have been using it for over month. this products really effective. it helps to brighten my skin and even it. all my pimples scars due to hormones are just gone. i love it!,positive
i love how it lathers and makes my face feel smooth. first time i used it a lot of product came out and lost a handful. not liking the packaging,positive
smells so nice and so soft but super streaky will be taking it back,negative
"received a sample, at first it smelled like oranges and was not too sticky but before i could finish the bottle i feel like it went bad because it started to smell kind of rancid. the older it gets the sticker it gets too. i had to wash it off and toss it.",negative
i love this face oil. i have sensitive eyes and they react to lots of stuff but this oil does not make my ocular rosacea flare up. aside from that it is a great last step that leaves my skin glowing and does not because me to breakout. i love that it has coq in there for an added anti-aging bonus. it also seemed to last forever i like that you are getting lots of product compared to most oils that are oz.,positive
i would like to start off by saying i have sensitive skin and i am just plain out picky about my skin care products. i got this as a sample. i saw some improvement with one use from that sample. i figured that it might be the sample but i figured i would buy a small bottle and really test it. just purchased the. oz bottle and this will forever be in my daily skin care arsenal. if you are thinking about it just jump on it.,positive
"the lotion itself is divine. the packaging is atrocious the refill instructions are confusing causing you to accidentally lose product. the letters come off the packaging with each use and get all over your face and hands... embarrassing walking around with the letter t on your cheek!! i love the idea of refillable packaging but really this just creates more waste than any other bottle. if you love the product just buy the value size that does not do the gimmicky, greenwashing refills-- at least once they fix the letters coming off issue.",neutral
i was recommended this in the store as i was looking for an eye cream product to help with hydration and lines. this seems more for depuffing instead of hydration. it seemed to make my eye area little dryer and more pronounced wrinkles showing. will return.,negative
"good cleanser with no drying effect. i liked it. it is not anything astounding, it just will do.",neutral
"i had high hopes for this product but the high amount of silicone really made me feel like everything was just sitting on top of my skin. i think it would make for a great makeup primer but it certainly did not hydrate. the silicone sitting on the skin temporarily madeit super smooth but clogged my pores. perhaps for some people, they want this effect as a primer.",neutral
i received this product from influenster to review. it is light weight and has a pleasant citrus scent. it unfortunately leaves quiet a bit of a white cast and is hard to wear underneath makeup. leaves me skin looking patchy.,neutral
i hate acne. i hate that i am still getting acne in my mid thirties. i absolutely hate acne treatments. all they do is dry me out and exaggerate my fine lines and wrinkles. and they make my skin flake. this oil is a godsend. it clears me up but also serves as a beautiful antioxidants and moisturizer. i highly recommend.,positive
i love everything from glow recipe. they use the best quality ingredients and i love the way they package their products. i love the texture of this and its super lightweight and non-greasy. i highly recommend it.,positive
"i love this sunscreen. i have tried many sunscreens before most of which i did not love the feeling on my skin some were too oily, some were too drying. my skin is very fair and my skin is very dry. so with that being said this sunscreen was great for my very fair, very dry skin. it is very moisturizing and leaves a really pretty glow! to me, it had a little bit of a white sheen and washed me out but when i massaged it into the skin that white sheen went away. love this sunscreen!",positive
"this made me breakout, tiny little red bumps all over my face. my skin also stung a little bit directly after applying this. my skin is not even that sensitive so this was surprising. i really wanted this product to work for me",negative
"i received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. this is a scentless serum that once i applied my skin does feel a little tighten after applying it but that lasts only until i apply the cream on top. my skin also feels less dry however i do not notice any glow from the serum. you need about- pumps to apply on face and neck. it does have a smooth silly texture and absorbs after a couple minutes. it is been nice so far however, considering the price i would not recommend. it is nice, it feels nice but so are other serums. i recommend the blockbuster face cream instead.",neutral
"i love the texture of this and how moisturizing it is, but it does not remove makeup as well as many other cleansing balms. i have used up multiple jars of this stuff, but i have since found better options.",neutral
got a sample of this product and soo disappointed. it pilled up on my face. feels so sticky and greasy. feels like i put sunscreen on my face.,negative
"i had a bit more expectations for this product, it is cool having the product come in a powdered texture so you can really get it the consistency you want with water. but, be careful leaving this product in the shower or close to a water source, the powder inside can turn very clumpy from water exposure and it will be hard to shake it out. my pores could have felt cleaner, and i still found myself reaching for different pores extracting methods while using this. i have used better exfoliates.",neutral
"the face mud mask was slightly difficult to remove from the packaging and then apply neatly to face. the face mask was made for a smaller face small eye holesmouth with no facial hair. i found that the mask did not dry within the specified timing. when i left for almost double the time, various sections were still wet. removal was easy. the mud did soften the skin and leave moisturized.",negative
"i like the way this serum works and i feel like my face looks better after using it. unfortunately, it made my sensitive skin break out after several uses and the scent is bothersome to me.i wanted to love it because the results seemed great but ultimately had to stop using it.",neutral
"i received this product as a sample and it is amazing! my oily skin had been very dehydrated for months and i tried two very good different products ant this serum saved my skin. i could not even put make up on because it would bring out the dryness, but after adding this serum to my routine, combined with my face cream, i do not need anything else! it is light, does not leave oilyness and has a beautiful scent.to all those with dehydration issues, i assure you that if you combine this with another moisturizer that suit your needs you will love it. usually serums are not made to be used on their own.",positive
i love how this made my skin feel refreshed when applying but this product sadly did nothing for me. it did nothing bad nor good so maybe it was balancing my skin?,neutral
"i love this product so much. my skin feels so great the morning after i put it on, i use it every other day. i have been using another retinol product but started searching for something different after that product changed packaging and in my opinion became criminally wasteful with the excessive plastic packaging that was completely unnecessary. but perhaps it was a good thing because it led me to find this new product by kiehls! to be completely honest i have only been using it for about a month so to make claims about the effectiveness of the retinol is it really possible because retinol takes about six months to see a difference but since i know my skin responds well to retinol i am a concentration in this formula is similar i am not too concerned that it is not going to work. what i am so impressed about is how well the peptides and the ceramides are working on my skin. i have literally forgotten to put moisturizer on twice after using this product and my skin still feels super moisturized in the morning. i am doubly happy because now i am going to phase out one of my peptide moisturizers now that i have got this!",positive
"i love how gentle this is while still visibly brightening, but why does it absolutely stink? i am extremely tolerant of scent in skincare, but this is just totally stinky and unpleasant. the results are fine but not good enough to outweigh the stench.",neutral
it did make my skin feel great but also unfortunately caused me to break out which has not happened in many years.,negative
"i have combination skin. i am in my early thirties. this serum broke out my skin almost immediately. everyday i would find a new pimple, not a good look. it helped with wrinkles, but increased breakouts. very strange.",negative
"thank god i bought a trial size. i wanted to try clean beauty products, but this one smells like a port-a-potty! i cannot get past the smell to tell you if it helps your skin. as far as a setting spray, it did not set my makeup any better then without.",negative
"i have acne prone skin with lots of dark spots left from scars. this product claims to fix those dark spots, and for this low price, i was like yeah, sure! it has a nice gel like consistency, and leaves no residue, blending in nicely too. but it literalyl does absolutely nothing. i used it diligently praying for a change, but nothing happened. its probably a good moisturizer for people with oily skinbecause its very light and mattifying, but it does not do what its advertised to do. i am a fan of the ordinary, i have their peel and salicylic acid serum, but this just are not it. pretty disappointed, want mymoney back, but cannot get it back cuz its been three months. i expected better do not waste you are money. use aveeno brightening set it will probably workbetter.",negative
i really love this cleansing oil. i have always had dry skin and after the first time my face felt so hydrated and soft. it did not feel oily after washing off either. i have been using this for about days and my face has not felt this good in years. i highly recommend this,positive
this serum helps brightening my dark spots and also heals troubled skins without irritating. absorb quicky and packaging is convenient to use.,positive
broke my face out sooo bad! stopped using after the nd breakout! money down the drain!,negative
this gel cream made my oily skin even more oily and the cream stayed tacky and was uncomfortable on my skin. it was a no for me.,negative
this product was given to me free by skinfix. what an awesome little serum! the seaweed hyaluronate is meant to pull in moisture and give skin a smoother appearance... and my skin sure felt plumper and fuller! would definitely recommend!,positive
really good product. worked for my skin. i work recommend it.,positive
my eyebags and dark circles are so prominent that although i have a full face of makeup and an extra dab of concealer i cannot seem to make them go away. i started using this eye cream for about weeks now. my mom whose been my biggest beauty critic actually noticed the improvement.- brighter eyes and less puffiness she said. she actually asked me grab her a tube of this next time i am at sephora. i am very happy with this product and so is my mom.,positive
awful. it made me breakout very badly and it took me a long time to figure out this was the because. i figured maybe it was just my skin so i gave it away and it made her breakout too.,negative
"i have had skin issues for the last week due to overusing an acne face wash. my face was really read and splotchy. i put this on, probably a little more than recommended, and it looked like i had makeup on! i am so impressed. i got this as a sample in the play! box this month, and i plan on buying when i run out.",positive
"do not buy it!!!!!!!!! hands down, worst moisturizer i have ever used. people are obsessed with it just because of the price. it is impossible to spread on your skin. it is like rubbing stale peanut butter on your face.",negative
"i love using this product morning and evening before using its corresponding moisturizer. the serum absorbs well on my skin, leaving it silky and smooth to the touch. it does not leave my skin feeling greasy and weighed down with product. the light herbalfloral scent is refreshing and pleasant. overall, i feel this product helps to firm my skin and improve the look of the fine lines around my eyes and my smile lines. i am excited to experience the results after further extended use.freeproduct trywithtopbox",positive
using it from last year and bought- packages loving it,positive
i know everyone loves cerve and just like them i ran out to buy it. i have very dry skin and i live in canada so it can be cold. cerve was not for me and it did not work well with my makeup. this is where this came to the rescue. it soothes softens hydrated and moisturize my skin. if you tried the inexpensive stuff and those failed you then this might be your new friend. they now have it in a mini version so test it out! by the way i did a video on this on youtube melly be hope this helps! have a great day,positive
"this exfoliating mask is way too harsh, even if you do not have sensitive skin. the granules are way too large and even when you are super gentle about applying it is still too abrasive. left my skin feeling more textured and damaged. the only positives is the packaging is pretty and it smells nice.",negative
"i am yrs old with medium skin tone, and i have spent my youth telling myself that since i do not burn easily in the sun, i did not need sun protection. well sure enough, i hit my late s and start noticing dark spots on my face i have been using this every day am and pm for the past month and i can definitely see an improvement in my dark spots. the consistency is a bit like a gel. i apply it and wait minutes for it to absorb before putting on makeup and sunscreen and i have not had any issues with piling. as with any skin care products targeting hyperpigmentation, you need to use sunscreen otherwise do not even bother spending money on skincare products!",positive
"pretty decent moisturizer. i have oily, acne prone skin so i use this sparingly. after an at home peel or microdermabrasion or if my skin is feelinglooking a little dry i will use this at night. does not feel heavy or greasy, soaks right in. not a huge fan of the press down dispensing application though.",neutral
sticky. like a glue to stitch my eyelids together. i love most of the black tea line products from fresh. but this one is really disappointing.,neutral
i really like this product! a little bit goes a long way and it works really well layered in with other skin care products. it definitely cuts down on a lot of redness but also absorbs well into the skin. i got some as a sample and i will be buying more!,positive
"i had so much hope for this sunscreen, i love the texture, how light weight, and how the product feels because it reminds me a bit of an over favorite sunscreen which was discontinued years ago. but as a person who has facial hair i find it very hard to find sunscreens that work with my beard facial hair. on days and weeks where i am not clean shaven, pilling happens, which i absolutely hate when i look for in a sunscreen. but on the couple days my face is cleanly shaven the product applies and sinks in well to the skin without pilling. i gave it stars because it is great without facial hair, but not so great when i have it.",neutral
"please bring back the old formula! i had just found laneige and fallen in love with their line, and then they changed this daily moisturizer. this one leaves a sticky residue, while the last one was the best moisturizer i would ever found.",negative
"i like this product so far. it definitely leaves your skin feeling baby soft and glowing. it also did not burnsting at all, which is rare for me when i use aha products! the test will be how it works over time.my issue is not with the size and price. if you look up most of the ahas sephora sells, they are also oz in larger packaging and cost more than this i.e. de, biossance, first aid beauty to name a few. i just do not like the packaging. i wish it were a pump or pipet so you could ration out how much you use. i feel like i am going to pour out half the bottle unintentionally and waste it.",positive
the hydration was there i guess but the smell of the product was so bad that all i could think about was washing my face immediately,negative
honestly this made my skin feel more dry it was quite an uncomfortable experience,neutral
"-but i just could not. pros i absolutely love the packaging! cons i liked the scent but it was so strong i would catch a whiff of it hours after i applied. i am thinking it is the perfume that was making me break out and my skin is not sensitive! i normally have no problem with products like this and i had such high hopes that it would help my skin, but every time i applied it i broke out in small white pimples. i tried giving my skin a break every few days and trying different weeks throughout the month thinking maybe it was a hormone issue, but nothing helped except to stop using it.",negative
"perfect for my combination skin. keeps my skin hydrated, soft, and clear. this is my go-to!",positive
"i am not sure why its taken me this long to write a review on this product. i am on my th bottle and this stuff does not quit. i have recently started using it on a dump face and the results are amazing. it leaves the skin looking dewy and smooth, and the slightly sticky texture is perfect for layering other products on top and applying flawless makeup. definitely worth a try and you definitely cannot beat the price!",positive
this is awful for oily skin. do not use this if you have oily skin or it will leave white streaks of sunscreen and oil on your face half way through the day. applied in the morning and by afternoon i had a small collection of white oil on my chin. definitely do not wear under makeup if you have oily skin either!,negative
great product! the name speaks for itself- it feels natural on the skin leaving it clean and hydrated throughout the day! absorbes well so you only need a couple drops to last a day.,positive
i was pleasantly surprised by this product! it was very nice and i definitely saw a difference in my skin. my skin tone looks more even. i will say though i personally needed to use moisturizer to put on top of the product but besides that it is amazing!,positive
"this scrub smells nice, but it was very abrasive. the product is not for those with sensitive skin. i will likely just use this as a body scrub because it felt really rough on my face. i am also feels a bit overkill to have an aha in a face scrub.",neutral
"i really like using this spray. smells nice, good mister, gives a subtle glow. i do not think it is actually moisturizing though. more or less, a pampering part of my routine.",positive
i finally decided to go to a dermatologist and found out my acne was hormonal so this would not have helped it anyway. but i have combination skin and this product completely dried out my skin. returned.,negative
"pros ecoefficient packaging, and it is cute! when you run out, just throw away the pod and refill. it smells great! it is definitely moisturizing, and it left my skins feeling soft. cons felt a little too sticky for what i would want in a moisturizer and is very thick. i have combination skin and i felt it left my skin feeling oilier than normal. after just days of use i had small outbreaks on my cheeks, and i never break out in my cheeks. not even my makeup primer, eye shadow primer and makeup setting spray could keep the oils at bay after using this. overall while this is a long wear and heavy duty moisturizer, i do not recommend if you have combination or oily skin. it may smell great, but and i love that it is got sustainable packaging, but this will not get to change from my other moisturizer. if you have dry skin however, this may be a great moisturizer for you. unfortunately, based on my experience, this only rates at stars. i received this as a complimentary free item to try from influenster for testing purposes.",neutral
"i have been using this consistently for almost months, and i have seen no difference in my acne scars or dark spots. i do not use any other actives and keep my skin very hydrated. really wanted to love this but it just did not do anything for me",negative
there is something about the way this makes your face feel.... it is incredible! cannot get enough,positive
"this product destroyed my skin. i received this as part of my sephora birthday gift and was so excited. it literally ruined my life. i have never had acne before, only a few spots here and there. the instant i started using this, i got the worst break out of my life and have not been able to get rid of it ever since. i want to cry every day that i wake up and see how red and awful my skin is. do yourself a favor and do not use this. i wish i could go back in time and throw it out even faster than i did.",negative
"beautiful texture but broke me out on my eyelid and under eye. i enjoyed the texture but could not get past getting a pimple on my eyelid!?. as a lot of others have noted, there seems to be a lot of perfume in this, which always amazes me given how sensitive the skin around our eyes is. sadly had to return.",neutral
definitely hydrates my skin! do not use if you have super oily skin! would buy again!,positive
"this toner has been an absolute game changer in my daily routine, i have been using about a month now and within the first week my skin felt smoother, softer, hydrated, and i noticed my redness begin to even out. i received this complimentary for testing purposes but will be repurchasing on my own.",positive
my skin has never felt so soft. i have very dry skin with a few fine lines starting. after one night of this i have much more moisturized skin and i genuinely feel like the lines look a little less noticeable. i am obsessed and thank god i am considering the price,positive
this product really makes the skin glow! it also really helps removes those pesky dark spots. the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because of the lemony smell. if you like that smell than you will not have any other problem with it!,positive
"i recommend with reservation. i wanted to love the entire regimen, but it was just too much for my skin. i was excited about the simplicity, eco friendly packaging and nice smell. however, what stands out in my mind is the two weeks it took to recover from the red stinging breakout that ensued. maybe just test on a very small patch. if it works for you it is definitely a better plan than the- step regimens of many of the other lines.",neutral
this does not absorb into my skin very well. it just leaves a greasy film over the area of application. perhaps someone who has very dry skin might enjoy this product. i will continue to use this product until i run out because the oiliness does not seem to have a negative impact on my skin and i paid a lot of money for it. my eye area looks super greasy and shiny not a cute look at all! so i will only use it before bed when no one can see how crazy i look. i do not think i will be repurchasing this eye cream once the jar is empty.,neutral
"after wearing this product for a month i have noticed no changes in my under eye area. i have tried this product with and without makeup, with other eye moisturizers, by itself and with different moisturizers. after reading another review that it did help with the wrinklesfine lines on the reviewer i attempted that as well but saw no improvement or change. i was so hopeful about this product as i have used other ole henriksen products in the past and really enjoyed them. the product feels more like a primer than an eye gel creme. i noticed no improvement or change in the texture, wrinkles, color or tone under my eyes. this product is beautifully packaged and the creme in the bottle is just stunning, but to me that is all this is, just a beautifully packaged product.",negative
"this mask is a keeper. it does reduce the size of my pores for the day. i use it at night. in the morning they are visibly smaller and my skin feel great. my pores do not magically disappear like i wish, but this product is the best out of every that i have tried.",positive
"it smells great and i like the tingle feeling however, it leaves my skin feeling sticky afterwards and it is unbearable. i will not buy this again, as i have used products that are much more effective in the past that did not leave my skin feeling so gross.",neutral
"it is a serum that adds shine to the face but i bought it in order to reduce some dark marks that i had from some pimples and i have already been using it for a month and in that sense i have not seen changes, the marks are still intact, i will continue to use it for more time to see if i can see the expected results",negative
been using this product day and night now for about a week. i am super happy with my results. i apply it after my toner. and before my moisturizer by pressing it into my skin. i have combination skin type and i am in my late s. i am of latina and of african american decent.,positive
"i tried this to compare it to the drunk elephant portion peptide moisturizer. sadly it does not compare. texture is thinner, and it smells really chemically.... and diaper-ish lol. definitely not as luxurious or moisturizing but then again look at the price. not worth it i am going to.",neutral
love it! this really gets off my makeup. i do wear a lot of eye makeup and this gets it all off and does not sting my eyes and does not dry out my skin. i think this will take me forever to get through since a little goes a long way. i definitely will repurchase in the future.,positive
i love this product. i have sort of olive skin with pink undertones so finding bronzing and self tanning products that do not make me orange is hard. i mix equal parts of this and oat lotion and it gives me a perfect glow that did not transfer to my clothes or sheets. love it love it and the color matches what i get from the isle of paradise face tanning drops in medium.,positive
"i am deep in the throes of a retin a purge and my face is incredibly sensitized, peeling, the whole deal. i live in fear of that sunscreen sting on my vulnerable skin and had to seek out all new products. this is a joy to use, no irritation, totally clear out of the bottle and so never even a temporary white cast, and it soaks in pretty quickly so i am not waiting for it to set down or forcing it to do so. woo hoo!",positive
"i got this once i started going to the gym more and just quickly wanted to do a quick face wash in the gym after my workout. it got the job done for me to be able to finish errands throughout the day without feeling grimey. i am more oily, so the fact that this is milky just let us me put on sunscreen and i am hydrated enough. there is no scent to this. the texture is like runny, creamy milk- i know, odd that yeah. you do not need lots depending on what you are removing. i only use sunscreen and i am getting rid of the sweat so that is as far as i am using this product. sometimes my friends and i get drunk and we paint our eyelids euphoria style and this has always gotten off the make up! i would use a cotton pad and drop like- depending on desired saturation and just rub the pad so the product gets absorbed by the pad and just gently rub around. i clean around my eyes, it has not gotten me irritated yet. leaves me feeling very refreshed and ready for sunscreen or facial spray. depends how spicy i am feeling",positive
"it is alright. i much prefer zincscreen for the tint it leaves. this one is not particularly sheer, though i appreciate it is better than others and is mineral. good for underneath makeup.",neutral
"i received this product to review from influenster. it was not something i would have picked up on my own, but i was very pleasantly surprised. i have combination skin normally oils make my face really oily or feel just plain slimy, this one absorbs really nicely. it leaves just a hint of an oil feeling but sinks in quite quickly. it smells like real roses, a little goes a really long way. it took me just drops for my whole face. the only reason it is stars instead of is because it still leaves my forehead oily for those with combination skin i might advise saving it to use in winter. the packaging is really sleek i am really pleased i got to try this product.",positive
"i will start with the good which are that it has a pleasant smell and the dropper format is very easy to use and mix in with lotion. now for the bad news, i used- drops per arm and leg and- for my torso and went to sleep. when i woke up i literally thought i had forgot to add the tanning drops, that is how pale i still looked. the next night i decided to try it again, this time mixing drops in with my lotion per leg a nd arm and drops for my torso. the next morning, once again, i looked barely darker. the only spots i could tell i was darker was from a streaky ring around my armpits. yikes...opt loving tan instead.",negative
"it was just okay. i liked the c.e.o. serum better to brighten my skin and hyper pigmentation. many people did not like the smell, but to me it smelled good like lemon grass. i tried it over a year ago, so i actually want to give it a try one more time and be really consistent with it.",neutral
"i have been using this for a at least a month now with little improvement. the blackheads on my nose have slightly improved, but it has not done much to treat my hormonal acne everywhere else. this serum is so sticky that i find myself dreading using it every night. i do not think i would be able to use it during the day because of the smell... literally smells like a bottle of thyme off of the spice rack. kind of off-putting. hard pass on this one.",negative
"let me be frank--i am not impressed. this product is o.k at best. it is decent for covering up surface level skin redness and irritation, but i would advise against using it as an all out, treatment. in my brutally honest opinion, it is more of a glorified concealer. while the green to beige technology suits my skin-tone just fine, i can totally see how this product limits itself in accessibility to other more fair or even darker skin tones. pros contains spf protection, is lightweight and buildable. the product is perfect for covering minor skin imperfections not otherwise easily concealed. made of natural ingredients, relatively odorless, and safe on sensitive skin. con non-universal color not a corrector of color but rather a concealer messy difficult application and leaves face feeling greasy.i will be honest, i do not have severe enough redness in my face to feel like the product is truly earth shattering for me... however, that does not mean it would not be effective on the skin of someone who truly suffers from severe uneven skin tone or redness. this may very well be one of those you have to try it for yourself types of situations. on that note, i do recommend you try it for yourself! it may just be the best thing ever... or just another product you may never end up using again. you will have to try it to find out!",negative
"love how fresh my face feels after using it! also, it is light but moisturizing. i have combo skin and it is very sensitive, i did not have any allergic reactions. overall, amazing product",positive
"i do not recommend this products to anyone, yea it takes off your makeup but it does not, help your skin, you still have left over dirt and how the bottle is made, is designed for you to push out more product than you should use. not made very well.",negative
"one of my absolute favorite products, i have acne prone skin and i use this at least once a week alongside other products especially if i feel my pores being clogged. i love this more than their out of trouble mask and i put so many people on it, i would definitely purchase again!!",positive
i have been using it for over a month now. it only works when you see a red spot starting to grow. it does not make the acne to go away at all but it dries out the skin to the point that skin starts exfoliating but the acne will remain there! it prevents the acne from growing bigger. it does not help with the spot.,neutral
this moisturizer is amazing! it is lightweight but still super moisturizing. i have some hormonal acne and some scarring and it does a great job at soothing redness. the only reason why i did not give it stars is because of the packaging. the pump does not get everything and leaves lots of product behind unless you find a way to scrape it out.,positive
"i tried this kiehls ferulic brew antioxidant facial treatment for a couple of weeks. the formula is nice and smooth, not oily- which is great. easy to apply and does not feel heavy at all. although i did not notice any of the benefits suggested, it is a pleasant serum and i would use it again.",neutral
i do not know...i started using this for a little extra security because i did not have much pimples.. now i got a huge one and proceeding to get more small ones. i do not know. i thought this was good and gentle because it is only a cleanser and i only use it every other night but.....i do not know i am really upset because my skjn was doing so good for weeks and this just brought me back to square one. i kind of want to cry but i do not know i will try it for a few more days. if it is still getting worse i am not using it anymore.,negative
"uhmmm..... i gave it stars because it did not break me out, very gently, smell good and not dry out my skin. but it does not exfoliate at all, just basically clean the face. it should be good for someone with very sensitive skin. if you want a real exfoliation cleanser, this one is not. sorry fresh, i love you but not this time",neutral
i wanted to love this product. it is not good for my skin sensitive and slightly dry. i do not believe it was the niacinimide per say but possibly the zinc or preservatives used. i have used the inkey list niacinimide with no issues. i cannot say i recommend this product or not as my skin is sensitive and particular and this may not be a issue with others.,negative
"this night cream is like butter, thick and very hydrating. for my mixt to oily skin it is really too heavy. it made my face really shiny and oily. i will not buy this again, but for someone with very skin this could be good iguess. also, the price is decent for the amount.",neutral
my new go to cleansing balm! ill probably switch between this one and the clean it zero by banila co all time fave,positive

"this is sticky as heck i can feel it on my skin. a bit too shiny for me too, i prefer a matte finish so i do not think it would work under makeup for me. wanted to try a new mineral sunscreen, but i have never found another one i like besides algenist sublime defense. wasted my money",negative
"i just got this from boxy pop up for a really discounted price and upon first use i am obsessed with how soft my skin c around my eyes feels after using a swipe on each under eye area. i am so happy i got this, although i do not think i would pay the full price i will definitely snatch anything from this brand during a sale. i really want to try this entire line.",positive
"i absolutely love this moisturizer. from the first time i started using it to almost a month later my skin has changed dramatically. my skin is softer and more hydrated. it is a thick texture, but does not clog my pores. a little goes a long way with it.",positive
"the night serum is a great product for long term use. it leaves the skins texture supple to the touch and brightens the tone. the appearance of lines and wrinkles becomes blurred with continued use. this is a great product for night time use. the price leaves something to be desired which is why i am grateful for the free sample. for those of us with a need for quality and longevity this is the answer. however, we under the umbrella of working class or poor cannot afford this particular finery. if you have got the money and need a great night serum i recommend this one.",positive
"the smell is so god awful that i might have to stop using it. i can continue to smell it a long time after application, even after applying a nice smelling face cream.",neutral
"serum is ok. would not say it is better than some of the other serums i have used for fine lane and wrinkles. the packaging looks great but is awful to use. the twist cap does not open easily all the time and now gets stuck so when i turn the cap to open, serum sprays out without pushing the pump down.",neutral
it is definitely very drying even though it is supposed to be moisturizing i have been trying it for a couple weeks. i have moderately dry skin i have never had a cleanser make my skin feel super tight after like this. if you do not have dry skin this should work fine. i liked the gentleness consistency feeling of it. wish it worked for me.,neutral
great lower priced toner mist. i love how this product can keep my skin looking hydrated for- hours and how it pairs well with my other skin care products. the only problem i have run into is that if you have oily skin and use this product before applying make up you have to use a matte primerfoundation or else your face get very oily after hours. but i found that applying it at night or on lightno makeup days it worked very well. those with drynormal skin could probably use the product without problem but anyone with oilycombination might have to finesse the product a little. as some one who goes through a lot of toner mists i like this one for the price and overall skin benefits.,positive
i cannot justify the price tag. this moisturizer also goes very quickly since it is so think and clumps together. i almost thought i got a bad batch because of the waxy consistency. i much prefer tatchas moisturizers if you are going to drop that much,neutral
i have not noticed any noticeable change in wrinkles. but can use it as a moisturizing one here and there.,neutral
"psychologically, i feel like my skin is being plumped and dewed up. however, in reality....not so much difference as far as i can tell. i call it my unicorn water because i want to believe in unicorns and love them,but never really see them in real life. i think the same thing kind of goes on with this stuff. makes you feel pretty, but it basically is overpriced spring water.",negative
"i love til products but this one was a miss. it does not remove eye makeup. i had to use another cleanser to take it off. once i was done, went over with a cotton pad that had my toner, and there is the leftover foundation. instructions were followed. nothing beats their oat cleanser.",neutral
"i think product neither helps nor harms. i received it for free in an influenster voxbox and i was excited to try it. it is a high quality eye cream for sure. the consistency is creamy without being too heavy or tacky and it does hydrate the under eye area. i do not feel like it is a miracle worker at reducing dark circles. i think my under eye area looks the same and i have been using this product for weeks now. for, i would pass. i think you achieve the same results with a cheaper eye cream.",neutral
"lathers well, cleanses well but is drying. if you have dry skin, there are gentler and less drying cleansers out there.",positive
i have been using this product every day for the past months and i have legit seem a huge change in my under eyes! i am mediterranean and naturally get very dark and puffy circles under my eyes. nothing has ever helped until this product. i promise it is worth a try!,positive
"i have used these patches on separate occasions week apart. they are a good quick fix to noticeable lines. i used mine on my nasal labial folds and dang! they did do some plumping!! the only caveat is that this effect is temporary. it lasts a good- dayamazing day lessens over the next couple. i wonder if used in conjunction with fillers if it would help extend the time they last... but, i do not know? i would definitely use these if i had a special occasion to go to like a wedding where you do not want any extra lines showing in photos. all in all? i made sure to wear mine hrs was strangely comfy and it did it is job. highly recommended!",positive
"i love the banana bright vit c so i bought a deluxe sample pack with this moisturizer to give this a go. sadly, it really broke out my skin. i am sad because it did smell amazing!",negative
"note i first received the mini version in a monthly beauty box which is how i find most of my favorite products, and my general skincare rule is always try the mini if it is an option before purchasing the full size, so i recommend this to you all too. everyone is skin is unique and often unpredictable, so i do not want to lead anyone astray! that said, i am on my second full size jar of this cream and i absolutely love it.pros it is very creamy and nourishing without being greasy. it has not irritated my skin at all or increased redness which comes and goes at random for me. i have a subtle glow now that i did not have before. i love that it and the brand overall is vegan and cruelty free. it has a strong, amazing scent which is a bonus for me, but i know fragrance is a con for some people, so if that is you then i would def suggest a different product. cons there are honestly no cons for me except maybe that it takes a while to absorb and can be a bit sticky before it does, but it is no worse than what you would expect from any heavy cream. it is in no way a dealbreaker! just please learn from me and do not put your face too close to your furry friend right after applying if you are using this to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles then i cannot speak to its effectiveness, but if you are looking for prevention then i would def recommend it. this is what i have been using it for and so far it has worked, and it has not interferedclashed with anything else i use toner, serums.",positive
gifted by biossance. i got to try this squalene bha toner by biossance and overall i do not care for the product. it did a really nice job cleaning my pores but it has a light herbal scent i do not care for- with the lime i would of thought it would have a lime scent to it. it gave me a dry area between my brows and left an odd residue on my face... almost like a light oil or slick feel? i am use to toners that are cleansing but do not leave a residue even though they can be a little drying. i had higher hopes for this product.,negative
"eye creams are usually not worth it to me, but wow, this one really works!! gets rid of fine lines and puffiness whenever i use it in the morning! would recommend",positive
i will stop using this brand coz did not work at all. i have been using this over a month but i did not see anything changes on my face. it gives me break out and nothing brightening.,negative
"first impression-wise, the packaging is stunning. it is extremely bling-bling and eye-catching, just like j lo herself. that being said, this cleanser comes in a shiny rose-gold tube, that although pretty, is not entirely practical. due to its oblong wide but thin shape, it does not stand up very well as a tube next to the sink. even if you try to stand it up, the tube leaks from the hole due to gravity. in the end, you have to lay it flat to avoid leakage and it ends up with a large footprint next to my sink.the gel-cleanser itself is pretty too, a gel-cream cleanser that is rosy with gold shimmer. it makes for a decadent experience putting pretty formula on your face. at a glance, the ingredient list seems solid too, with japanese knotweed root, glycolipids, coconut and rice bran, and a blend of oils. i do like how this cleanser is free from parabens, formaldehydes, sulfates, and other harmful compounds. the fragrance of the cleanser is nothing to write home about. it is okay and smells like soap. i did like that it is not overly fragrant, because i prefer a milder scent. in this case, the list states that only less than one percent of synthetic fragrance is used. i rather they wipe out even the less than one percent synthetic fragrance factor, but it cannot be helped, i suppose.the formula and texture of the gel-cream cleanser is easy to spread and rub on skin and it does a good job removing visible impurities like make-up and sweat without completely stripping your face of necessary essential oils. that being said, like all cleansers, make sure to moisturize afterwards because i feel this is cleanser is on the strong side and does remove a lot of oils on your face. it is good to replenish it with a clean moisturizer afterwards for good results. over all, i liked this cleanser a lot and do recommend it to people with oilier skin. i am really considering trying the rest of jlos beauty line.this product was received as a complimentary sample from influenster.",positive
starting off by saying that i have normal to oily skin. my skin loves this!!! bhas do not do much for me other than irritate my skin so to find a serum that is aha only was so exciting. there was a slight sting and burning feeling the first couple times i used this but it never lasted long. the biggest difference i saw with this was in my pore size and that is my biggest problem area so that made me happy. this also really helped with my skin texture and those little problematic acne bumps. my favorite thing about this item is actually how moisturizing it is!!! on nights i put this on my skins care routine was so quick cuz this is like a one and done type of product.,positive
"unfortunately this product did not work for me. after continuous use, i saw little results but had itching and then little red bumps and rashes on my skin. i know it was from this because i was not using any other product in the area i used this. i love the ordinary but unfortunately this product was not for me.",negative
"do not think we did not notice that you are charging the same price for what used to be. oz, and is now. oz. come on origins.",negative
smells nice and not too drying but it does leave a sticky bit of a feeling. it works great for under a moisturizer but i do not love it under makeup,neutral
"it is not bad, honestly. i thought it would be sticky since the texture seems quite goopy, but nope. it goes on smooth and dries nicely. it does not smell like watermelon though...more like cut up vegetables or real cucumber. i doubt that would deter anyone from getting it, but wanted to mention that. if you need a regular toner, this is not a bad choice esp since it is cruelty free.",neutral
i have wanted to try la mer for years and i finally did. honestly i was not impressed at all. la mer is such a thick consistency and i really cannot tell a difference in my skin by using it. i am a product junkie so i thought i would love this stuff.. sadly it will not be a repeat buy for me.,negative
i have been using this eye cream for- days. it has a cream-gel texture so my skin absorbs very well. from the first week i could notice that it hydrates and moisturizes my eye contour very well and my skin feels and looks firmer. definitely it is a very good eye cream.,positive
"so this spf has a lot of good things going for it. it is spf, includes hyaluronic acid, and protects from uva and uvb rays. uvb rays are the typical rays of sun that can give you a sunburn. but uva rays are actually more harmful because they penetrate glass so even when you are inside by a window and contribute to aging. it is feels lightweight on the skin, does not have fragrance, and did not break me out. however, i have oily skin and this spf felt very oily on my face pretty much all day long. every time i touched my face my fingers felt oily and if i ever touched my face and then touched my eyes, i felt a slight burn from the spf. definitely not my favorite sunscreen for my oily skin.",neutral
"i unfortunately do not like this product and because of it, i am too afraid to use anything else with ha in it. i heard you are supposed to apply it on a damp face but i used it on dry skin and really did not like the stickiness. it did not really do anything for my skin so i suggest looking to see if this product is good for your skin type before jumping on the bandwagon",negative
best mask i have ever tried!!! it made my face so soft and luminous! it made my blemishes goes away. i have dry skin and this help a lot and made my skin feel so glowy and bouncy i swear!! love it and would totaly repurshase it,positive
love these pads. works great on my face feel so refreshing and i have no bad reaction to it.,positive
not at all moisturizing. nice idea but i just layered another cream over it because as soon as it set my face felt tight and dry. might work in the summer but definitely not in winter. added a star because i have very sensitive skin and it did not break me out so...i guess that is good.,negative
"everyone needs a peelexfoliating routine--this is all you need. cut out any scrubs or abrasive exfoliants you are using on your face and stick with this. i have used this for nearly a year and though i sometimes forget to do it weekly, that is how often it is recommended you use this.",positive
this moisturizer was very dry and and i am usually oilycombo so when i put this on and it dried... it dried dried like i did not feel it do anything hydrating to my face even with all these reviews i am extremely disappointed in this product i had to exchange it quick because i did not want a dry face.,negative
"i have combination sensitive skin but i was so excited to try this face wash. after just a week of using, it dried out my skin to a whole other level!! i developed dry patches around my eyes edge of my lips that are still in the healing process of healing. not made for all skin types",negative
"ahh i am giving it stars because i do not know how i feel about it. i want to love it but i did not really notice any drastic results from these honestly. i do not have bad acne but i do get tiny little pimples here and there but i put these dots over them over night and i saw no changes honestly. and for the price of dollars basically, and you are only getting twenty dots. that is very expensive. i literally used whole patch of dots in one night.. then i am left with and that is it, that is not even long enough for a treatment to notice improvement. if came for dollars then okay sure it would be a better take but literally you use a whole patch in one night. it is just not worth that type of money because i would need to use them personally every night for a week for it to fully go away. so a little disappointed to be honest.",negative
this product has nice packaging. i received it for free for reviewing purposes. it made my skin feel very hydrated and smooth.,neutral
"i do like this product, but could you find a dupe for cheaper at the drug store? definitley. it does not do anything extraordinary for me other than the way it looks and how it sprays. it is lightly moisturizing, i do still feel like i need to put more on my face after applying. it sort of has an interesting smell, nothing overpowering but just unexpected. i guess i just feel like i expected more out of this product.",positive
"super hydrating! although the price tag on it does not reflect the results, i would recommend for everyone to try it because everyone is skin is different and sings their own time. i just would not pay the price for my skin",neutral
i had some dry spots due to my retinol product and winter weather. this product has healed my skin. i am so glad the sephora sale clerk suggested it. i will sing it is praises and would suggest it to anyone living where winters get extreme.,positive
"i like this product, but it has too many negatives for me to love it. i love that the watermelon scent covers the self tan smell during application and that it feels nice on my skin. i also like that it does give me a tan. however, i wish it was more gradual. i do not like how it gets very dark and unnatural looking near my joints. i also found it a bit irritating to my skin.",neutral

did not change anything for me despite consistent use,negative
i only like using clean products on my face so i thought this would be the perfect toner. this toner broke me out so bad a week after using it. the bumps on my face are huge. i am disappointed because i simply wanted to hydrate my face more. i will never purchase this brand again.,negative
"i really wanted to like this product, but my skin said no.this broke me out and clogged my pores really bad. also i did not find it very moisturizing, my skin felt a bit dried and it just had a weird feel overall. i returned it after two weeks of use.",negative
"i normally use the vinesource serum but thought about giving this a try and using something new. so i am glad i did at least try. i love caudalie products so this was still a nice purchase. when they say this creates a matte lookfeeling, they are not kidding! my face felt so tight after each use but with that it felt extremely dry even with the additional serums and moisturizers i use- my face just felt dry all the time. i do not think it mixed well with my skin type. however, i was not disappointed in my purchase because i know the quality of caudalie, just was not the product for me and my combination skin type. so maybe i would stay away from this if you are prone to dry skin because i think it would just intensify it but i think it did its job!",neutral

"i received the sunday riley stars retinol eye serum complimentary in exchange for a review. thank you sunday riley for the opportunity to test this product.this is an anti-aging treatment targeted for wrinkles around the eyes the serum contains retinoids to buildup collagen, niacinamide to support ceramide production and target hyperpigmentation, and madecassosside to soothe skin. poppy seed extract and ceramides help plump the skin and reduce dark circles. it is vegan, fragrance free and cruelty free.the serum is in a tube with a ceramic applicator that is cooling to the skin and helps spread the serum around the eyes. i love how this feels. i have not seen any changes in my wrinkles but it is helped moisturize my eye area and i have not had any adverse reactions. the serum absorbs quickly into the skin and does not irritate my eyes.i have been using it every night since i got it and i can tell this is going to be a favorite. this is the first sunday riley product i have tried and so far i am loving it.",positive
"i received this cream as a freeproduct from topbox. the packaging is beautiful however as soon as i opened it the fragrance hit me. the texture of this cream is quite nice and it sinks into my skin pretty quickly. my skin felt a bit warm after applying it and i assume this is due to the fragrance. my skin did not appear any more hydrated than it was upon starting the cream, and i much prefer my honey halo moisturizer.",neutral

i have noticed my dark spots lighten! only product i have used where i see a noticeable difference! does not break out my sensitive skin.,positive

did nothing at all for my skin except layered and flaked under other products.,negative

"the only downside to this product is it is very high price tag. other than that, it is a perfect addition to my skincare. i have super oily skin like getting oily mid-makeup application and this stuff has helped balance that. i know it is this product specifically because i only introduce one new product in my routine at a time which is every month or so. the bottle is heavy and feels very luxurious. i would recommend if you have the dough to spend!",positive
so gentle yet incredibly effective!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
i would not suggest this cleanser for sensitive skin. the bamboo stem powder is pretty course for delicate facial skin. the enzymes did not do much either unfortunately. i will def continue to use it as a body scrub so it is not a waste.,neutral
"this product is super greasy. it made my foundation separate because of how oily it is. i tried to use translucent powder after i applied it to see if that would help my foundation not to separate. another time, i also tried using a primer in addition to the translucent powder and i just could not get it to work for me. my skin is dry, so generally i can usually get away with using a product with a little bit of oil and my foundation is still great, but with this one, i just could not get it to work for me. the other issue i have is that it is super fragrant, and i do not like to use products with fragrance on my face. do not get me wrong, it has a gorgeous scent, but i am generally not a fan of skincare products that use fragrance in them.",negative

"i received this product as part of a free sample program. the one asset of this cleansing bar is that it smells great and the scent lasts. i found the scent lasts on my skin more than normal cleansing bars do, especially the ones made for women. it also lathers very well. my skin does not feel better hydrated but it also does not feel dried out, so it is average on that front. i do prefer it as a facial cleanser over a body soap. just personally think it works better as a face cleanser than the all-over cleanser it is meant to be.",neutral

"i received this product for free testing from influester and jlo beauty to start this mask was a very wet mess out of the bag. it took a bit to untangle and separate the parts. while two parts sounds okay it actually made it a little harder to put on overall. as with all mask fit will change for everyone is face. but the bottom looping over both ears is difficult and somewhat uncomfortable, i ended up leaving it looped on one ear only. over both it also did not cover the side of my nose and parts of my cheeks. it was just stretched to far. the mouth hole could also be longer.the mask itself is extremely wet, which makes it stick to your face well. but being in a colder climate that wetness is a little uncomfortable and has that feeling of wet hands or hair going out in the cold, a slight sting.i would recommend having tissues nearby for when you remove the mask. the directions say to massage the residue into your face, but there is a lot left on your face when you remove it. you can massage it all in eventually or it just dries. but you will also see residue or skin peeling, there is just too much left after removing the mask. the residue left also is a bit tacky feeling left on your face.overall i did not notice anything with my face that made these mask stand out. it mainly seemed the same as me applying my normal moisturizer just with a lot more hassle. pretty much i would not recommend these mask. the closest i can get is if you are someone who likes using mask try it and see if it is better for you, but if you rarely or are someone not big into mask i would recommend a good moisturizer over this. it is also extremely expensive for an less than to average mask at dollars per mask.",neutral
"i honestly do not use it enough to see a difference and that is because i have realized that every time i use it, pimples pop up around my eye area which is super rare for me. so acne pronesensitive skin beware",negative

"got this at shoppers drug mart and it is seriously a miracle.i took accutane for months years ago, i tried proactive, strong prescribed acid ointment, birth control, benzagel, cetaphil, etc., but the clinique acne solutions clearing gel really helps control my adult hormonal acne. excellent for acne caused by masks too. you can use it multiple times a day on your spots, even over your other skincare products, to clear the acne faster and it still will not dry out your skin. i wear it on top of my anti-oil moisturizer and after toning my face, and it clears up well.will definitely rebuy.",positive
"after reading all the reviews and all the hype, i decided to spend my hard earned money on this product with high hopes. almost stars, this product must be life changing, right? wrong. i have been using this for months, religiously. i have oily, acne prone skin by the way. sure, my skin is soft right after, so what? it is also soft after my morning routine. other than that, no difference at all. my pores are not any smaller, my skin is not glowing and my skin is not any better. really disappointed! waste of!!! maybe it works for people with already perfect skin. but for us oily, acne prone gals, forget about it!",negative
"if coconut oil breaks you out, do not usebuy. i could not figure out why this oil consistently breaks me out- i have pretty good skin that hardly breaks out anymore. then i googled the first ingredient capryliccapric triglyceride. this is mctcoconut oil! which is known for being comedogenic aka pore clogging... it is a no for me.",negative
"i am so loving this serum, it took me about days to really notice the change, but my skin feels amazing, i have dark spots and freckles which i struggle with, this definately made a huge difference in my skin tone and pores. i am really excited to see how my skin feels and looks after a full week of using it.",positive

"i was super excited to try this product, i have got super dry skin and nothing seems to work for me. i when i first used the product i really liked it. my face felt super soft and hydrated and i thought i finally found a product that worked for my dry skin. after about a week of using it i noticed that my skin was nit doing better. it was not getting enough hydration and i had to mix the oil with a bunch of other products to feel like my skin was getting what it needed. i just do not think it is anything special. maybe it would work better for someone with combo skin.",neutral
"i did not notice a huge difference in my skin, but what really got to me was the smell. i am sure i was just smelling the copper but it smells like my high school chemistry lab and i could not get past that.the product itself was fine and if you do not mind the smell it might be for you. it was not for me.",neutral
"recieved a travel size of this in a sample gift pack and i have been loving it. i only really use eye creams for hydration and moisture before makeup application, because my under eye area gets very dry, so i cannot really speak to it is wrinkle smoothing abilities also i am so not a current concern of mine. but if you are looking for a great eye cream that hydrates and moisturizes the under eye area, this is a great option! if you want to spend the money! i probably would not purchase the full size because it is and i do not like to spend on eye creams, but i will thoroughly enjoy using the travel size until it runs out!",positive
"i love supergoop. this is one of my essentials. quickly sinks into my skin so i do not feel greasy or sticky, just moisturized. and the formula leaves me with a nice glow. the best!",positive
this has been a nice cleanser. my dry skin does not get irritated and i do not feel like it is stripping my skin. i do not feel like it effectively removes makeup though. after washing my face with this i still saw makeup residue and sometimes in large patches. so i do not use this as a makeup remover but as a second cleanse. and for that it works perfectly. my face feels clean and refreshed.,positive
"pricey decent, but not great. i do not feel like it does a whole lot besides moisturize, and there are a plethora of essences out there with added benefits both at and below this price point.if you are not using anything at the moment and do not mind the splurge, this is a good, safe place to start. if you are willing to do a bit more research, you can definitely find better.",neutral

"i really loved the old formula. it was ph balanced and was able to cleanse my combination, sensitive, acne and rosacea prone skin without stripping it dry or making my skin break out. however, this new formulation is terrible. it is much harsher than before and dried my skin out while aggravating my rosacea and leaving my forehead with bright red patches and breakouts. i am terribly disappointed and do not understand why they felt the need to change a perfectly wonderful formula. i suspect if you have very oily skin that is not sensitive at all this might work for you but if you are anyone else i would stay clear.",negative
"it is an ok product. it is very overhyped though. i like it, but i prefer my old night cream better. i have dry skin in winter, but i am also on the oily side so i can only use this as a night cream. i use another lighter moisturizer and other serums and i use this to seal it in. i tried it on it is own and i did not feel like it was moisturizing enough, and it made my skin oily. it is heavy and you only need pump for your face and neck. again, it is ok i just do not know if i will miss it enough to repurchase.",neutral
"i received this as a freeproduct with trywithtopboxthe cream has a lovely, gentle and faint scent with a very light texture that soaks into the skin completely and does not leave any shine or residue. it makes my skin look dewey and glowing immediately after application. my skin was super dry around my nose and upper lip because i had been blowing my nose more often. this cream does not provide enough moisture for my skin, especially during the dry winter weather when i am not even leaving my home for the outdoors. maybe due to the hyaluronic acid, it made my skin texture more dry and rough so i had to stop using it every day. this cream is probably better suited for me in the spring or summer but needs to be supplemented with heavier creams if i want moisturehydration. the product comes in a heavy, glass-like container which makes it look like there should be more product inside. at least it has a flat circular top so you can stack something ontop of it.",neutral
"i have been using the serum along with the moisturizer cream, have sensitive skin, i love it so far. recommend it moistures your skin.",positive
"this is a decent cleanser, but is expensive for what it is. you can find a similar face wash at the drugstore, or a better face wash that is the same price as this. i did not find this to be stripping or irritating and it removed my makeup well, which is why i am rating stars knocked one off for the price. i will happily use my minitravel sizes when i receive them in kits, but this is not something i would purchase the full size of. i was also expecting the texture to be like jelly due to the product name, but was the texture of any standard cleanser.",positive
i absolutely love this product. it is apart of my depending on how my skin is that week daily skin routine. without this product my skin would not be so clear. anytime i have any kind of break out this product is guaranteed to take it away and keep it away. i highly recommend it. it is pricey but i promise it is worth it. i have normalcombination skin. i experience most breakouts in my cheek and jaw area due to maskne acne from wearing a mask all the time. these wipes along with any face wash with benzoyl peroxide and proper moisture after will clear your skin.,positive
"i am not very consistent with my skincare so maybe this review will not help much, but it feels light and refreshing on my skin.",positive
"i received this product complimentary from influenster and jlo beauty for reviewing purposes. my skin was extremely hydrated while the mask was on and it felt fresh. when i removed the mask, the residue started drying and my skin felt pulled. once it was completely dry, the product started peeling. i was expecting my skin to feel hydrated and soft but that was not the case",neutral
"disappointing waste of money. does not absorb and does not look glowy, it looks and feels greasy. such a waste of money. i really tried to love it. used it everyday for like months. not only would my skin feel dry at the end of the day, it has no longterm use benefits that i could see.",negative
i tried a sample at my local store and came home few hours later with no eye bags at all! super effective,positive

"i have been using this cream for about a week now and here are my thoughts. pros hydrating, fancy packaging. cons awful scent of aged cream, not absorbing well i have to wipe it off with a napkin. i do not like shinyoily face. overall i think this cream is pretty heavy and i would use it as a night cream or cold weather cream. also the texture is like a butter but cream. you literally need to use your nails to take it out of the jar. i do not think i would purchase it. i received this product for free for testing purposes.",neutral

"this is a great first cleanse to get off all of your makeup, eye makeup included! does not irritate my eyes and feels great on my dry skin. i like to buy the smaller size because it seems to last a long time and i do not like having big containers especially when traveling.",positive
did no harm but i did not notice a difference. probably would have to use it for weeks to notice anything--one sheet mask does not do much in general. nice amount of product but would not buy again. you are probably better off just buying a serum or moisturizer if you want to explore cica.,neutral

as someone with very oily skin i was so hesitant to try this but i love anything fresh and rose! i have been using this consistently for weeks and it is absolutely amazing! it does not leave me greasy and it actually feels more lightweight and breathable! will definitely pick up another bottle once i am done with this one because i am truly obsessed!!,positive
cannot believe they are charging almost for this. did absolutely nothing for my skin. waste of money.,negative

"when this line was announced, i was immediately drawn to this product. i really like the environmental sustainability of this product, i have never been a fan of cotton pads, and it is hard to find a good reusable alternative to cotton pads. this has the perfect consistency where all you need is your hands. the downside to this product is the definitely the fragrance. when i opened this product, it was loaded with fragrance. it was fragranced to the point of it being kind of unpleasant to use. not only the fragrance, the witch hazel. aside from the fragrance, i really enjoyed the feel of this product. it soaked into my skin beautifully, and it left me with a glowing complexion. for my skin personally, this was a very pleasant experience, but based on the irritants in this product, i cannot recommend it to people with sensitive skin.",neutral
"i do not understand what this product is doing for everyone elses skin?! i have been using this for months now pro a little goes a long way but i cannot say it is done anything for me. it has the consistency of water, and dries down absorbs? fine, but there are just no results, even with daily consistent use. i will say it has not aggregated my skin, but i will not be repurchasing.",negative
really nourishing cream that absorbed quickly into my normal to dry skin. very hydrating with a pleasant scent that dissipates. i get a lot of samples and this product-- despite its hefty price-- is one i have purchased repeatedly. i wait for sales to replenish my supply.,positive

"wanted to love, but only ok and quite frankly, not worth the money. i have fair skin, ordered the dark glow and it provided a nice color to my face but not as dark as i would hoped and not long lasting. a little bottle, it is not worth it to me. if money no object, go for it. i will probably purchase again if a sale. but, results marginal and cannot justify the cost.",neutral
received it as complimentary product from influenster. works way too good for being that cheap! good value and does not cake when you apply makeup over it,positive

"so disappointed- not sure how this has so many good reviews. it honesty smelled like nail polish remover, and putting it on my face made my eyes water instantly. the smell was so chemically and strong i doubt it was healthy for my skin. i wonder if mine was old or something but it was terrible! it dries fast leaving no time for it to actually treat my acne, and it is so so so so drying. wherever i applied it my skin felt tight and dry which only makes me more oily. none of my pimples went away and it did nothing to improve them whatsoever. returned after weeks.",negative
"serum was gifted by farmacy beauty. i wanted to really love this serum, but the texture and the scent it had was pretty off-putting to me. the texture is very oily and it has a pretty weird smell which made me not want to use it all the much. i would rather use my other vitamin c serums over this one unfortunately.",negative

"very irritating, stings and caused me to get very red and itchy. would not recommend!",negative
i have used this moisturizer for over a year and it never broke me out. i would use this alone and i would have dry patches and peeling on my forehead and mouth area consistently. i even started putting aquaphor on top for extra hydration. well i finally grew a brain and realized my skin was not super dry... it was this moisturizer! i switched products and in a matter of days my skin feels normal and hydrated.,negative
"it smells sooooo strong it is disgusting. really me face smells like a little girl perfume and it last. it is a big no from me. plus, it is really sticky and greasy. returning!",negative
i tried this out as an alternative to more expensive brands i usually purchase. i have used about half the jar and every time i use it i am underwhelmed. i feel like my skin is still oily afterwards and it does not really address any of my clogged pores or acne. i gave it star because it is refreshing and maybe it would work for people with less stubborn skin than mine. but if you are really looking for something that will seriously work for clogged pores and oily skin my suggestion is to spend the money and try something like the fresh umbrian clay mask.,neutral

"i received this sheet mask free from influenster and jlo beauty for testing purposes. the mask comes in pieces. a large lower piece for the jawline that loops around your ears twice and a small forehead piece. i had high hopes for the lower half of the mask to lift and tighten. but the loops around my ears were uncomfortable, and when i looked in the mirror the mask was pressing my left cheek downwards. despite the way the mask fit, the serum absorbed quickly and my skin was left glowing. my face was not sticky at all.i would prefer to apply the serumproduct directly over wearing this sheet mask.",neutral
i wanted to love this so much but unfortunately it burned my face. i tried using it for a couple weeks to see if my skin would adjust but nope. if you skin is not super sensitive and you are looking for a nice thick moisturizer definitely try this.,neutral
amazing. super hydrate. soft for sensitive skin. i use it with tatcha dewy serum. my skin just love it,positive
"i am years old and have cystic acne with mid-cycle hormonal flares, so i approached this product with realistic expectations. i do not think it is designed for cystic acne, but i decided to try it anyhow because i tried rather expensive patches designed specifically for cystic acne that did not work. i have used three dots each on two different cystic acne lesions at two different stages. when i used dots in the earliest apparent stage, i noticed the lesion did not swell to the point i expected it to though the duration of it was unchanged. when i used dots on a later stage like when you could be tempted to try to express some pus out but you know better because it is a cystic lesion, the dot performed like i expect it would on regular acne that forms a head i.e. it pulls the pus out and leaves the lesion much flatter and less angry. so far i would say this product is worth using. it is not a miracle, but it does not hurt, and may help more than the usual benzoyl peroxide and hydrocortisone cream combination i apply. plus, i do not run the risk of bleached spots on towels, pillow cases, etc. like i do with benzoyl peroxide.",neutral

i wanted to really try this out before giving my opinion. after weeks i must say that it works. right before i received this night serum i tried a toner that contained both glycoluc and lactic acid and that purge phase where you break out like crazy as a part of the cleansing process had me shook. i was really nervous about using this serum but it was nowhere near as bad as the toner. its starting to fade my dark marks and even helped with clearing the pimples that i got from that purge.,positive

"the texture of this is so rich and creamy, kind of thick but it melts into the skin beautifully. i pat it on around my entire eye as it absorbs and starts to feel thicker. my underyes are left super hydrated. the first time i used it under makeup my concealer definetely looked more flawless. i did not crease as much as i usually do. since then, this has been my go-to eye cream for under foundation in the morning because it goes so well under it. i just make sure to use spf. at night i use it along with my other retinol products. i have used it daily for about two weeks and my undereyes look more filled and plump. i have not seen visible results in terms of brightening yet. i received this eye cream complimentary from glow recipe and it has got me wanting to try more. it was a great way for me to get introduced to the brand.",positive
"i received these products from influenster and they are my favorite belif products i have ever used. neither of them leave a sticky residue and they both have a fresh, not overwhelming smell. i was very pleased with both of these and would purchase again.",positive
"i have acne on my cheeks and some scars so i was hoping this product would live up to the hype. i used it for a full week and now my skin has actually gotten worse, i now have very painful acne on my chin and on my jawline i never get acne there. this is the only new product i was using and the reason why i think this is the because of the acne is because about an hour after putting it on my skin or the serum starts to peel off and my face become unnaturally dry. i am just very disappointed, not sure if i am going to continue using it.",negative
i have tried several eye creams. i understand that skincare can be expensive but it is insane that eye cream costs more than a normal face cream. i had some lines under my eye and this cream made a huge difference within a couple of weeks. it has become my holy grail and works effectively getting rid of those lines.,positive
"finally a good product for my neck. i received this product in exchange for my honest review and there we go. i am really loving the product, it moisturizes my neck and i can see clearly the improvident of the lines. the cream has a thick texture but has great spreadability and it absolves fast. i like the scent and it feels super awesome on my skin.",positive
this is a great product! i love the texture. i have only used for about weeks now and not noticed a huge improvement but that is probably due to my skin condition. it also hydrate my super dry skin more and i love it! i recommend this product to anyone!,positive
"i have dry skin and live in a dry climate and thought this would provide a nice boost to my routine. on application it seemed to hydrate and felt very refreshing but definitely was not enough to moisturize my skin on it is own, so i would layer a thicker moisturizer on top of this. over time i noticed my skin was actually getting drier and drier. i also had been breaking out for a while and could not figure out what was causing it until i stopped using this product and stopped seeing new acne flare ups. i tried using it on my decolletage and sure enough started breaking out there too. the heavy fragrance smells lovely but two of the fragrance ingredients limonene and linalool are known to oxidize on air exposure and become allergenic aka not compatible with the jar packaging, and those are just the ones they listed and not the fragrance ingredients hidden under parfum. this just was not compatible with my skin and so far every laneige product i have tried i liked at first until i realized it was doing more harm than good.",negative
i have dry skin and it left my skin smooth. both my teenage daughters have used it and say it works well for acne pron skin.,positive
bought this before my upcoming trip for an-hr flight. i tried it on prior and in love with it. i used this last after my skin routine and left my skin very hydrated the next day. i definitely picked the right product for what i intended to use it for.,positive
"i am a skincare addict and have tried many products. this is a solid serum, but it is not for me. if all you care about is moisture and firmness you might like it. if you do not want something that may irritate your skin you will like this there is nothing harsh in it, no retinol, acid, fragrance. this will not do anything for you if your concern is texture and clogged pores it will not make it worse though!.the one thing i dislike about this is the over the top package. it feels expensive, but very tacky.",neutral
this is not the best but also not the worst cleansing balm i have ever used. i find you really have to rub it into your makeup to get it to actually break it up. it also leave a film on the eyes after trying to get off mascara.,negative
"this product definitely does not deliver hours of moisture. my eye skin feels annoyingly dry and tight by days end. as another user wrote, the pump delivers twice as much as needed each time also and it is impossible to deliver only half a pump amount. this product is not awful, but not worth the price and the wastefulness is frustrating. i will be returning it.",neutral
"seriously this stuff works! pop a pimple, but a patch on and the next day its gone. i am giving this a star because it can cause a circle on your skin to lighten where you left the patch on.",positive
i have dry to normal skin and this cleanser did not do anything for be but make me brake out. i do not like how it feels on my skin as well,negative
"i have very dry and sensitive skin, and this is one of the only moisturizers that will not break me out but still improves my skin.",positive
great product gentle but does the job. perfect for a night wash. when using do circle motions and do not press hard. the smell of this product is amazing as well.,positive
"found this to be terrible drying, cakes, barely covered redness. used on top of moisturizer and alone with no success. hard fail.",negative
"this product has done wonders for my skin. i actually am obsessed. no joke, this is just so lightweight and yet fluffy. so calming and refreshing. i would recommend to anyone with oily skin! i received this product complimentary of influenster and ole henriksen!",positive
"i did receive this product from influenster to review. i love the packaging. it is very luxe. i like the pump and that i do not have to stick my fingers in the cream. i like the consistency of the cream it goes on very easily and feels good on the skin. i feel like i need more moisture and my skin starts to feel tight after a few hours. my favorite moisturizer is the la mer creme de la mer and so that is what i am comparing this to. overall it is a nice moisturizer. but for this price point, i expect more.",neutral
"light and feels nice on skin. does leave a slight cast and a dewy finish. overall, pretty solid.",positive
"i bought this to use as the first step in double cleansing. i am super disappointed in the makeup remover function of this cleanser. i wear super light eye makeup and it does a terrible job of getting off my eye makeup. it is a nice oil cleanser in general, but not worth it if you are looking for a makeup remover.",negative
i use this once a week as a part of my weekly self-love day. i love to pamper my skin with this product and how radiant and beautiful i feel after. it is also so incredibly satisfying to use if you can get your hands on a sample from sephoras promos definitely grab it!,positive
you certainly need a second and foamy cleanse after using this. i do not feel it does a great job removing my eye makeup-- i have to use a micellar water after. has a very oily feel to it but sometimes does not feel like it is off your face even after multiple rinses. happy i only purchased the mini to try it.,negative
i have tried a few times and the color is nice but i always have streaks,neutral
"first, the design is super beautiful, it changes the usual bottles. i have been using it for over a week, mostly in the morning. i can see a great improvement. my skin is not as dry as before. it is more bluish and looks healthier. i like the freshness it gives the scent is really good. i highly recommend. freeproduct trywithtopbox",positive
got this in my free birthday gift and i am not a fan. it is effective at cleaning and removing makeupsunscreen but it dried my face out a lot. my skin was tight and was trying to start flaking and i had to double up on moisturizer to counteract it.normal or oily types will probably like it better but it is not for me.,neutral
the first time i ordered this it was amazing! i had to order it again because it really helped my skin and dark spots. even my acne scarring. the second time i ordered it.. yikes. smelled like burnt rubber. horrible. so hoping the next one that comes is better. we will see.,neutral
this product helps rid my face of pimples in literally one night. love that! it is also super inexpensive and gentle as well. i use this and then the niacinamide serum afterwards.,positive
"i do not often write reviews but i definitely felt cheated by this product. on my oily skin it was not matte. mybiggest gripe is that while it felt light weight and was beautiful immediately after application, within hours i was feeling shiny and my face was cracked. i am used to this happening around the nose, but this was everywhere. i was really hoping this would be the answer to my prayers, but unfortunately i will be continuing my quest for the perfect product.",negative
"dries out skin. wanted to like this but unfortunately, it is not gentle enough for those of us with sensitive skin.",negative
"serum feels nice, has a neutral smell. i am just not sure it does much of anything for my skin. does not really lend any kind of dewy or radiant glow. i received this product for free, and probably would not buy.",neutral
"i use this at night and i was attracted to the avocado ingredient. however, this created dry red spots around my eyes, it looked like someone punched me in the face. i do not have sensitive eyes at all, but my skin reacted horribly to whatever is in this. i am not new to eye creams either and i know my skin should not be reacting this way. returning and never repurchasing.",negative
"i really wanted to love this serum, but it caused breakouts on me. love the texture and silky finish. may work for others and i would recommend, but just not for me.",neutral
"i have had this product for about a week and the squeezy tube lid tore off the tube. if this product was cheaper i would not be so upset but this is a sunscreen and should not have such awful packaging malfunctions. i used my reward points on this and am very disappointed, which is a shame because the sunscreen itself if very beautiful and has a nice finish.",negative
honestly i did not notice a very big difference when using this. it is nice and light and non irritating but i do not think i will repurchase.,neutral
found a tiny black speck in my tube. i watched it come out of the spout. drunk elephant only offered a deluxe sample. i felt zero burning or stinging from using this product which usually happens when i use a retinol. even on the first use. not sure if vegan retinol is more gentle or what. i will have to see what it does to my skin over time.i do not love the packaging. it does not feel as high end as other de products. i do not see why they could not put this into a pump like other de products like their eye serums.,neutral
tried it today but it did not sting much for me. probably just for seconds. now it got me wondering if i used enough. any recommendations how much product needs to be used? i used it more like a serum.,neutral
"i guess i am the exception here, but i did not like this. i have it a few tries before my review. my skin is normal but tends on the drier side due to retin-a treatment. i have numerous skincare products to keep my skin moisturised and this product did not really keep my skin hydrated. also after using it i developed some mild acne on my chin not acne prone and that was the only product i changed in my routine. maybe works well for oily skin or with younger people? overall i did not see any added benefit with this and will not repurchase",negative
"this feels so refreshing when applied, but the first night i wore it i ended up with a puffy bump. the verdict is still out on this one.",neutral
the best makeup cleanser ever! i do use origins to do my second cleanse after but this is perfect for acne prone skin and have noticed a change in the texture of my skin after using it at night to remove makeup.,positive
"to be honest i have not been using it very frequently, but i think that the texture on my face has improved. as someone with very dry skin, this is not a cleanser that i have found dries out my skin further! would recommend",positive
"i have used other oilbalm type of removers before and they all worked well on removing my makeup, but this one right here...did not make me feel like a oil mess afterwards. best ever!",positive
i have dry skin and this is so far the best moisturizer i have used. i got the baby sample so i will be buying the big size. i put it on after a showerexfoliation and my skin is so soft! waking up in the morning with soft skin that shines a bit makes my makeup application seamless. this is it!!,positive
"this did not work for me. there was no improvement in puffiness or baggie-ness. there was a cakey white residue. moisturizer under and over did not help. makeup would not lay over it. just overall, i looked much worse for having used this product and had to wash my face and start over. first ptr product that i have hated.",negative
"i love this product so much and have been using it since january, but when i started to run out, i took it apart to try to get as much as i could out. in doing so, i realized the packaging is super deceiving. the only amount of product you actually get is in the small white container attached to the green top. the other is just a filler to make it seem like a larger amount. this is very deceiving and makes it extremely hard to justify the price for this product. i now wonder how many other de products have deceiving packaging. pretty disappointing.",neutral
"i received this product as a promotion but really did not like it, i have darker skin and there just was not enough coverage",neutral
it is a solid luxurious feeling eye cream in a stupid open air container. seriously biossance you are so much better than this. i hate dipping my long nails even though clean into this thing every night. it is ignorant. splurge for a pump! no top quality moisturizer with valuable ingredients should be packaged like this. it is stupid impractical. i cannot get the amount i want i have to dig it out of my fingernails and taint the rest of the product. argh!!!! would not rebuy based on this alone. they need to take a clue from drunk elephant who is packaging is so thoughtful and smart.,neutral
i have been using this consistently with no noticeable results. i am on months and still nothing. i have only been using on hands to lighten dark spots on knuckles.,neutral
so soft stayed moisturized throughout the day felt amazing under my eyes all day i will keep using hope it keeps up all this amazingness i received this complementary through influenster and i am just loving it,positive
some of the reviews said this product broke them out but i found the opposite. i have bad acne and moisturizers normally break me out but this one does not. would definitely recommend!,positive
"leaks, irritated my skin, smells kind of bad. i do not like the feeling on my skin. however, i did notice a difference on my skin. my tone was more even.",neutral
"it made my skin feel tight like it was begging for moisture. i have got combination skin but this is definitely meant for someone with more oily skin. it is very effective when used as a makeup remover so i will be using it as that from now on and go back to youth to the people, indie lee brightening cleanser or even cerave.",neutral
i did not care for this. it definitely feels more like a silicone base primer when applied vs a sunscreen and seemed to sit on top of my skin. it just was not for me but if you want a sunscreen that feels more like a primer this is for you!,negative
i have super dry skin and this was not enough hydration. maybe it would be good for someone with normal or oily skin.,negative
"highly overrated, overpriced. honestly, hold on to your hard earned and get the every man jack oil defense fragrance free face wash. it has the exact same bouncy jelly consistency, coconut based surfactants, aloe, glycerine, and is at whole foods!",negative
"i was really hoping that this was going to be a great primer because i absolutely love their foundatiom. the primer is horrible! when i squeezed the tube, it was like i was i had a tube of water. it was pure liquid.",negative
"meh. it is ok but it was not enough for my skin by itself, i needed to add a serum, oil and mist as well to my regime, and its sticky. smells good though lol",neutral
"definitely not nolow scent, smells and feels like dish soap and burns my eyes. not a fan.",negative
"was super excited to try this cleanser. it is a decent cleanser. however, it leave my face tighter than i am used to once i have rinsed my skin. the smell is not that great either. great for some, not for me. will be returning sadly.",neutral
the only reason i am giving this three stars is because it is not super expensive and has not made my under eye worse. i do not see any visible results.,neutral
"i received this product for my honest review. i used this product consistently am and pm for almost weeks with zero improvement. the two stars were for the consistency of the product, the luxurious bottle, and the smell fragrance is beautiful but other than than, i am so disappointed. this product made zero difference to the dryness, texture, feel, or look of my face. and for this price point, i would not be spending f my hard earned money on this. sorry guerlaine.",negative
"so far so good! works well, no scent. skin stays hydrated.",positive
i noticed an instant improvement of my skin texture and tone after just one use of this moisturizer. it has made my pores much smaller and my face smoother. this is great for the fallwinter months. it pairs well with farmacys honey moon glow serum. i love the container and the little spatula included so you will not have to dig your finger in.,positive
i never do reviews but since lapis has made such a big difference i wanted to review it. this product has cleared my skin out no more redness and blemishes appearing... my skin looks smoother and even toned i also bought algenist along with it and the both together have done wonders!!! will be restocking both of them..,positive
i received this product free for my honest review. it smells nice almost like a grapefruit smell but lighter. this night mask moisturizer seemed to pill on top of my night time routine. i was very disappointed but when i used it alone it seemed to work best. i now use it once a week as a night time mask by itself. works best that way for me!,neutral
"i have used quite a few luxury skin care items and do not care to spend money on products i feel are worth it. this is not one of them. i replaced a product i used for skin radiance with this one and after a month of consistent use, i noticed no difference. in fact my skin was losing the radiance i had worked so hard to get and i discontinued use of this and went back to my trusty product to bring my skin back to it is optimal health. i had read so many great reviews that i was so disappointed in this. i did not have unrealistic expectations but even realistic expectations were not met. i have normal to combination skin wothout noticable wrinkles and slight uneven skin tone with some dullness if not treated so maybe my skin was not severe enough but if yours is like mine then save the money. there are better products for cheaper than this",negative
i used this product on and off last year and i am finally about to finish the bottle. a couple things to note with this i feel like it does dry out your skin the first couple weeks which is the reason i stopped using it for about a month. after tweaking my routine by adding a vitamin c serum and a good night moisturizer my skin was pretty good. yes i would have occasional break out especially if i did not clean my face after wearing make up but overall it is not a bad product only reason i am not giving it a full five stars is because i did feel like it was pretty dry at first and i almost felt like i had to change my products by using theirs but i found other substitutes that were a lot more affordable but also great quality.,positive
"i used this toner in combination with caudalies vinopure line of cleanser, serum, and moisturiser. typically, the benefits should be enhanced by using the entire product line. in my case, it terribly worsened my facial acne.i was previously using fab facial radiance pads x daily followed by the originals lactic acid in the night. but i thought of switching over from this routine which was working for me, because of an impulse christmas value set purchase and caudalies brand name. within weeks my skin started breaking out and my face was covered with acne scars, the extent of which happens only when i am really stressed which i am not. i thought i would keep at it for a few more weeks, to give my skin a chance to adjust to this new routine. but weeks in and i break out very frequently and not just when i am menstruating on the previous routine i barely even broke out when i had my period, with cystic acne which i have not had in a really long time.for the price any price in fact, this product is a huge waste of money, time, and peace of mind.",negative
i found that this made my face skin kind of greasy and broke me out. i gave it three stars because it works fine on my decolletage and neck.,neutral
"was pretty pleased with the results, but honestly i started using paulas choice niacinamide and the results have kicked this one to the curb. add to that it is of the price and i am hooked.",neutral
"feels very greasy going on and sits on top of my skin, leaves me looking incredibly shiny. i have combination skin. will not be buying again.",negative
"i like this product a lot. i have very sensitive skin which easily breaks out. i cannot apply to my face all the produces with buzz words such as vitamin c, retinol, oils. it is different with protini, my skin loves it. i take down one star for the packaging huge piece of plastic. plus there is the pump, which is good for protecting against bacterial growth never was too much of concern for me, but definitely leaves a lot of pretty expensive product unused. i finished the cream in month, way faster than kiehls of similar volume.",neutral
"the smell is phenomenal. the idea is phenomenal. the lather is amazing. unfortunately, it does not moisturize as much as it advertises. when i use it in the shower, it makes my skin feel squeaky but it strips the moisture. when i come out the shower, my skin feels dry. i want to feel a softbuttery feel but it does not work on my skin. keep in mind i do live in a more drier climate so that may be a factor as well.",neutral
heavily fragrant i do not understand why companies still do thatnice consistency is about all i can say nothing special,negative
"this made me break out into tiny acne spots all over my forehead, chin and a bit on my cheeks. not for my oily skin",negative
"i was shocked that this product contains methylparaben. to quote of greatest concern is that parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity, reports the non-profit campaign for safe cosmetics csc.",negative
"the container is cute but the size is misleading, there is a much smaller amount of product than i expected. when i opened it i did not detect any scent at all. i scooped some into my hand and applied to my face on the way out the door, and immediately regretted that decision. it smells so bad, like something rancid! i was in a rush and had already left the house and had no way to wipe it off. after a minute in the car even my husband started complaining about the scent. it took nearly an hour for the smell to fade, ugh thankfully it was a long drive to where we were going because i would have been mortified to walk around in public smelling like this. then about minutes after applying i noticed my skin was stinging and burning. again, i had no way to wipe it off. i do not have sensitive skin and even scented products do not typically bother me. this was a nightmare experience from a brand i have never tried before, and i would not recommend!",negative
i love the packaging of this shelf tanning body mist. it is so pretty and colorful. i cannot wait to use it during the summer time. the scent is really nice too. it is not too strong so you will not be bothered.,positive
"i am a huge fan of supergoop! products. however, this is garbage. it is profoundly greasy and takes forever to dryset. i had to take a dry washcloth to dab away the grease. there is no way i will ever wear this again. yuck. do better supergoop!. this is so expensive for less than drugstore quality. garbage.",negative
"it works... ok i guess? for the price this is an incredibly disappointing product. i originally purchased both the body and the face drops, but after looking at the ingredients and seeing how high alcohol was on the face formula i knew i had to return. although i was more excited to try the face drops i went ahead with using the body formula. first, it is very perfumed, but it does not seems to be noticeable when you mix it in. while i initially loved the idea of mixing in the drops, i very quickly realized how much of a hassle it is. you need to use- drops per body part, and when you are applying body lotion or oil your hands become slippery and it is difficult to open the bottle back up so you need to leave it open, not that big a deal and also just to use the dropper with control. this products works best with body oil or traditional lotion, it does not work well with body butters or thicker lotions that are shea butter based. as for the color pay off, there is certainly a tan effect! depending on your mixing medium and the care you take to apply you will have more or less streaky or uneven coverage. the drop factor also means that you might have one body part darker than the other depending on the concentration you use. i bought the mediumdark, there is a noticeable difference in skin tone the next day and it is not too orange. all in all it is such a pain to deal with and nothing wows me for it besides the price in a bad way. i would much rather use my jergens in shower tanning lotion! i will not be repurchasing this.",negative
"i want to love this product soooo bad.... but.... so i got this as a sample and immediately obsessed. the formula, texture, the way it glides on your face and upon application just bursts into a water cloud, hence the name. i have been using this for over weeks now but it piles so bad, even when i am not wearing make up or spf or anything over top. interestingly, i never noticed this with my sample and i might have to return this unfortunately. i want it to work so bad! i have oily skin so it might work for others... i would say give it a try, but just not sure it works for me.",neutral
omg this works like a magic eraser for discoloring and acne scars if you are like me and have sensitive oily skin only use once a week,positive
"i will not suggest this if you have acne prone andor sensitive skin. this worked like magic the first few uses, but severely broke me out with continued use.",negative
pricey but i liked it! i think it is hard to tell if it really is anti aging for a short period of time,neutral
"i was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews i have seen for it, and i was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. my biggest complaint is how it pills. it is almost like it is not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. i tried different ways of applying using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc and it did it every time. i honestly would not mind it too much if it did not mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. my skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like i said earlier, it fills almost filmy. plus, i do not think it lives up to the intense hydration name. i looked at recent reviews after i started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. my acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that is a nice quality of it. will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling is not worth the price in my opinion.",neutral
"because of my sensitive skin i am usually hesitant to use serums- all others i have tried have because breakouts. this product is soft, not oily and has not caused any irritation. i have not seen any improvements in the texture of my skin but it does seem to help retain moisture. i will continue to use to see if there are any visible improvements. i received this product from influenster for free or complimentary for testing purposes.",neutral
"not worth the price, after i used it i felt like it left a waxy film on my skin. i really think that the other goop product the round microdermabrasion pad is so much better.",negative
"have not noticed a difference. the worst part is it is grainy and does not dissolve in any other products, so it feels like sand on my face. if it does not dissolve then what is the point?",negative
i am sure this works for many but i had to return it as it made me break out. very disappointed as i have always been interested in trying tatcha product and this was my first. oh well.,negative
does nothing! just neutral! save your money and move away if you are really looking for a retinol-type treatment. acts like a regular lotion-type serum that does nada!,negative
"this serum is very hydrating and smells good. it hydrate on my skin after i apply it. i use it also as a primer before putting on makeup, which i see my skin having a lighter tone and having a moisturize skin. the smell is like rose and it did not because any irritation at my face. gifted by rose inc",positive
"first, i must disagree with reviews that say this cream is too thick or hard to work with. i do not know what cream they have tried, but it is not this. the best thing about this product is the consistency and ease of use. it is aptly named because it literally feels and applies like silk and melts into your skin. you only need to barely rub your finger over cream as a tiny amount goes a long way. i have very sensitive, allergic eyes and have not had any problems with this and that is saying a lot. it is definitely one of the very best creams to use if you are going to apply makeup over it. it is an excellent primer base and will not run into your eyes in humidity, while exercising, etc. it is moisturizing enough for these purposes and better than not using anything. for these reasons i decided to keep this, but unsure if i would repurchase. it is definitely not doing anything for fine lines, circles or puffiness as promised and although i am, my eye area is very youthful, so i cannot imagine it working on anyone with more pronounced concerns. bottom line good primer for makeup good for very sensitive and or allergic eyes and would probably make a nice starter cream for someone in s. it is a shame that i do not see any real benefits because it is such a great, silky texture.",neutral
"so i bought this a long time ago and used it for a bit. i recently picked it back up because my skin was broken out like never before, but also dry and oily in odd places. i swear this fixed it all over night. i have one stubborn pimple left my fault, i popped it but other than that, a clear and soft complexion. i used this product alone and only at night and that is probably why it worked so well. sometimes less is better. highly recommend if you have combination skin.",positive
i usually like glow recipe but this made my eyes terribly dry and undereyes red and puffy. i use retinol and retinol eye masks and this has not really happened to me before so i was a bit disappointed in this.,negative
"i bought this after finishing the sunday riley ice ceramide moisturizing cream, and i got to say, the skinfix does the trick but does not feel as luxurious. no scent, and it does not feel as rich or absorb all that well. plus, the packaging is annoying. it is a very no frills, basic moisturizer. on to the next product...",neutral
made me break out and the smell is horrible. i love scented products but this smells like a bad batch of weed.,negative
"i received this product complimentary from kate somerville for review. i was excited to receive this because i have oily, acne prone skin and i get clogged pores. what i did not expect was such a thick consistency. belief has a gel cleanser that i love so i was expecting a similar consistency. this cleanser is thick and sticky, which i am not a fan off. the smell is weird also. it is an okay cleanser",neutral
"i definitely like this spray. it is supposed to defend against free radicals and i feel like it does that. i spray it in after my toner and before i put my serum on. unlike toner, you can definitely feel this on your face for a bit after you spray it but you know it is acting like a barrier. i do not feel like it is done a lot as far as adding moisture. my skin is still getting dry in the usual places. it has a funky smell like a lot of de products, but it dissipates quickly. overall, if you do not mind adding another step to your skincare routine i would recommend.",positive
this eye cream was gifted to me by innbeauty and came at a perfect time! i was getting dark circles under my eyes and this bright and tight eye cream has been working wonders! my dark circles have improved and i am very pleased!,positive

"this is every college students must have cleanser! my skin is generally pretty clear, but after nights of partying or if i am not getting the recommended hours of sleep a night, that takes a turn. i give this product all the credit when it comes to keeping my face clear and clean. it is great for removing left over make up, as well as getting rid of all of the bad decisions i have ever made in my life. there really is nothing like this product on the market, it is just a must have! the price does not make me the happiest, but knowing i am not wasting my money on a crap product makes up for it.",positive
"i received a sample with my recent order and tried it fresh out of the shower, loved it! so smoothing and left my skin looking amazing and clear. i left it on for several hours and fell asleep, does not feel like a mask, more like a moisturizer. i want to purchase a full size but i am worried because there are so many other reviews saying it was stinging their skin and left it irritated. sometimes samples are better than the actual product? i cannot decide what to do",positive
"this is a really nice toner that does what it claims to do. i love the well-pump it has for application, you just place a cotton pad over it and press down, usually one to two pumps is enough for me. i have been using this every morning and night for weeks and the bottle is still more than three quarters full. it does not have a fragrance as listed under the ren clean skincare label along with other things it does not have. it offers very gentle exfoliation on my drycombination aging skin and even completely got rid of some tiny flesh colored bumps i was starting to get under my eyes, which surprisingly did not irritate the surrounding eye area. my skin does feel a little bit sticky after application, but nothing too bothersome. it really gets rid of any remaining dirt and dead skin cells after washing my face. i have also noticed an actual glow with continued use of this product. i have a lot of little dark hyperpigmentation spots from a deep laser resurfacing treatment i had a year ago and am trying out everything to see what works on them. i think this does make my skin more even toned, but i am also currently using korres wild rose vitamin c oil and their moisturizers that claim to lighten dark spots. either way, i will continue to buy this toner as i find it does not dry out my skin like other toners i have tried before and it makes my skin feel nice and look healthier.",positive
"i wanted to love it. i really did.the smell is light and somewhat refreshing as expected from the notes.i do notice i am using probably more than i should but it does take a lot to foam up.at the end of the day, it is a cleanser. and there are better ones out there, some with a better price point as well.",neutral
"cannot get over the smell- like burnt plastic or hair. it is absolutely disgusting, and i always have not seen a different in my skin.",negative
"have started using it, the product feels good on the skin and a little goes along way!",neutral
"i received this gorgeous serum complimentary from sulwahsoo in exchange for my honest review. this serum is a thin, watery, gel-like consistency. it is sort of the color of maple syrup like the photos show and smells quite herbal. the scent is not too strong and fades quickly, so it is not bothersome. it instantly makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. this is great for morning and or evening. i think it is really nice for hydration and making my skin look and feel healthy and nourished. it is not too light nor too heavy. it is not greasy or sticky. it is perfect under any moisturizer and i did not have any issues with the texture or application. i actually found this very enjoyable to use and find that one pump is more than sufficient for my entire face, neck and decolletage area.",positive
"the only reason why i gave it stars versus is because of the bottle easy dispensery pump, no spills, no leaking...otherwise, this product is not effective. after pumps of the product vigorous massage, my makeup was not completely removed. i would recommend clinique makeup removing balmoil or if you can afford to splurge then buy farmacy makeup removing balm. do not waste your money on caudalie.",negative
i really wanted to like this product but i am pretty sure i had a reaction to the fragrance that is in it. it felt nice until my face lit up like rudolphs nose. i really do not have sensitive skin either. it rarely even gets dry. but i definitely would not recommend purely due to the fragrance and the terrible bottle design.,negative
excited to try it but it does not work on my combination skin. i returned it.,neutral
love this mask! it is super creamy so a little goes a long way. clarifying but also gentle on your skin. my favourite yttp product!,positive
picked it up during a off. tried it a couple of times and each time it left my face red and blotchy. my face felt tingly and itchy after. will be returning this item post-lockdown.,negative
"i have been using the algenist genius skin resurfacing bha toner for a couple of weeks for my acne prone areas. i love the glass bottle and green shades. it does not sting or dry out my skin, which of course is ideal, but can happen with acids. it has a pleasant light scent and quickly absorbs into my skin. obviously, i use spf when using this product in the am. i have not really noticed a difference in breakouts on my chin which i think i am getting from mask wearing. i continue to get little breakouts here and there, but i am hoping this toner makes a difference because i typically like algenist products and appreciate the clean formulas. the salicylic acid i use right now does not have the cleanest formula, so i am looking for a replacement.",neutral
it is okay not a wow moment for me but i will say it feels good on my face it does not feel like i have a mask on how ever i wish it smelled like something,neutral
"i got to try this, the inky list caffeine eye-cream out and i am a diy lover so before i got my hands on this product i used regular coffee grinds not the same at all but better. i noticed my under bags going away. i used it about week or so and i am impressed, it did my under eyes good. and i loved that i just used a bit on my finger tip and tap it on. no stinky smell too it or bad texture and it just went on good under my eyes and did not irritate them. plus good night sleep and use your serum and moisturizer as well. sure made my under eyes bright.",positive
kiehls ferulic brew rejuvenating facial essence is great addition to every routine. my skin is hydrated and moisturized. it is a great base under my make up. i like it a lot and highly recommend.,positive
i did not care for these drops. i felt it left a strange tone and made my skin look very uneven. thought i would give it a try... i use the clarins tanning drops every day with my moisturizer and do not have that problem. i will stick with it.,negative
"after reading a couple reviews about breakouts i decided to pick up a sample of this to try before i bought the full size. sad to say i also broke out, i was really hoping this would work for me.",neutral
"i wanted to wait a month before posting this review in case this product took a while to show results, but after a month i have not noticed much of a difference. i was hopeful since some reviewers here said it helped their acne and shrunk pores, but it did neither for me. i still breakout and pores look the same. it did help fade some old scars a little, though.",negative
"i like the way it made my skin feel but it broke me out. i had suspicion it was this, since it is the only thing i changed in my routine because so many people recommended this. the minute i stopped washing my face with it, my skin cleared up in days. so i gave it to my sister since normally things that do not work for me will work for her. she broke out within days of using it and immediately stopped and now over night after washing her face with her regular cleanser her breakout went down significantly.",negative
"i used this product every night until it ran out and i honestly cannot see the slightest difference. it did not irritate my skin or make me break out, but it also did not reduce the appearance of my acne scars, even out my skin tone, or soften my smile lines in the least bit.",negative
"this product was the biggest beauty letdown. it smells beautiful and clean, it feels luxurious, but it breaks me out so badly and it takes a while for my skin to recover.",negative
i did not love this. i used it with the ordinary hydraulic serum and found it did not absorb very well.,neutral
"i am half way down my bottle and i can say i have not seen an improvement from my skin. it is definitely a more lightweight oil and absorbs more quickly than most facial oils i have tried. for some reason i also get breakouts on my forehead when i use it more than- times in a row. overall it was an okay product,not really for me.",neutral
"i was excited to receive this complimentary product from influenster to test and review. first, the refillable aspect of this moisturizer is genius. second this ultra-rich moisturizer deeply hydrates, brightens and soothes. i love the scent i smell as i apply the cream. it makes me feel as if i am pampering myself. the moisturizer is gentle and has not caused any type of allergic reaction for me, which speaks highly of the quality ingredients kora used. i have only applied the turmeric glow moisturizer for a few days, so it is too soon to confirm the claims that it reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation, dark spots, dullness and fine lines wrinkles.",positive
"i was really excited to try this, sadly this was too tacky for me. i read all the reviews and used just a small amount, but by the end of the day my face was tacky and shiny. had to return. it may be great for people with extremely dry skin though.",negative
"this left my face feeling way too tight. it did a good job of cleansing my skin--it felt clean--but immediately after rinsing my face tightened up and felt completely stripped of any and all moisture that was previously there. i have combination skin and even my t-zone felt too stripped. i gave the rest to my boyfriend who uses it to wash off his zinc based sunscreen, and although it gets every last bit off it is just too drying for my everyday cleansing needs. a massive round of applause always to the clean ingredients and minimal plastic packaging, though!!",neutral
"i received this product free for testing purposes from influenster and peter thomas roth. this stuff will exfoliate your skin it is the perfect amount of grit! i definitely noticed a difference in my pores after the first use! it did not get rid of all of my blackheadsclogged pores completely, but definitely did a number on them!! will for sure be using this again!",positive
"this product does what it says, but there is nothing special about it especially not for the price. i had heard so many great reviews and some people rave about it, but i honestly did not notice much of a difference. i gave it stars as it is good, and i enjoy the product, but i definitely will not be repurchasing and if you already have a great exfoliator i would skip this.",neutral
"i wanted to like this product. at first the smell was slightly unpleasant and oily, as noted in the description. but after weeks, it started smelling like fish oil. i cannot stand the smell of fish oil and definitely cannot deal with it on my face. also, there was no noticeable change in my skin. it is no different from argan oils and jojoba oils that i have tried.",negative
"disappointed- the wishful is promoted as a deep exfoliating product but it actually is not removing dead skin but actually the product is piling or clumping. waste of money, there is so many products out there with wayy better results at a better price. will not be buying full size again.",negative
"i have always used the ordinaty squaline cleanser as my first cleanse to break down my makeup. i loved it but wanted to try something new and this oat cleansing balm was much cheaper per ounce. i have tried it twice to give it a fair shot and was very hopeful because i like many of the inkey list products. this oat cleansing balm is gritty hurts to rub on my eyes and sensitive skin, hard to squeeze out of the bottle too thick for such a tiny nozzle, and did not break down my eye makeup well especially my mascara which is not even water proof. after double cleansing i still had makeup left around my eyes. i have never written a review on here and have never returned a sephora product but i will be returning this tomorrow. i am so disappointed. if you are debating between this and the ordinary, definitely go with the ordinary!",negative
does not really work for dark spots. i have been using this product about two months and does not really see any change. it is a great moisturizer. i have normal to oily skin,negative
"in all honesty, i really do not get the hype about this product. it is a perfectly fine, heavy duty moisturizing cream, with some questionable ingredients, but there are several other much less expensive though by no means cheap creams that i prefer. i gave it stars because it is very rich and deeply hydrating, but i will never purchase it again. i much prefer algenist genius cream and sleeping collagen, which are both significantly less expensive. in the end, because of the cost, i cannot recommend this when there are more effective products available for half the price.",positive
i read a lot of reviews on this saying that it burned their eyes or tingled after application but i have not had that issue yet. it is a little of the thicker side in comparison to other eye creams i have tried but i think that is a benefit for the colder winter months. i have not really noticed a difference in the brightness or texture of my under eye area i have been using it for weeks now but the area is vey soft and smooth.,neutral
"it is not sticky at all, even though it is thick, it melts into your skin with a very small amount. after you apply it your skin look hydrated, plumped radiant with a glow effect, ready to put makeup for a flawless look. i have been more confident with the apparence of my face, my skin looks more healthier, soft, smooth and moisturize. my makeup is looking very good since i started to use it. i have been receiving a lot compliments about my skin lately and people does not believe me that my age is more than forty. so how about that my friends, i am the happiest woman in the world. remember hyaluronic acid, vitamins c and e, and bionymph peptide complex are the key in this cream to have less wrinkles and younger look instantly.",positive
this product does not do anything to my skin in terms of skin care but it is great for applying before concealer foundation to make them easier to apply and not dry up my skin. there are primers for that though. i will not be buying this anymore.,neutral
"i bought these for my birthday to give myself a little colour, and oh my goodness do i ever love this!!!!! i applied drops to my moisturizer before i went to bed woke up with a beautiful non-orange glowing tan! highly recommend! i am also fairly pale and i purchased the dark drops, i feel like it will last me longer because i do not have to use as many drops and i would if i got light or medium!",positive
broke me out extremely bad i wanted to love this as my go to spf but it is not for my sensitive acne prone skin,negative
the serum itself is good. it absorbs nicely into my skin and does not leave a sticky residue or make my makeup or sunscreen pill. the bottle is tiny though. i wish they had an option of a bigger bottle for or instead of having to purchase the small ones. it seems like a waste of plastic bottles and shipping boxes. one small bottle only lasts about a month maybe less if used daily.,neutral
similar consistency to the protini polypeptide cream but less moisturizing. my skin does not seem to absorb this like drunk elephants moisturizer. my skin is just too dry for this product i think. and what in the world is the packaging? is a pump like this really necessary? guess it is a cool concept but you will have to open the container and use it like a jar eventually.,neutral
"this serum feels nice going on but i do not think the results justify the hefty price tag. many people have touted this as being a holy grail product so i guess i was expecting more. this just goes to show that maybe if they had a more competitive price my opinion would change, but for now i will go ahead and stick with more affordable options that produce results.",neutral
complimentary from the brand moon juice.i have been trying the super you daily stress management pills by moonjuice for over two weeks now. to be perfectly honestly i do not really see a difference. and this is my honest opinion.,neutral
great product at a great price! do not underestimate the sephora brand products! they are great!,positive
"i do not want to say that this does not work because because my sister used it for her acne scarring and it worked for her. maybe i have not used it for that long to really see results. i have minor scarring thanks to me thinking i am dr. pimple popper and picking at my blackheads pimples. this has a weird serum oil consistency, it did not really absorb. my sister gave me the tip to mix it with my moisturizer. i feel that lactic acid works better for me. with the lactic acid, i wake up to dewy skin. this may work for some. for the price it is worth to try. keep in mind everyone is skin is different.",neutral
"i got tired of paying an exorbitant amount for vitamin c serums that irritated my skin or oxidized before i could finish them. niacinamide is an amazing ingredient that is much more stable. this serum is lightweight, hydrating, and feels amazing on the skin. it is made my skin look brighter and overall more even. i love it!",positive
"purchased the smaller size through helloava. i have been using for about a week, and think it is just okay. not in love. this moisturizer is pretty heavy, and has a fairly stickytacky feeling that i do not enjoy. can also give me a tingly feeling upon use i have sensitive and dry-combo skin. i now use this in the am only, as my last step before spf. does leave skin feeling soft. however, i have used other moisturizers that i have loved more- i think i will buy a separate vitamin c serum in conjunction with a tried and true moisturizer, once i use up the rest of this jar. it does smell like oranges, but the smell is like that of a very strong essential oil. or like you just ate a cutie, and did not wash your hands afterwards. the ole henrikksen vitamin c products in comparison, have a delightful creamsicle scent that i prefer.",positive
amazing for my dry skin. i use it as the last step in my routine before i go to bed and wake up glowing. my skin looks much less dull.,positive
i had really high hopes but was disappointed... i was looking for a mask to clean my pores and improve the overall texture of my skin. while it felt pleasant on my skin it did not do much. definitely will not be repurchasing.,negative
"does not work for my dry skin, feels oily on skin and feels like it just sits on top",neutral
"streaky and orange. i purchased because of all the great reviews but very confused by them. i was really excited to try this product, but each time would get awful results. i am not sure what i am doing wrong or if it is just a poor product.",negative
i like this product is not loded with fragrances as well as it not having the sunscreen smell. my face feels soft threw the day and dose not make it oily. the pacaging is unique and cute witch is a plus.,positive
"vitamin c serum works amazingly and is not sticky like some others i have tried. this really helped brighten my dark spots when i used it everyday sometimes twice per day and keeps my skin looking glowy, supple and hydrated. love this stuff truthfully this entire line is pretty flawless, i love everything except for the cleanser. i am not really into the creamy cleanser but an esthetician that i know told me it was good for resurfacing and renewing the skin.... i think i will stick to my murad gel cleanser though lol i highly recommend this product",positive
"i got this as a recommendation from a friend who swore it was her holy grail. i do not know if it is because we have different skin types, but this has done nothing for me, which is disappointing considering the price. i have oily skin and this feels heavy, like it just sits on top of my skin. i do feel a strong tingle upon applying but i do not see a glow per se in the morning.",neutral
"it does the job. it came as a sample in a gift from my boyfriend, and while it does moisturize and nourish the skin, i have used better moisturizers at better price points. it is very rich, so it may be worth it to someone with very dry skin and aging concerns, but at least for me, there are better options available.",neutral
"considering both the price and outstanding reviews of this product, i was highly disappointed. thankfully, my sensitive skin did not experience adverse effects from usage, but there were also no noticable improvements with the texture of my skin. i would not repurchase as there are much better alternatives that are also kinder to the bank.",negative
"removes facelip makeup very well, but because it is so thicc and goopy with very, very little slip, removing mascara is difficult. if you are not careful, you will rip your eyelashes out. i ended up buying another brand for my eyes, and i use this one for everything else.",neutral
i am not convinced this does anything. it feels nice on my skin but my oil has not changed any and i have been using it daily for months,neutral
"do not believe the hype online about this stuff. why does a facial spray need added color and fragrance? it smells nice but does nothing for your skin, and it is hard to tell what is actually in it.",negative
"smells like hotdogs cooked in a campfire. it may work fine, but the smell is so bad i could not use it for more than a single day.",negative
"sooo i wanted to love this but cannot. i am giving stars because it definitely does the job of hydrating. i felt that, but it is also suppose to be for people with sensitive skin and this broke me out! which sucks because like i said, the hydration was amazing. i would just caution you to be careful, do a test patch before applying to your face.",neutral
"melts makeup away really well but unfortunately consistently broke me out, i used it for a full month to make sure it was not just a purge that would get better and sure enough, for the whole month i was getting tiny whiteheads regularly, which i rarely get. pretty dissapointing",negative
i do not recommend this at all. it does not spread even though they say to put pea sized on your finger. did not really do anything. even for it was a waste of money. also if you put moisturizer after it just stars peeling and falling off??,negative
"it is ok. not the best, not the worst. i do not feel like it is any better than drugstore cleansers. it does not dry my already dry skin which is a positive but i feel like i have to exfoliate more often when using it because it just washes the surface. i would not buy it again.",neutral
"i thought it is a unique approach for a wrinkle reduction through a patch form. love that it is free of sls and formaldehydes and has retinol and vitamin c to help brighten the skin,but dint show much effect in reducing the wrinkles.may be in the long run it might show a little effect but overall a good approach and easy to use patches.",neutral
"i received this for testing purposes from influenster. this sunscreen goes on smoothly and is not sticky or greasy, but it is expensive and it pills after a while when you rub it, and the pilling is visible on your skin. i expect better quality for the price of this.",neutral
"hydrating, but that is about it. i had high hopes for this. i have really dry skin but my under eye area needs a serum as well, i think. love tatcha products but this one unfortunately just feels like a moisturizer, nothing too significant to notice.",negative
"i have hyperpigmentation from acne i used ole henriksons truth serum, it did not do anything except my skin look glowy. i tried this one for two months, it feels great on the skin and it does brightens the skin but not enough to help with hyperpigmentation or scars. i do not think it is worth it for the price, but if it works for you that is awesome",neutral
"before i used this product, my skin was clear. i very rarely get zits. after one week of using this product i am breaking out so bad. i can go out all night, eat pizza, then pass out and wake up with no zits but currently i have zits on my left cheek alone. i do not have sensitive skin, i have tried tons of products and nothing has ever made me break out this bad before. i combined this with the caffeine for your eyes. i will discontinue use of both products.",negative

"okay, i got a couple sample of this in one of my online sephora orders. i loved it. so i purchased the mini size because i could not commit to the price of the full size. and thank the lord i did not!!! the pros if you have dry skin, it is crazy thick. and it smells decent.the cons i had to find just the perfect amount that works for my skin thru trial error otherwise my extra product is so hard for my skin to absorb my skin was greasy. i have really dry skin so at first it did not bother me. but then i noticed depending on which sunscreenprimer combo i use after this moisturizer, it always pills!!!!! always! it was hard for me to find a combination of my products that works well with this. considering the price for even the small size!!, you would expect having no issues at all with this. but nope. i do still use it at night sometimes on days when i am feeling extra dry but i have completely stopped using this as a daytime moisturizer because it is just too heavy, does not absorb well into my skin, and does not always interact well with my other products. so there is my review and no, i will not be purchasing this again.",neutral
"the product smells amazing and is very creamy. i think if you have normal to dry skin and is looking for something spa like to treat yourself. this will work nicely, it does help with makeup application and add hydration however nothing that a little bit of cerave or aveeno cannot do. it does not work at all for my very dry textured skin. if anything i feel like my skin is slightly drier after applying this and applying makeup. i do really enjoy the smell and how it feels when first applied but for me ultimately it did not meet my need especially at this high price point. would not recommend for people with very dry skin like me.",neutral
my skin feels amazing in the morning! this product works wonders.,positive
"i absolutely love this stuff. i use it every morning and night! i am going to have to buy another bottle soon! it makes my face feel fresh, and my skin so soft and smooth!",positive
this made me break out so bad. i rarely break out!,negative
so sad! it used to be my hg...my skin never looked better. now the formula is different and my skin is full of bumps. too bad they broke something that did not need to be fixed,negative
"this is my first time using a toner. this product has a thicker consistency. it looks like a watery lotion, but applies thin and smooth on skin and absorbs quickly. my skin looks more radiant and smooth. although, i should mention that i also started taking collagen and using a retinol serum. i would purchase again.",positive
it is ok. i was pretty underwhelmed by this product. it does not do much i have combo skin and my fine lines definitely stayed around vs other moisturizers,neutral
"this is my favorite face sunscreen. great serum-like texture, absorbs quickly, and smells like peaches! most importantly, it does not burn my eyes. it also lasts for a long time before i feel the need to reapply. holy grail for sure!",positive
this mask dried my face out so bad it looked like i had a burn. i used this mask times and it completely dried my face out. i was so disappointed i returned it. i had really high hopes that this would help with the canadian winter i was wrong.,negative
"i bought this primarily to be placed on the high points if my face for that natural glow on no make up days. i do enjoy it although i have not paid attention to how long it actually lasts looking dewy on the skin. sure, the packaging is a little silly think push pop but i have not been so put off by it like others... i just use the plastic cover top it came with to push it back down. nbd. overall, i like this but still unsure if i would repurchase. time will tell!",positive
a little goes a long way but the smell is really heavy. getting a headache from the smell.,neutral
"do not get me wrong, the formula is great. the issue i have with this product is the packaging. you cannot hold the side of the product without the sunscreen spilling out. you can have the lightest touch and it will still spill. it just seems like the product is wasting and for the price it is just not worth it. you are basically buying half of the bottle because the other half will spill out overtime. if the packaging was different it would be stars but the packaging just ruins this product.",negative
really confusing instructions... it says rub the product in your hands to warm it up until it becomes an oil? i did that multiple times and it did not work. this product did not work well for me.,neutral
"i came across this line while browsing sephora during their spring savings event back in april. i have been using this moisturizer since and cannot think of one negative thing. i have acne prone oily skin and i introduced this at a time where i was pregnant and my skin was complete garbage because of my hormones. unlike clinique moisture surge, this does not burn or leave a tingling feeling on your skin, smells lovely, formulated with clean ingredients and really does a lovely job at hydrating skin without it feeling oily or looking oily! works perfectly under my makeup and even at night, although i recently purchased yttp overnight mask specifically for night. also, this also layers beautifully under my supergoop sunscreen and my primers. i was hesitant due to the price, this is why i purchased during the sale but i have realized that this jar will last you since a little goes a long way. only feedback i have for the company is that they should really consider adding some sort of spatula with the product so that we do not have to continuously dip fingers in the jar.",positive
one it does not drop you have no clue how much your putting in your lotion.. two.. i shaved exfoliated really good it streaks really bad no matter what and it is supposed to be dark it is definitely light.. very disappointed worst self tanner i have ever bought! loving tan is where it is at!,negative
"purchased this twice in the past and i loveddd this gentle foam cleanser perfect for my sensitive combo skin. however, when i bought this new bottle, i felt something was off... i compared the ingredients between my old and new bottle and there were only minor changes, so there should not be a drastic difference, right?! i used it consistently for two weeks and it was the only change to my skincare routine. sadly, my skin became drier and i had more whitehead appear throughout the weeks. i returned this product and am now back on the hunt for a new cleanser staple",positive
it is not bad but i have to squeeze the tube several times before applying so it does not come out watery. it moisturizes fine but i have not seen any significant improvement in my eye area.,neutral

"coming from a low maintenance facemakeup regimen that needs to be quick and on the go mom of and right now i loved the refreshing feeling of the spritz with the lavender scent... like a mini spa. that feeling went away after a few minutes when i used it routinely and overall i do not think it changed my skin much. to be honest, i do not use it as much as needed. not recommended for a low maintenance mama",neutral
this moisturizer is the best i have tried! no more dry patches or breakouts. and a little goes a long way.,positive
got a sample and thought it smelled heavily of alcohol! upon checking out ingredients i discovered alcohol denat to be the fourth ingredient. would not purchase.,negative
got this as a free sample from influensters. i really do not have much to say because this irritated my skin. it might just be a lil to strong for my sensitive skin. but again everyone is different and everyone can or may not get a reaction. wish my skin tolerate it and give it a try but my skin did get a reaction. sorry but would have loved to give it a try out!,negative
only good thing about it is its hydrating. but its too sticky and does not do anything. prefer timeless matrixyls serum,negative
"i had originally purchased the small bottle and loved the consistency therefore, during the black friday sale, i decided to purchase the bigger bottle which was on sale. i received it about a week ago and the consistency is totally different. the bigger bottle has a more runny, liquid feel to it than the small bottle. it also sits and soaks in different on my face. total disappointment!!",negative
"i bought this last year and it worked so good with my skin definitely hydrating moisturizing. i purchased it again i was disappointed not sure if they changed ingredients, it did not do anything for my skin the second time i finished it in less than months trying to moisture my face. i recommend it if you are face is not really dry, if you have really dry skin id look for a different moisturizer",neutral
really like this product but so pricey. it feels awesome on my face and i love that it is clean but i went through it kind of fast and the price may not work for me.,neutral
i do not use this moisturizer by itself however it is my last step in my skin care regimen and i have to say it gives me a nice glow and it keeps my face moisturized throughout the night. i woke up the next morning and my skin was glowing and still felt hydrated! i like it. works well with other skin scare products. did not break me out,neutral
this did not work to treat emerging acne. would not recommend.,negative

not sure about the actual product because the rolling ball applicator did not work. returned it.,neutral
i have been using this every night for close to months and there is no difference. this was a waste of money.,negative
"first thing first, this product is so cute and i really love that it is refillable. this moisturizer has pudding-like texture and spreads nicely on my skin. it can be a bit sticky sometimes but it does not bother me at all. my skin looks hydrated enough using this but i just do not like the sweet bubble gum scent of this cream. the concept is cute and i love how aesthetically this moisturizer looks. but i think this product is perfect for young adults. i received this product for free in exchange of my honest opinion.",positive
"i do not really like this. i will give it stars because it does not irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin and my skin does not feel stripped after using this. however, it does a terrible job removing mascara and i almost always have to go behind it with micellar water to get the excess mascara off. another negative, i end up rubbing my area more than i want to and it does make my vision a little blurry for a few minutes afterwards. also, it only half way removes foundation. obviously, i plan to double cleanse afterwards but there should not be soo much leftover makeup on, considering i am pretty light handed with my makeup application. prior to this, i used beliefs cleansing balm and it removed everything on its own. after i finish this, i will not repurchase.",negative
"i have received sample sizes on two occasions with my online purchases and liked its performance and scent. it is my first intro into balm cleansers and i was impressed how it removes my super-waterproof mascara and sunscreen foundation in one-go, without any tugging on my delicate eye area. now, supposedly i would have immediately came online and ordered myself a pot had it not been that both times i tried the samples, it blurred my eyes for about mins after using. i know it is only my personal experience but it did leave me hesitant. then online i go and found another korean balm that is also highly rated but not available on sephora, the heimish all-clean cleansing balm, with a flip-open top for easy one-hand operation. the heimish has been my best pal since, and ml costs only cdn roughly usd, and performs just as good. on full-makeup days i would use the balm cleanser as a first cleanse, which takes off all my super waterproof mascara and spf foundations, followed by a regular face wash as insurance that nothing is left behind.i still rate this cleansing balm with stars because it is a clean product that removes very stubborn makeup without stripping the skin same as heimish, but knocked off two stars for the negative eye-blurring it caused me personally as well as the pricier price point compared to the heimish. just wished sephora would carry the heimish cleansing balm as well for easier access, but for those who do not mind the higher price point and do not have sensitive eyes, this is a very good balm-cleanser.",neutral
"the first week i used these they seemed to be doing a great job, the second week, however,,i had a heck of a time getting the adhesive to stick, to clean dry skin, and they were falling off during sleep",neutral
"o-m-g. i used this one day, applied with a mitt, left on for hours, showered it off, and i was completely orange the next day and so streaky. can you say oompa loompa?? i love the tan-luxe butter lotion and thought this would be a quickereasier way to get tan without being so time consuming, but do not waste your money or breath sis.",negative
"if you have dry-normal skin, this may be too heavy to use as a day cream. works well as a night cream though.the cream has a light purple tint and a mild scent that disappear when you apply it to your face. the texture is quite thick, so i recommend taking a pea size amount and rubbing it between your palms to warm up the product before applying to your face. it does make your face look dewy upon application but i have not noticed any improvement in my skin with continued use.",neutral
